"'I have one of those too. Started fooling around with a small traction kite some years back. It was fun to fly but wasn\'t really big enough to pull anything. So I went online and found a bigger one. Bigger, in this context, meaning a 7,something square meters quadline beast, because you know... it\'s just a kite... how hard could it be, right? \nA friend and I went to the beach to test it out. Wind was maybe 3-5 kts that day. Having only watched the instructions video that came with it and knowing nothing else about how to handle a kite that size, I got it rigged and airborne. I put it in the ""park zone"" (where it flies but doesn\'t pull....that much) just to get a feel for it and such. After a while I felt confident enough to try a little maneuvering.... and this is where it all started to go south. As soon as it got in the ""window"" it suddenly developed the pulling power of a f*cking freight train. The sheer power of this thing caught me completely by surprise but I managed to stay on my feet.... initially. My friend watching from the sideline saw that I was having a little trouble and ran to me and grabbed me in an attempt to try and keep me grounded. I gained a little control and told him it was ok. He could let me go, I can handle it. \nNot one split second after having said that and him letting go there was a gust of wind. Now, I\'m a big guy so it wasn\'t enough to lift me like in the video, but it pulled me off my feet and dragged me for about 15-20 meters through the sand nose first, no doubt earning me the title of the fastest human windpowered plough on the beach that day.

The rating system I feel at Snowbird compares to other resorts (the easiest blue run from the top is a graded road that trucks can drive up). And Snowbird has some of the best beginner terrain and a very good mountain school for anyone. They have two whole chairs for just beginners and families. You could even find beginner terrain at the top of the mountain and ride the tram down if you wanted to. Snowbird should not be shammed for it's bolstering expert only terrain as they cater to every skier and anyone should be able to feel safe and in control on their ski hill.

A Senco gun (apparently designed to rapid fire nails as long as the trigger was depressed).   I turned it toward me (to nail the board) and apparently missed the board.  It fired 3 nails in rapid succession.   I let go of the board and it fell to the ground.   As I looked down wondering why it didn't stay, I noticed glints of gold sticking out of my chest.    The nails were in about 1.5 inches (luckily not in my heart as this guy).   I pulled them out, put a piece of duct tape over the holes and went back to work.

Now she's the type of person who doesn't like the highway due to being in a couple accidents back in the day due to drunk drivers, so she takes the back roads. Normally it takes about 2.5 hours to drive up from home, but her way is more like 4. \n\nShe makes it home just fine and tells my aunt just in passing that she fell up at the cottage and her hip was kinda sore from it. Immediately (of course) my aunt starts saying she needs to go to the hospital because it's probably broken, but she's adamant that she's fine and it's just a bruise or what have you. But eventually she gets her to go with her to the hospital and sure enough it's broken.\n\nI can't even imagine what I would do in that situation, much less trying to drive back home for 4 hours.

Instead of cutting the bottom of the tree, he immediately started cutting the limbs of the tree with a chainsaw. If you've seen people do this, they stand on the tree and walk down it cutting the limbs at their feet as they go. Doing this, he finally removed enough weight from the tree that it sprung straight up and launched him through the air, landing on the ground rendering him unconscious.\n\nHe comes to and the chainsaw is laying next to him, handle broken and throttle completely open, with the saw laying of his body sideways lightly cutting into his abdomen.

The bathroom was connected in the same hallway to my bedroom. You\'d open the door to my room and smell it for like an hour after, it was feral. But the absolute worst part was, when he\'d be drunk or wake up in the middle of the night, he\'d almost never flush. I don\'t know why...he also used to make yelping noises too. So when my friends would sleep over we\'d be playing games at like 2am during summer vacation and hear ""Daaaaaahhhh"". When one of us would go to use the bathroom after and see everything just sitting there looking at us. we\'d say ""The cookie monster struck again"". Reason for the nickname is because for some time he was on a kick with Pilsbury cookies. He\'d cook an entire batch and eat them all himself. His flushing inconsistencies lasted literally months \n\nBut it really did bring the day down. Also his signature was when toilet paper ran out he would put on a fresh roll, then take the used one and put it on the back part of the toilet for someone else to throw away. \n\nThank you for reading. \n\nEDIT: A lot of people have asked if he\'s alive.

What is weird about Dave was, being as open with  his farting.. was how poo-shy he was. Every day after lunch he would drown his shits in original scent Pine-Sol to mask the smell.

"""Probably not gonna be read by anyone, but with everyone else sharing poop stories, might as well share mine. Me and a couple buddies (all early 20's) are at a buddies house drinking. One guy (Michael) passes out in his bedroom but we partied for about another hour and a half before calling it a night. Kevin decided that he was gonna crash in Michael's floor, but went to use the bathroom first. 15-20 minutes later, he walks out, goes to Michael's bedroom and finds Michael laying down in the floor, pants halfway down, face down, holding his tallywacker, in a pool of what we found out was urine. Kevin basically said fuck it, told us, and went to sleep on the couch. After me and Greg clean up Michael's shit show, we smelt an odor. A rather foul odor. Walked into the bathroom to find a literal football (NFL, not NCAA or Varsity, NFL size) turd sitting in the toilet. How in the hell Kevin pushed that thing out of him is beyond me, but I said to leave it till morning and make Kevin clean it. Greg decided to clean it himself. Walked outside to get a stick and dumbass doesn't get one off of a tree, he gets a dead one with bark and leaves on it, walks into the bathroom and tries to break it up. We made Kevin and Greg clean the mess, but when I went to piss that morning (forgetting everything that happened) and saw a stick and dead leaves halfway to the ceiling, bark and leaves on the ground, delicately sitting in a 10 Ib. turd like the sword in the stone, I started reconsidering my friend choices.\n\nEdit: Also YouTube Donald Glover Home Depot, great pooping story.""",912ubx

"'I thought it was bad when all we had was the guy who peed orange tang on all parts of the urinal every day... Then we got guy who took penny dumps. My buddy coined (badum tss) the term after being unfortunate enough to have been in the stall next to this guy during what could only be described as a religious experience. Imagine a 5 gallon bucket full of pennies being dumped into the toilet from standing height. This guy didn\'t need to see an exorcist, he was the exorcist. Excising all his demons into his chosen shit-demon vessel, the handicapped stall.\n\nThe thing about a penny dump though is that its violent. He left every stall like a crime scene Gil Grissom would have to spend hours analyzing shit splatter patterns at. It was always on the toilet seat, both sides, the back of the toilet, the base, just the whole toilet at any given time. Which meant it was definitely on this guys ass, hands, every surface his ass-hands touched, and above all our innocence. \n\nSo you can imagine how relieve we were when one manager sent an email to every man in the company warning that we do have security cam footage of everyone who entered the bathroom, and could easily find the guy thats leaving the stalls in ""less than serviceable condition"" if it came to it. It didn\'t last though, cuz seemingly in retaliation penny dude fucked up both stalls later that week.

Tried to flush the toilet and the thing was like:  ""Nah.""  Poured orange solvent cleaner on it, let it sit to dissolve.

"'Used to work in an office that shared a hallway and restroom with the Japanese embassy. We knew it was the embassy workers trashing the bathrooms for two reasons:\n\n1. We were a startup and generally rolled into work around 9:30 at the earliest, but the toilets were always trashed on our arrival.\n2. Those Japanese dudes would very politely walk into the bathroom, bid you good morning, enter the stall, then TRANSFORM INTO SHRIEKING SHIT BANSHEES. They\'d yell sharp, quick, piercing cries. They\'d grunt like mating razorbacks. They\'d stomp their feet and pound the walls. It was as if they thought the paper thin partitions were an impenetrable barrier to sound and pain. They would emerge once more and shapeshift back into mild-mannered embassy workers, but the smells and the mess were unimpeachable evidence of their misdeeds.\n\nOne day, just before quitting time, my coworker ran into the office and motioned wildly for me to follow him. Into the bathroom. There was no debating him on this, because his eyes spoke of something wonderful and terrifying.\n\nOnce inside, he prodded open the middle stall and held the door wide. ""Riddle me \\*that\\*,"" he said, his voice a mixture of pride and amazement. At first I didn\'t understand, but then my own eyes widened in wonder. There, lodged impossibly high under the rear rim of the toilet, was a perfect ball of shit. Literally \\*attached\\* to the underside of the rim. Tiny brown splatters along the rear of the bowl attested to the force with which the ball had been deposited there.\n\nWe stood for a moment in silent contemplation, trying to understand the mechanics of this thing.\n\n""D\'ya think he skipped it off the surface, or fired it in there from a distance then wiped down the rim?""\n\n""I... I have no clue. But there\'s no earthly way he could hit that angle with the seat down."" I said, still in shock.\n\nIndeed, it looked as though the ball had been thrown \\*up\\*, from below, at tremendous speed. It was so high up, in fact, that it was immune to flushing.\n\nWe called the building management and the janitor, when he surveyed the scene, muttered, ""I\'ll be happy when that embassy moves.""\n\nTen years later, we still talk on the phone about that turd and wonder how it ever got there, and what elements of Japanese culture account for what that bathroom went through.'",912ubx

Maybe this sugar pine was just plain old and wouldn't even live another 10 years, so better to utilize it's resources vs letting it collapse to the ground and let it become fuel for a wild fire? There's so many variables that go into cutting that one tree it really is mind boggling. Everyone should be an advocate for responsibly harvested timber products, even if it's in your own backyard, even say it's a big beauty of a tree, even if getting the road to it and dragging it out creates some short term disturbance(not damage) to the landscape. It's tough but for every plastic product we can probably create either a corn or wood based product to replace it. For fucks sake we erect plastic telephone polls. It's a damn tree without the limbs!! Plastic spools for thread, plastic toothbrushes, mechanical pencils, grocery bags. If we just fully converted those 4 products how much waste could save annually? If we can move our society away from plastics the world would benefit so much. Is there a floating island of shitty driftwood in the Pacific, at least one that will never breakdown?

KC has one of the finest jazz traditions in the world, but out of that was also born one of the most sprawling and diverse burlesque and drag traditions which has held to this day. We've got traditional vaudeville burlesque, club burlesque, glitter burlesque, sing-and-strip, comedy, movie homage, BBW burlesque, all-black troupes, burlympics, boy-lesque, and so much more. It's a wonderful scene, highly cooperative, and brings so much empowerment to the women who join, run and direct these troupes.\n\nAs far as drag, you've got your essential club drag and ball drag, but also comedy drag (Hamburger Mary's is such joy), theatre drag, K&Q drag, and pageant drag.\n\nThis is like an everyday thing here, too. Eight days ago I watched two local performers perform a two-woman burlesque act as lovers Sarah Connor and the T-800, right before watching a woman with an incredibly detailed Fester Adams and Thing costume do naughty things with light bulbs and a toaster. It's funny, it's sexy, and you're encouraged to cheer, stomp, and shout throughout.\n\nHope to see you all in my city soon!""",8hq1gt

The transitional stage is exemplified in Chaucer\'s Doctor of phesike (Latin physica came to be used extensively in Medieval Latin for medicina). Similar usage of the equivalent of doctor is colloquial in most European languages: Italian dottore, French docteur, German doktor, Lithuanian daktaras, though these are typically not the main word in those languages for a medical healer. For similar evolution, see Sanskrit vaidya- ""medical doctor,"" literally ""one versed in science.""

This went on every night for about a week.\n\nNext thing I know the owl is trying to live in the tree on the edge of my yard. In the states laws keep you from owning owls, but if one makes a home on your property it is like a loophole of sorts. So I built him a basic hutch and put it in a good spot in his chosen tree, next thing I know is he has moved in.\n\nThis was the best option honestly, he stayed in that tree for years, got comfortable with me being around, I got to see him hunt and hang out most days/nights...

While talking, using the wireless connection to her daughters cerebral implant, she increases the dosage of Allison's antidepressant medication. \n\nMadison turns on the laptop, navigates the desktop to the file manager to an old file inside the documents folder. It is her old half completed school work from 30 years before. She gazes in amazement at this old relic of a computer and marvels at what has transpired over the years in computer technology. \n\nAs she sits quietly in her own thoughts, Steve arrives home with a present for their daughter.

Just as Allison gets ready for bed, Steve places some tiny wireless nodes on her daughters forehead explaining to her that the system has to calibrate itself to the person's brain waves. As Madison watches from the doorway, Steve turns on the device. Allison hums a tune and gently falls asleep.

Unless you are an animated princess these are not your friend.\n\nC) Chipmunks are INCREDIBLY skittish creatures. This chipmunk almost certainly regularly interacts with or even lives with that cat. Especially in the awkward face to face moment on the edge of the window well there it definitely is not as scared as a wild chipmunk should or would be.\n\nD) That cat is not murdering anything. Again, the early staredown they have pretty much conclusively demonstrates some familiarity or bond with the chipmunk. \n\nE) That\'s what chipmunk tails look like a lot of the time.\n\nI could be wrong, maybe the chipmunk is a baby and used to have an extra long tail that got ripped to normal size, maybe the cat has been abusing it for hours so its too tired to panic or run.

He\'d often think about the family he had left behind but tried not to linger on those thoughts. The pain made the chase harder. The man eventually became too old and too fragile to run any more but he did his best to keep up with those passing doors. Then one day he went to that train station, like he always did, but just as he was ready to start running he saw the train just sitting there. Doors wide open. He approached it carfully at first, like a cat sneaking up on a mouse. As he got closer, he braced himself to start running after it again. Still, the train doesn\'t move. Closer and closer he got to that train. Then before he knew it, he was on. The man skipped and danced with happiness, he had only felt this joy once before. The train\'s doors close and the man doesn\'t have to run anymore. Where would it take him he wondered. The man had been chased that train for so long he had forgotten why he was chasing it in the first place. It didn\'t matter. He was on the train now. After some distance the train stopped and its doors opened wide. This was his stop. Didn\'t know how. He just knew. He walked off that train with a hop to his step. As he stood on this new and unfamiliar platform a woman in the crowd caught his eye. It couldn\'t be? Could it? The man approached the woman as she began to turn around. It was. It was his ex-wife. The woman he let get away because he was too damn proud and foolish to let that train go. Even after all of these years she was as beautiful as the day they had met. How he had missed her. The woman\'s gaze lock with his as the man continued to stare shocked with tear filled eyes. \n""It\'s ok"", she said. ""This platform is a place for new beginnings"". \n""And our daughter? Is she here too?"" The man asked. \nThe woman giggled, ""No, dear. She\'s not here. She\'ll arrive when it\'s her time. Just like we did.

"'I\'ve never been a firefighter but my country has mandatory conscription and I had to do something similar in the military. Every once in a while our squad had to be part of something called ""5-min response team"". Basically we were the first responders in case some terrorist or spy attacked our base or something. We had to run out like those firefighters whenever the big bell in our room rang.\n\nOf course that\'s nothing compared to actual firefighters because the truth is my country is rather quite peaceful and no sane person attacks a military base. I was never put in a life-or-death situation. It was just mostly drills. Still that was a very stressful experience because you never knew when the higher-ups are going to press the button to ""test your readiness."" Sometimes a crazy officer would press the button in the middle of the night. Like, seriously? You\'re not even going to let us sleep in peace?\n\nThe surprising thing about human beings is that adrenaline still kicks in 1 AM in the morning. You wake up in an instant and somehow manage to get down in under 5 minutes. Then after the rush is over, you notice a bruise on your shin and remember you ran into the metal frame of your bed while trying to get dressed in a frenzy. That shit turns purple and hurts for days.\n\nSo I have nothing but respect to all those firefighters in the world who have to deal with something like that all the time. I only did it for 2 weeks at a time. For firefighters it\'s their whole career. All that anxiety and adrenaline can\'t be good for your health. I also know that in many countries firefighters are often understaffed and sleep-deprived. I really think firefighters should be the highest-paying jobs instead of bankers and lawyers.'",8xyv4r

Look at how fast they respond. Look at what they‚Äôre willing to run into.

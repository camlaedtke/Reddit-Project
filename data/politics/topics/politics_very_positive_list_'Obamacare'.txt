McCain is getting the credit, but these women are the ones who really saved Obamacare
'i would add that the entire democratic senate also played a small roll...the media in this country is absolutely crazy.\n\nThe entire republican party spends 8 years trying to take health care away from people, and then one old guy gets the credit for "saving" it?\n\nClean off your eyes folks, the dominant narrative is suspect.'
"It's 'shitting the bed' syndrome.\n\nYou don't shit the bed 10 times in a row, noone cares or pats you on that back\n\nyou shit the bed 9 times in a row, the 1 time you don't everyone's there to congratulate you."
"Stupid article. Everyone who voted against it saved the ACA. However, the 3 Republicans voted against party lines so they're in the spotlight. Further than that McCain looked pretty sure he would vote for the bill then didn't. That's why he is in the news."
'Murkowski and Collins certainly deserve more credit. But I know I derive a ton of pleasure from McCain being in the "NO" column. He was praised just the other day by Trump for his "heroic" return to the senate. I can\'t wait to watch the GOP eat each other as the blame game takes hold. Maybe it\'s time for Mitch to go... '
'Well, in Washington they say - that John’s small heart grew three sizes that day. And then - the true meaning of compassion came through, and John found the strength of *ten* Johns, plus two!'
"I see no reason to believe McCain was bucking his party. It's just as likely that Republicans didn't want to pass anything. Now McCain is getting rave reviews and the GOP can go to their base and say they did what they could and pin their failure on McCain, who is unliked by the conservative base and is almost dead anyway.\n\nRepublicans put on big performances like this all the time, it allows them to control the media narratives and appeal to moderates. I don't think McCain was voting to save healthcare for people so much as he was voting to help the Republican Party save face. I see no reason to give him the benefit of the doubt. "
"To further add to Lisa Murkowski's badassery, she successfully won her senate seat in 2010 on a write in campaign after the republican party voted for someone else in the primary. "
"It cost McCain, who is not running for Senate again,nothing to cast this vote. \n\nIt cost Susan Collins almost nothing to cast this vote. Maine may be conservative but it's not crazy alt-right. \n\nThis vote cost Lisa Murkowski a lot. She was singled out and attacked by Trump in the press and on Twitter. The various thugs that are toadies for Trump came after her with flame throwers and jackhammers. She stood up. She took it. She voted her values and in what she considered to be the best interest of the country. \n\nShe didn't fold like Johnson or Graham or all the other men who promised to oppose the bill. \n\nCall Murkowski's senate office and thank her. \n\nShe deserves a pat on the back"
'Also the entire Democratic party. Can they get credit for anything? Ever?'
'Not a McCain fan or a republican, but here are some interesting info on these two women:\n“Neither senator should be mistaken for a progressive hero. Both voted against Obama’s original healthcare legislation…” https://gu.com/p/6qpcd/stw'
"I don't disagree with the general point of this article, but it's not a zero sum game. Good on all three of them in this case. "
'Give all three of them credit, but McCain is the surprise. Go on all three of their websites today and thank them- especially if a senator from your state voted for this skinny bill.\n\nRegardless of where you are on the spectrum, we need to craft good thoughtful pieces of legislation and this was not it. Chalk this one up as a win for representative democracy.\n\nEdit- word r hard to spel'
'Actually Democrats saved Obamacare. That whole party (The GOP) is garbage.'
"Don't all 3 Republicans deserve credit? As well as every Democratic senator?"
"Let's give credit where credit is due.  Everyone who voted against the repeal saved Obamacare, not just a few people who finally decided not to toe the party-line."
"[Serious] Can someone please explain to me what exactly is wrong with the ACA that makes Republicans want to repeal it other than the fact that it was passed under the leadership of a black Democrat? \n\nThis ACA is without a doubt helping people and keeping millions of Americans healthy, or at least cared for, without the financial burden. So what's the problem? "
'what I wrote to Senator Collins: \n\nThankyou Senator Collins for standing up against a terrifyingly incomplete health care bill. The United States now desperately you and your colleagues to reach across the aisle. Health care will take time to solve. You have common issues that are needed to be addresed such as drug prices gouging. Develop solutions to addres those issues and the american people will continue to grow and thrive. Personally I support a public option to create consistent availability and the government leverage to negotiate and keep healthcare costs lower. \n\nThankyou'
'All three deserve credit, but Collins is safe and McCain is terminally ill. Murkowski may have torched her career last night and saved hundreds of thousands of lives in the process. '
'While I would like to thank him for his reasoned, responsible vote, only his unreasonable, unconscionable vote allowed this vote to be reached in the first place.'
'Pretty crazy that voting to not murder millions of people makes you a hero now.'
"Yes, but we pretty much already knew Murkowski and Collins would vote against it. McCain's sudden defection is the noteworthy one. Murkowski and Collins tied up the vote and made the assist to allow McCain to score on this one, so they do deserve as much credit for the bill's death."
'"Obamacare," love it or hate it, was a very important first step towards efficient health care for all.  It\'s not a perfect system, but so many people use it, that it cant just be repealed.  Too many people rely on it now, so it is forcing something BETTER to come along, even though it hasn\'t yet.  Thank goodness there\'s something in place for people in need right now, regardless of pre-existing conditions.'
'A lot of activists on twitter are saying things like "congrats, your calls to your senators are what made this happen." Honest question, is that true? Seems like Collins and Murkowski were voting no the whole time, and McCain voted no bc the bill is a joke. Otherwise, total party line vote. Am I missing something?'
"Well, in Washington they say - that the McCain's small heart grew three sizes that day. And then - the true meaning of healthcare came through, and the McCain found the strength of *ten* McCains, plus two"
'How about this: the activist constituencies of Maine and Alaska should get the credit for this, as well as the rest of the grassroots surge across the country to save Obamacare.'
"Thug. Does he know any Alaskans? They don't take shit like this.  They elected Lisa Murkowski over a tea party thug on a WRITE IN vote, first time in the modern era for a senate race. Her father was a beloved governor. She is well liked by Alaska's oil industry and Native communities and majority republicans. You do not come after Lisa Murkowski or Alaska, you pencil-dicked vulgarian."
'What are you gonna do Trump cultists? You have to follow daddy Trump wherever he may lead, but Alaska is the home of the big strong grizzly mountain men you like to watch on the Discovery channel. What a dilemma. '
'>"I\'m not going to go into the details, but I fear that the strong economic growth, pro-energy, pro-mining, pro-jobs and personnel from Alaska who are part of those policies are going to stop," Senator Sullivan said.\n\nThis seems like a lot of bark and no bite - drilling and mining are the two things Trump loves more than anything.'
'> Senator @lisamurkowski of the Great State of Alaska really let the **Republicans**, and our **country**, down yesterday. Too bad!\n\nKind of telling that he puts emphasis on party over country.'
"I'm sure Canada wouldn't mind annexing Alaska. Alaska and Canada already share so many interests! Like the cold, snow, being as far away from Trump as possible..."
'Do it Trump, alienate a conservative state, I dare you.\n\nyou should alienate the citizens of Maine too.  The people of those states will only love you more if you treat them like shit.'
'What I find so intriguing about this incident is not the threat itself: it\'s that apparently, the Secretary of the Interior called *both* Alaskan senators, despite only Murkowski voting against the bill. And in fact, it was *Sullivan* who went to the press, angry about it.\n\nAlso interesting: this same Department of the Interior is what Murkowski is in charge of staffing with nominations. \n\n>Murkowski chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and has used the position to drive home Alaska priorities, particularly with Interior nominees. She oversees the confirmation process for the Interior Department.\n\nSo it\'s essentially a funny position where Trump tells his underling to threaten the very person that is their boss in the Senate. Crazy.\n\nAlso of note: the "isolation" mentioned seems to be specifically denying help for energy issues. [Source](https://www.adn.com/politics/2017/07/26/trump-administration-signals-that-murkowskis-health-care-vote-could-have-energy-repercussions-for-alaska/):\n\n> Efforts and issues on the line include nominations of Alaskans to Interior posts, an effort to build a road out of King Cove through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, and future opportunities to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and expand drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, among other regulatory issues that are a priority for Murkowski and Sullivan.\n\nedit: grammar'
"MASTER PLAN ALL ALONG. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nPutin in 2016 was all like 'Mr. Trump we would like Alaska territory back here have a hacked election victory.' \n\n&nbsp; \n\nTrump was all like 'I'll make such a shitshow of everything that my own party will be backstabbing each other and the Senate GOP will be divided and I'll get the Alaska Senator to vote no and I'll isolate them and you can swoop in and take Alaska back. Bigly.'\n\n&nbsp; \n\nPutin was all like 'Thanks. By the way, we've still got that kompromat so I think we might want Washinton and Oregon too.' \n\n&nbsp; \n\nTrump: 'Let me check with Kushner about whether I have hotels there first.'"
'"The Great Uniter", everybody.'
'A few days ago I saw someone joking about Trump giving Russia Alaska. Just like with Trump, things we joked about in the past are coming true.'
"Not sure if been said already but I don't think Trump knows anything about Alaska. We are home to a lot of the nation's military defense infastructure. Being near the artic circle we are the closest to every other major nation with a quick air ride. I'm not saying we have the most air ships but we have an entire military base that is devoted to nuclear defense in the middle of our state. Alaska is a key part of the US's defense network and our commander and chief probably doesn't know a thing about it. "
"Really mature there, Donald. So proud you're our president."
"Alaska should secede and join Canada. They'd be better off anyway. "
"So ... is he going to sell Alaska back to Russia for 11 million dollars - that's like a 50% profit! ART OF THE DEAL!"
'I would have loved to sit in on any job interview she has had with The Blaze or Fox or whatever rag shes worked for. \n\n"Hi, Tammy. Thanks for coming in."\n\n"It\'s Tomi."\n\n"Whatever.

Anyway, here\'s what we have in mind for your role here; We would like you to act as a mouthpiece for our babble while simultaneously representing an unattainable sexual attraction for basement dwelling neckbeard edgelords in their late 20s/early 30s who have never known the company of a woman due to their intentionally false autistic behavior, as well as smooth brained white male boomers who are essentially the aged amalgamation of the formally mentioned group."\n\n"That\'s oddly specific.

'>“Luckily, I am 24, so I am still on my parents’ plan,” Lahren said during the debate, drawing boos from the crowd, according to The Daily Beast.\n\n>Handler defended Lahren for the comment. \n"Stop, she is being honest," Handler said, Variety reported.\n\nFuck that.  She deserves to be booed for that.  I don\'t care if she\'s "being honest" or not; she\'s being incredibly hypocritical for railing against the ACA while taking full advantage of it.\n\nThe whole "she\'s being honest" thing is just another instance of "I like Trump because he tells it like it is!" that got us into the mess we\'re in right now.  So, sure, she was being honest in as much as she told the truth that she\'s using the ACA while trying to convince everyone to dismantle it, but telling the truth is simply what you\'re supposed to do.  Doing it shouldn\'t act as a shield for all the other shitty things you do.'
'[As with Eric Cantor](https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/07/26/eric-cantor-republicans-obamacare-donald-trump/) earlier in the week, now that the repeal effort has failed, Republicans are going to have to get honest about how much they\'ve been lying for six, seven years.\n\nI still say if you just rename the Affordable Care Act the Liberty Freedom Health Act to Help Military First Responders and Police Dogs, and changed nothing else, "conservative" voters would love it. The GOP was that effective at demonizing Obama and his involvement.'

"I'm a conservative and pro Obamacare.  I like keeping my kids on my insurance.  It saves them money and helps them launch.  One is going to graduate school and health insurance is one less thing he has to worry about.  My own arthritis will be a pre-existing condition for the rest of my life and it's good to know my Remicade will be covered if I have to change insurance.  With a little luck I may not have to work until 65 - without preexistng condition coverage, early retirement would be impossible for guys like me.  Are there things we could do to bring down prices?  Sure - where is that interstate insurance we keep hearing about?  Fuck Paul Ryan and all the RINOs.  "
"Since all you people are for Obamacare, wouldn't you prefer single payer? Would you keep Obamacare the way it is? It seems the GOP highjacked the entire conversation to keep the left from talking about universal health care. I think Obamacare was a mistake, something needed to be done, but this was just a bandaid. People's cost are going up and co-ops have failed. \n\nI'm a vet, so I have a form of single payer, but we have our own problems. For those who have never experienced the VA, head down to your busiest DMV without an appointment and half your paperwork. It's kind of like that, but more often, more intrusive and with fewer results. So universal health care done wrong can be hell too and it's not like this country is great at keeping up infrastructure. \n\nI wonder what the debate would look like if the DNC wouldn't have fucked over Sanders and what his proposal for fixing Obamacare would look like. \n\n"
"> after she was forced out of Glenn Beck’s libertarian media outlet The Blaze after comments she made in favor of abortion access.\n\n... I don't care if a cosmic asshole like Beck calls it libertarian, being anti-abortion-access is among the least libertarian policies ever. Modern Libertarians have a lot of trouble comprehending the economy, but on social issues like this it's pretty clear-cut: do the one that isn't curtailing the rights of conscious humans."

"For conservatives, their opposition to Obamacare has little to do with what is good for the country or for Americans and everything to do with the politics of power. It's a wedge issue they exploit to whip up votes for a shrinking party and ideology."
"She's a 24-year-old? Why should anybody care about her thoughts on this topic?! Not to offend people in their early twenties, but that's barely out of high school. One's life experience at that age is so thin, especially in the area of healthcare, as to make their opinions less than weighty, at least on the national stage. I'm not saying that younger people shouldn't be involved in the discussion, but why would someone like her deserve a voice on the national stage?"
"That's honestly hilarious.\n\nThat's why I like Obamacare. Currently looking for a job after graduation, and health insurance is one thing I don't need to worry about."
'I\'m almost certain that she is in these "elite GOP circles" because she\'s a pretty face.'
'After which she\'ll marry some rich guy in his 50s, and never have to worry about paying for anything.  You know...the "American Dream" that\'s available to everyone!  Bootstrappy!'
"Let's remember that on the campaign trail, Trump promised over and over again that he would replace obamacare with something better and cheaper that would insure everyone. Assuming they believed him, they weren't necessarily voting to repeal obamacare, they were voting for better, cheaper health care. It's a promise that he never intended to keep, but they completely dropped the pretense of replacing it with a superior product, and the unknown quantity of people in those states who voted for something better are having the rug pulled from under them while being told that it's what they wanted."
"As someone who is a big fan of Obamacare, this statistic is really misleading. As far as I can tell, they are only looking at enrollees on federally-run exchanges, not those run by the states. (Note that California isn't listed as one of the top states, even though it has a huge number of enrollees.) \n\nThe program was intended for State governments to run the exchanges, but for the most part only blue states actually chose to do so (because Republican governors and legislatures were being babies about doing anything to help Obama.) So it shouldn't be surprising that the states that we're politically opposed to Obamacare are also those that predominantly went for Trump. \n\nEdit: To add some numbers it looks like the real number is 7,761,594 enrollees in Trump states, which is 63.5% of the total 12,216,003.  [Source](www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/total-marketplace-enrollment). Those states have a total population that makes up 56.6% of the U.S. population. So Trump states do have disproportionately more enrollees, but not to the extreme the article suggests. Also, as other commenters have mentioned, the differences between Trump and Hillary states in adoption of the medicaid expansion probably would account for most of the ~7% gap in expected enrollment that these numbers show. "
'We have some friends who fall into this category. They use Obamacare and voted for Trump hoping he would help reduce their premiums. I wonder how that’s working out for them. '
"They didn't enroll in Obamacare, they enrolled in The Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhile I know that isn't a different thing. They clearly don't."
"And people definitely sign up for Obamacare because they love it, not because they face a fine of thousands of dollars if they don't."
'Amazing isnt it? I lived in KS with my parents until last year. They hated obama care and were always talking non stop about how their coverage was so much worse and so much more expensive since they were forced to switch. I moved to colorado, switched my insurance to the Cobamacare and theyre amazed at how good and cheap my insurance is. Yeah, you dont hate Obamacare, you hate what the republicans did to it.'
'These are the folks that hate Obamacare but love the ACA. Fucking morons.. '
"Its almost like people don't like being forced to buy things they don't need."
"Red States don't have Obamacare. They have the ACA, which is better and not under threat. /s"
"I wish someone would explain why we are giving money to insurance companies instead of the doctors and nurses who actually provide healthcare. \n\nEveryone seems to think health insurance and healthcare are the same thing. In reality, health insurance is run by bankers and salesmen who don't give two shits about the health and welfare of Americans. \n\nInsurance companies are bound by law to do everything they possibly can to deny people health care, since that is the way they make profit for their share holders. I still don't understand how so many people, especially the democrats, are OK with propping up a system that is designed to place bets and gamble on peoples health."

">“There’s politics, and then there’s taking care of yourself and your family,” said analyst Chris Sloan of the consulting firm Avalere Health. “You can have political views about a program like the Affordable Care Act, but when you get an opportunity to get subsidized health insurance for you and your family … politics is a distant consideration.”\n\nThat doesn't even make any sense."

"Worth noting only about 55 percent of eligible voters actually voted in 2016. Also in the states that Trump won a ton of people still voted for Hillary.

">On the first day of enrollment alone, Nov. 1, one source close to the process told The Hill that more than 200,000 people selected a plan for 2018, compared to around 100,000 last year. More than 1 million people visited healthcare.gov that day, compared to around 750,000 last year, the source said.\n\nDouble the number of people on the first day. That's encouraging. The polls that showed a renewed popularity for the law under Trump weren't crazy after all."
"I don't know about others, but my premiums for the exact same plan this year went up 100 bucks a month. So I'm happy it's still around, but Trump has been effective in fucking over Obamacare and the people that rely on it still."
"People NEED medical care and without coverage, you're basically gambling with bankruptcy and decades of financial misery should something catastrophic happen. In my area, the only insurance you can buy is through the marketplace unless you have an employer who provides health insurance benefits. So, it's either the marketplace, or nothing. The premiums are way up this year, but since my wife was laid off, my family has finally qualified for the subsidy. It is a HUGE help. I got a silver plan for $765/mo for a family of 4 with a $1k deductible per person ($2k/family) which is much, much better than what I'm currently covered for. This year, we were paying ~$900/mo for a plan that has a $6k deductible individual and $14,500 family. Without the subsidy though, the plan I signed up for is $1,750/mo. It's a backbreaker for those families that don't qualify for subsidies."
' Wish I could afford Obama care. Must be nice'
"I don't think it's because the ACA is affordable, or popular, because it's neither, and the rates just went up 30% again. The reality is that employers are increasingly shifting the burden of health insurance to individuals by keeping people at 32 hours a week or less. \n\nI know that as a small employer, even though I'm not required to, I offered health care to my employees. But after the ACA was passed prices started skyrocketing and I couldn't afford it. So instead I provided $ each month, and they're on their own with the ACA, as am I. \n\nWhen the ACA started, I was paying about $1200 a month for myself, my wife, two kids, and two employees. We all had good health insurance, with a $300 out of pocket and $1000 deductible. \n\nThen is was $1500. Then we all split off. Kids at 18 went to the exchange on their own. Last year my wife and I had a plan for $950, with a $3000 out of pocket each and a $5700 deductible. Next year that plan is $1410, although subsidies will increase, so I'll only be paying about $100 a month more. But the insurance companies will get another $460 a month for two people. \n\nWithout a subsidy I couldn't afford it at all. But when I look at the numbers, the ACA is better for insurance companies than it is for those of us using it. So the increase in use isn't because it's good, it's because we don't have a choice. "
'Just a PSA if you’re looking to sign up, I highly recommend speaking with an insurance broker. Most major and small companies know how to set people up with ACA insurance. It’s so much easier than trying to use the website. \n\nWhen I first signed up, I did it over the phone and it took less than 30 minutes. Every time I renew I call the same company and end up speaking to someone else because turnover rate is high, whatever. It takes like 10 minutes or less to renew. \n\nThe website can be overwhelming and often glitchy and slow during open enrollment. '
"I just got my plan. Yeah it's not perfect but it's cheaper than I was quoted at or expecting due to tax credit, and saves me money in comparison to what I was paying when I was seeing the doctor with no insurance.  Thanks Obama. \n\nE: disclaimer, I'm a dummy when it comes to the nuances of health insurance. Just saying that in my case it worked out for me. We obviously have a long way to go. I hope everyone finds something that works for them, good luck guys. "

'I love the ACA! Please sign up. Please keep it alive. Please help us all. '
"You can thank people like me who don't get subsidies for your cheap health care.  I support the ACA but just realize that some of us are getting shafted.  "
"It's good to see that not every ploy of the Republican party to quash the ACA is working."
"Sure that's great and all. But if you like a GOP run state like I do, they've deliberately sabotaged Obamacare. There is ONE provider this year and it's terrible and unaffordable. I tried to just buy insurance on the open market and it's basically impossible. So, guess we're paying out of pocket now. I just hope we stay healthy."
"It's TrumpCare now folks. Whether the law succeeds or fails, guess who owns it? For the people who do not want to give any credit to Donald Trump, let's not forget that it's better to give a fool his plaything and save millions of lives than (by forcing him to improve a healthcare system that bears his name) take the plaything away and risk lives of millions."

Now she works at a full-time, paper pushing job and she is on their own healthcare system.\n\nIt sucks. And she can only afford general healthcare and not dental or vision. She might, next year at least, go back on Obamacare cause it just is a better system.\n\nMy sister is hardly political and my parents are (mostly sane) Conservatives. They are slowly, but surely, realizing how dire this repeal process has been but it still hasn't clicked just yet."
'Must be a great deal ....'
"What is the cheapest plan you can get under Obamacare? I dont have any healthcare but luckily I'm young haha. I've honestly been too intimidated to research"
'I\'d love to sign up, but my monthly cost on the most basic plan I could find (so basic that only one doctor accepted it, and had a three month waiting list) went up from an already crazy $360 to about $480 per month. Hopefully this surge puts prices down in the "actually affordable" range.'

I’ve never had that happen in the 20\xa0years that I’ve been privileged to serve in the Senate. So it was very encouraging and affirming, especially after arriving back home after a very difficult time,”\xa0  \n\n'
'As an independent voter I traditionally vote for the individual that will be the best in office regardless of party affiliation. I would be proud if this was the republican senator that i helped vote into office in 2016. Unfortunately I do not live in Maine.'
'Off topic: I remember being greeted by a crowd of cheering people when I landed in Bangor Maine after deployment for desert storm. Those were some great Americans. '
'As usual, the real hero is a woman who had to watch a guy get the credit because he was more dramatic.\n\nSen. Collins, just like Pepperidge Farms, we remember.'
"I'm a conservative and I would love to see a repeal and replace of obamacare, but Collins gets a pass from me because she co-wrote an excellent piece of healthcare legislation, the Patient Freedom act, which never gained traction. If you propose a solution and you put the time and effort in and your efforts are squashed by foolish partisanship and technicalities, in my opinion you can vote however the fuck you want on heealthcare. "
'Glad to see a woman supported. Watching the sea of white men voting for repeal is fucking sickening.'

'Thanks for not voting to kill us, oh dear and merciful ruler. Your kindness knows no bounds.'
'/clap Thanks goodness! That bill was appalling!'
'Love Susan Collins! Country before Party!!'
'I just enjoyed watching her and seeing senetor Collins have her guard down for a sec she sounded like a gma'
"I appreciate your applause, but I don't do it for applause. I do it for cash... it's much better.\n\n-Eddie Izzard"
'i love it'
'Eventually the rich will win and get their tax cut, they always do.'
"I will be the first to admit, being a proud Canadian, that I don't have a full grasp on how the American healthcare system works. But what is the argument AGAINST single payer / universal healthcare? Why WOULDN'T you want to pay less for more coverage? I just don't understand it at all, its like an abstract thing in my mind. I've never had to worry about healthcare costs in my entire life. I've never even thought about it unless I'm comparing the system to other countries'. Health isn't a product that you let the free market establish. It should be treated like law enforcement services, governmental services, emergency services, etc. \n\nSometimes I've heard that a system like that wouldn't work in the US.... dismissing it before it's even tried. And I don't get how voters treat it as a republican vs democrat issue. If you're a republican without universal/single payer the first question they'll ask you when you leave the hospital is if you have coverage, not who you vote for. Makes me angry thinking about how many people have been duped to the point where it's irreversible. These voters think they're voting for what they think their party stands for (really they're just parroted themes at this point) and those representatives turn around and con them. "
"I'm glad to hear all about how you help people they like you more."
'"While I support many of the components of this plan, this approach will not provide the market stability and premium relief that is needed," she said in a statement on Thursday, encouraging a bipartisan approach. " \n\nthis is why? .... no this does not deserve applause'
'Nobody cares about Collins. Credit goes to McCain. Lol at politics trying to control the narrative. '
"I'm with those who say let the free market have it. No, it wasn't perfect before the government hijacked it, but it wasn't THIS bad! If you want a socialist Utopia, then go over to Argentina and get some! They're having a GREAT time!"
'surely a group of people at the airport is a good representation of the constituency. /s\n\nmaybe they should take a poll instead, seeing how she literally got elected by campaigning on repealing obamacare. \n\nedit: lol at the downvotes, stay triggered'
'Yes, but one Ayn Rand loving Billionaire is worth 9,587,381 little people (give or take a few).'
"There's been a lot of talk about who really deserves the praise for saving the ACA, and I think McCain does deserve some credit, but the bulk of the credit has to go to the type of people who are out their applauding her.  Those are the people who blew up their reps' phones, emails, social media, and townhalls demanding an end to the repeal process, and those are the people that convinced Collins and Murkowski to vote against these bills."
"Guess he doesn't own any insurance stocks. I hope someone is watching the actions of his family and associates to see if they had advance notice of this and are profiting from it."
'How did I use to support this guy. Glad I had a small stroke and woke up.'
'Just great. These plunging stocks will massively increase the national debt!\n\n/s'
'"Obama Care is collapsing!"\n\n*20 million people buy Obama Care*\n\n"I **said**... it\'s...**collapsing**."\n\n*Executive order to shoot Obama Care in the spine*\n\n"See?  It\'s collapsing!"'
'That’s great. Millions of jobs at risk. Millions of retirement accounts losing value. Great job sir! '
'Well the moment he signed the executive order it became Trump care so....'
"Fun Fact: Obamacare increased Health Insurance profits by 15%. It allowed regional monopolies to form legally. It was never meant to work, it was written to collapse and push America into a single payer system. It's obvious to anyone who read the ACA. "
'IMO this is one of three things:\n\n1.  He really has no idea what\'s going on, or what to do next, and is just trying to appeal to conservatives with, "See!?  I killed Obamacare!  Do more of you like me now better?  ....pretty please?  LIKE ME!!"  (probably most likely)\n\n2.  Actively working with McConnell behind the scenes to force reluctant GOP Senators to get on board with whatever shady back-room shit they come up with now.  (very possible)\n\n3.  Trump is now going to complete his werewolf-like transformation into the second coming of Richard Nixon and **start negotiating with Democrats around some form of single-payer.**  (Though this is, by far, the *least* likely, it is actually the most frightening in the long-term.)\n\nThe main reason I even mention #3 is that Trump\'s ego *has* to be absolutely *fiending* for praise and adoration.  As in, shriveled in a corner in the fetal position, shaking uncontrollably in need of positive attention.\n\n He really *doesn\'t give a fuck* where it comes from.  I think it means more to him than money... which would make sense, because he couldn\'t possibly understand the actual value of money... he\'s never lived without it.\n\nA lot of people might say, "Hey, if it gets single-payer done, I\'m for it."  Which would be fine if everything was only about healthcare.  But it isn\'t.  North Korea & Iran won\'t magically disappear.  Millions of Americans won\'t suddenly *stop* living in fear of persecution or deportation.  He\'s not going to raise taxes on the rich.  Or work for student debt forgiveness.  Or increase funding for public education.  He\'ll still be the same addle-brained bigot he\'s always been, and he\'ll still be the commander-in-chief of the most powerful military arsenal in the history of mankind.'

"The inevitable approach of death has a way of directing one's perspective towards lasting principles rather than fleeting self interest.  It's just a shame that this doesn't happen for more people earlier in their lives."
'Dammit McCain why did it take cancer for you to start doing the right thing?! '
'Fuck McCain. You can’t rehabilitate your shit image just because you’re dying of cancer. You made your bed and now you have to lie in it and history will remember you for the evil you helped usher into the world. Burn in Hell.'
"Cue various Right-Wing talking heads arguing that McCain's brain cancer has destroyed his mind. Guaran-fucking-teed."
"McCain needs to step down. No offense, but the man with the brain tumor probably isn't the most mentally stable..."
"I've talked a lot of shit about McCain for talking big but never following through, but he's been consistently making an ass out of me lately. I don't agree with him on everything, but I respect him more than most politicians (from either side)."
'Looming death seems to have made a real public servant out of him.'
'Cue the McCain death threats'
'It will go 5-4 per the party of the president that appointed the justice, mark my words.\n\nI don\'t even care what the plaintiff and defendant arguments are, whether they\'re reasonable, etc. It\'s an obvious partisan issue, and the voting from the court will be obviously partisan. After the farce is done, the group that voted against will write an excuse as to why the federal government can\'t interfere with redistricting, called a judicial opinion. And the other group will write an excuse as to why it can and should, also calling that a judicial opinion. At the end of the day, nothing of value will have been gained.\n\nGill v. Whitford was a 5-4 ruling. What evidence exists that this ruling will be any different?\n\nYes, "partisan advantage" is worse now than it was six years ago, but it is a rare case when how bad a problem is motivates a judge. It did happen several times with regard to prison overpopulation, but I can\'t recall another case where it mattered.'
"the cynic in me still says the few Republicans jumping on the anti-gerrymandering train see the writing on the wall for 2020 and just don't want the Democrats to counter-gerrymander the country and cause the Republicans to become a near-permanent minority. \n\nThe idealist in me says we need all the allies we can get when it comes to fixing the broken shit in our government, and some of them will have to come from the Republican party if we ever hope to actually put an end to this bullshit. So I don't care about McCain's motives if it means he convinces more Republicans to break ranks and save this country from losing itself."

'Congress can step in and stop this madness at any time, John.'
"Um, thanks, I guess? How's about you motherfuckers up there in the goddamn majority \\**DO** something? It's almost too late, McCain. In many areas it already *is* too late. We hit bedrock a while back and now we're just being pulverized into it for about a year and a half. Did y'all's rogue rubber stamp finally embarrass you guys enough, or do you have more harsh words and brows to furrow?"
"I wish we had this version of McCain two years ago. I know he has nothing to lose now, but I wish he would have taken the gloves off the second Trump insulted his military service. The way his party has shit all over him now is infuriating. Not that its unexpected that Trump's idiot base would do this, its just hard to watch. \n\n I disagree with McCain's politics on almost every level, but he's not a soul-shriven shit-stain like most GOP politicians. "
'No you don’t. \n\nJesus, your party’s representative is ruining this country and you are doing nothing. \n\nFuck you John McCain. Get your party to impeach this piece of shit and then maybe you can say something '
"Before the brow furrowing bs starts up, a reminder:\n\n[McCain hand delivered the full Steele Dossier to the Director of the FBI.](https://www.thedailybeast.com/mccain-confirms-he-gave-trump-dossier-to-comey-duty-demanded-i-do-it). I've heard it said that the FBI had part of it earlier and would have gotten it all anyway but that's irrelevant to the question of whether or not he acted for his country. \n\n[A politician's rhetoric does matter](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/01/jeff-flake-might-be-all-talk-and-no-action-we-should-still-listen-to-what-hes-saying.html) but even beyond that there his [role in killing the effort to repeal Obamacare](https://www.newyorker.com/news/ryan-lizza/why-john-mccain-killed-obamacare-repealagain), not once [but twice] (https://www.newyorker.com/news/ryan-lizza/why-john-mccain-killed-obamacare-repealagain), and [for which Trump specifically blames him](http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/375270-trump-calls-out-mccain-for-obamacare-vote). McCain is attacked relentlessly by the right for speaking out against Trump and by the left for being the conservative that he has always been. He's not a liberal. He will never be a liberal. But this absolute vitriol directed at him is ignorant and counterproductive. "
"As a Canadian, I feel a very close bond to most American people, but the fact that this guy was elected and allowed to stay in office for this long shakes that feeling... There are so many batshit insane Americans who felt emboldened to let everyone know just how crazy they really are since this clown took over and it makes me sad seeing just how many of them there are. I hope this all gets resolved internally without a lot of bloodshed but history tells me that there's a very real, if unlikely, chance that it will get much MUCH worse before it's fixed. \n\nIf you consider yourself a conservative I beg you to take a step back and think, does the GOP and president really represent the views that make you feel like a conservative American? I find it hard to believe that it really does..."
'The US elected Trump. He ran on trade, breaking up NATO, immigration etc.He also ran a very racist and divisive campaign. He is on tape admitting to sexual assault. It was clear that he had no understanding of policy. The media loved him and gave him hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars in free advertising.\nHe is the most American President ever.\n\nAmerica does not stand with its allies. It stands with dictators, autocrats, criminals and despots. The free world will never forget how easily you went from Obama to Trump. How you attacked your own intelligence agencies and watched passively as he attacked the rule of law and descended into open corruption and criminality.\n\nIt would be ok if you kept this within your own borders.However next week you think it’s ok to send a fool to negotiate a nuclear treaty with a unstable nuclear armed regime.\n\nThe US is finished in the world. Now it is just regarded as a ‘not a serious country’ unfortunately you have a massive economy and military. The free world just has to figure out how to work around you and hopefully you won’t do to much damage over the next 7 years.'
"Beyond tired of McCain's resistance to Trump only coming in the form of worthless public comments. "
"I'm on vacation (first fucking day too) so I'm out of the loop. Wtf did he do this time? I thought he was in timeout (weekend)? "
'Donald Trump is a traitorous piece of shit. Every federal employee should go on strike until he is hung for treason.'
'Canadian here; we still stand together.  A handful of greedy assholes does not represent my neighbours.'
'I actually feel bad for McCain. He was a soldier and sacrificed much and spent his whole life with the Republican party to watch them turn evil as he dies. '
"Sure, but the President is the problem. Fix *that* or it's just meaningless words."
"I see a lot of anger vented at McCain but remember, no matter how bad you think McCain is, he's a billion times more respectable than McConnell.\n\n"
"Well, John, you choose to endorse this man after he denigrated your capture and torture, fought with Gold Star families, appeared to be compromised, and otherwise rejected everything you supposedly stood for.\n\nIt's a shame that you put that Senate seat before America, and now it's too late for mild statements of criticism."
"What the heck? The president speaks for America. If you don't like what he says, and what he says is nuts, then you had better start calling for his impeachment based on his flagrant disregard for the rule of law and for inhumane and illegal actions. Tweets are nothing!"
"No they don't, as long as you do nothing your words mean fuck all. As far as I'm concerned America is Trump now."
"No you fucking won't you lying piece of traitorous GOP scum. We, in the rest of the world, are fully aware that you sold all of America to Putin. Stop fucking pretending like everybody is blind just because you managed to make a proportion of your own population into actual mental zombies. You dont have a fucking country anymore. You have a circus. Nobody cares if the circus is standing with anybody. Get back to us when you completely destroyed the sucky insanity part that you seem reluctant to separate from."
'fucking Trump.  hes the one that fucking calls tarrifs in the first place then he turns around and blasts the others for doing so?  really?  really? Our Idiot President.  America First is gonna end up being America Last.'
"I'm fed up with the US. Fuck off with your shitty attitude, shitty morale, shitty way of living. Just fuck off.\nSeparating kids from their parents at the border? I draw the line. We got NOTHING to learn from you. "
"McCain is trying to salvage what he can from the longstanding relationships we have built with our allies, even though Putin Jr is doing everything he can to sabotage it.\n\nMcCain is just one guy in a congress of hundreds. I don't see why he's getting shit on for saying the right thing at the right time. "

'According to the [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/us/politics/republican-donors-obamacare-repeal.html), this latest push is a result of big donors "refusing to contribute another penny until the struggling majority produced some concrete results."\n\nThese republicans don\'t give a flying fuck about Americans and their healthcare. All they care about is producing results, any result, no matter how terrible, so they can get money in order to get reelected in order to continue to pass shitty legislation. \n\nTurns out McCain actually might be a patriot and doesn\'t care too much about remaining in office for the sake of remaining in office. It\'s astonishing this kind of behavior is applauded. It should be expected from every politician. '
'What really pisses me off is that after this news broke, someone on my Facebook says "First time in my life I\'ve ever been rooting for the cancer." \n\nHoly shit!  As someone who is on the verge of losing someone I care about to cancer, FUCK THAT GUY!\n\nEDIT: Also, as someone with a pre-existing condition, HOW STUPID ARE THESE PEOPLE WHO WANT THIS TO PASS?!\n\n\nSorry about the rant. I\'m usually pretty chill but this has gotten me in such a state. \n\n'
'* Collins is "leaning no" (95% chance she is no, she has not voted for any repeal so far)\n* McCain is a McCain-no (so still like 60-40)\n* Rand Paul is a hell no (he voted for the last one though)\n* Murkowski is a "still looking into it" (she also never voted for any repeal)\n\nWe need 3 of these 4 to kill the bill.'
'Between McCain, Paul, and Collins, this bill is dead. Assuming all three of them keep their word of course. '
"The saddest thing about all of this is how a few billionaires control the system, it's never been so obvious. I'm looking at you Heller and Cassidy. It's heartbreaking"
'Incredibly rational:\n\n\n>"I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal. I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried. Nor could I support it without knowing how much it will cost, how it will effect insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it. Without a full CBO score, which won\'t be available by the end of the month, we won\'t have reliable answers to any of those questions."'
'The TrumpCare bill walked into my knife. He walked into my knife ten times.\n\nBA DUM\n\nIt had it coming (it had it comin)\n\nIt had it coming (it had it comin)\n\nIt was a bad bill all alonggggg\n\nIf you’da seen it\n\nBut no one saw it\n\nThe senate procedures were all to blame\n'
'Ahaha, get fucked GOP. '
"McCain could cement his legacy as one of two outcomes:\n\n1) He voted to save millions of Americans from losing healthcare and thousands from death.\n\n2) He voted to kill thousands of Americans and stripped millions from healthcare.\n\nSo far, he's cementing his legacy in the right part of history. "
"You know...I gave McCain a lot of shit and was very upset with him over his vote to bring the last one to the debate floor. \n\nAnd I'm willing to admit now, I was 100% wrong. Not afraid to admit it. "
'Good, no more of this "We\'ll pass it in the Senate, but only if the House promises not to pass it" bullshit, kill it and have it be done. If they come up with something that will actually attain 60 votes in the senate, then good for America. Until that time, leave the Affordable Care Act be and figure out solutions to fix the problems it has.'
'Why the hell do we have a government where we have to worry for our lives nearly every day? '
'Maybe we should write an algorithm that calculates peoples rates if this bill passes. Maybe that would make people see how bad this is and maybe light a fire under their asses. '

"If he's fired [here's ](https://act.moveon.org/event/mueller-firing-rapid-response-events/search/) where you can find your closest protest venue. Just type in your zip code. "
"*He's already being impeded*.\n\nWhat else do you call it when Trump starts firing people who are potential/actual witnesses for Mueller? What else do you call it when Trump and his attorneys are blasting the credibility of the investigation, of Mueller, Mueller's team, and the witnesses they've talked to?\n\n**That is impeding the investigation**. \n\nSo fucking do something about it, John, Lindsey, Paul. Put your goddamn money where your mouth is. You guys aren't poor. You can afford to lose your job and *save your fucking country.*"
'Look at the words being used by republicans –\xa0\'should be\', \'must be\'. These are political cover words for them and the party to distance themselves from Trump when he fires Mueller.\n\nThese cowards (or traitors, take your pick) would only be serious about protecting Mueller and his investigation of the word they were using was "will be allowed". That is drawing a line in the sand. The rest is just airy bullshit to make themselves sound good.\n\nPut up or shut the fuck up, McCain.'
"I think it is fairly well guaranteed that with all that's going on, Mueller is going to make himself heard very soon.\n\nDon't think Facebook is promoting all of this at this moment, years after the fact, out of a sense of decency. Facebook's data was collected by Cambridge Analytica and we are very soon going to find out what happened to it after that. \n\nThis is not a coincidence. Indictments were issued for the people running the Russian propaganda operation. Now the question is how they did it, and who helped them do it. \n\nIn parallel, and directly aimed at Trump (rather than Kushner and Bannon) is the hacking and publishing of the emails and what promises were made on each side. \n\nEither one of those threads should be enough to either cause a bill protecting Mueller, make Trump back off or precipitate Mueller's immediate firing. \n\nAt that point, it will be obvious exactly what Trump is up to and no bullshit internal recommendation is going to cover it. \n\nTrump would want to fire Mueller before anything else comes out, and this might be his lowest risk window to do it. Mueller needs to do something right about now. "
'Fuck John McCain. Never forget all the grandstanding he did about Obamacare then voted to repeal the mandate and supported the crappy tax bill that was shoved down our throats. '
"Why do people still link articles about McCain? Like I'm genuinely asking. He does nothing but lie and back pedal what he says. He will CONSTANTLY chastise trump but then immediately vote for his policies n shit. The man is spineless and simply wants to fool people and it's working. "
"Tired of Republicans saying this shit. Put up legislation to protect Mueller, or shut the fuck up. Don't piss on my leg and tell me it's fucking raining, ok? You guys aren't slick."
'as a reminder, the Kenneth Starr whitewater investigation, which resulted in Clinton being impeached for lying under oath about an affair, went on for 4 years and 8 months\n\n**1992** - The Whitewater Development Corp is dissolved, leaving Bill and Hillary Clinton with a loss of more than $40,000.\n\n**January 1994** - Attorney General Janet Reno appoints Robert Fiske Jr. as the independent counsel in charge of investigating financial irregularities in the dealings of the Whitewater property company. The Clintons, and their business partners, James and Susan McDougal, are implicated.\n\n**August 1994** - Fiske is replaced by the more conservative Kenneth Starr as the independent counsel investigating the Whitewater scandal. \n\n**September 1998** - Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr releases his report to Congress. The House votes to make the 445-page report public. '
'Shut the fuck up McCain. All you ever do is speak but then never follow through. You are the biggest coward of all.'
'But if Trump does fire him I will sternly chastise the president before ultimately going along with it.'
'So do something about it instead of just running your mouth for brownie points, you impotent hypocritical piece of shit. '
'If it somehow came to a vote to fire Mueller, McCain would be deeply troubled, then just vote the same as every other Republican.'
'ITT: expecting the guy with terminal cancer to do anything besides words '
"What if... Trump doesn't care about the Presidency, he cares about his Trump Org more and he doesn't want Mueller poking around in his business affairs. This is why I think he may resign before shit comes out. "
'John “word and No Action” McCain. Fuck off already.'
"So republicans who aren't running anymore like Flake and Gowdy got some magical balls all of a sudden. And McCain has brain cancer and doesn't give a fuck anymore. So you know Republicans and everyone know this investigation is right and just. Anyone who doesn't act is going to pay for supporting treason. I don't understand how this is even happening. Everyday Trump is in the White house is insane. "

"McCain has brain cancer and had to fly to D.C. from his home state when he should be recovering. \n\nCollins and Murkowski were consistent in their position and have to deal with more insults than others because they're women.\n\nAll three have done a great thing, and this pissing match is pointless.  "
'I gave Collins and Murkowski a lot of shit for their committee vote to allow DeVos to move onto the Senate confirmation vote.\n\nBut damn, they took Aaron Burr duel threats, threats that affected their states and they still stood by their vote.  Capito and Heller showed to be spineless though .'
'Anything to avoid admitting the hysterical spam about McCain was bullshit, am I right thinkprogress?\n\n'
"What McCain did was consistent with his behavior throughout his life. I often disagree with him, but he's not a hypocrite like so many of the GOP. \n\nMurkowski and Collins showed integrity and backbone throughout. It took ovaries of steel to stand against all the pressure, wheedling, threats and excoriation they have been subjected to. I'm taking some time today to send each of them a proper handwritten thank-you note, just like my mama taught me."
"All these sites were dead wrong about McCain and now seem too proud to eat crow. It's embarrassing, and a bad look. "
"McCain has the biggest name by far, flipped unexpectedly and has a mountain of good will because he's going to die within the year. Lol at this women circlejerking shit getting pushed to the top of this sub. Literally 3 articles about that in the top 10. \n\nY'all shit on a dude with brain cancer and you don't even have the balls to admit you were wrong"
'Fuck obamacare. Seriously. It made everything so much worse. All it did was make premiums EXPLODE. I wish that every piece of shit that voted to save this travisty of a healthcare plan was forced to use it. Good for gooses and ganders and all. '
"Once we have single payer you won't see rich Canadian's come down to the US for their surgeries anymore.  They'll be stuck in the same lines as the rest of the Canadians."
"I wouldn't say they saved it.  I'd say they doomed people to continuing higher premiums and mediocre coverage. "
'You guys are outrageous. After being completely wrong about McCain and spamming this sub about how big of a coward he was, he proves you all wrong. But instead of digressing you people find a way to discredit him as much as possible. '
'TIL deceiving your constituency and lining the pockets of private insurance CEOs at the expense of poor people who can\'t afford health insurance through ridiculous penalties and tax increases == "Saving Obamacare"'
'Collins and Murkowski had to face all kinds of threats from their own party (possibly threats of a funded primary fight, threats of destroying their political futures, even threats against their entire state, etc.), and who knows what McConnell and Trump promised them in return for a YES vote. Also, they have been vocal about ACA repeal, providing cover for other Republicans to break ranks.\n\nSo, a tip of the hat to them!'
"How about everybody who voted against it gets equal credit, okay? The fucking mental gymnastics required to keep the anti-McCain circle jerk alive are absurd. \n\nDuring his time in the Senate, he voted for a bunch of shit you didn't like, and some shit you did like, and did a bunch of other stuff you never even saw that was both good and bad. Now he's gonna be dead in a year so it doesn't really matter what he thinks. Can we stop trying to pretend that his vote here was anything but good?"
"The women in the photo were also getting death threats and threats of violence against them by their fellow Republicans.\n\nHeroes indeed, but I bet you in this instance, they are happy a guy (McCain) jumped in to make it so they aren't the only targets of hatred, and if he gets most of the share of the hate, they might be OK with that too"
'Now, Trump is going to do everything in his power to make ACA fail. Then, when it does, he\'ll say "I told you so". Sadly, a lot of people will be dumb enough to fall for it. '
'Not really.  GOP affords a loss of votes.  They did not expect McCain to vote nay, I think.  They did expect these two women to vote no, though.  Not really one person doomed this bill - all 51 of them are equally responsible for saving the aca.'

"Picking on an American war hero dying of brain cancer?  That's how you know he's a patriot and an alpha.  -TD"
'Yet he is silent on Michael Avenatti. That’s because he knows Avenatti will chew him up and spit him out, humiliate the daylights out of him. Like all bullies, Trump only goes after the people who are less able to take on a fight with this pathetic monster. I can’t wait for the new crop of millennial politicians to take this disgusting piece of crap down.'
"That's the thing, he's playing to the crowd. They eat this shit up. Lowest common denominator. Seriously the most vile people."
'These people will do anything for a small tax cut and to piss off "Dems" and "Libs." They talk about Democrats like we\'re diseased and should die, of course they have no empathy for the bereaved and the sick.'
"America has truly lost its shame.  Regardless of a person's political position for or against you or your platform, is there no decency left?  \n\nDo these people really represent who we are?"
"Has Trump insulted Jimmy Carter yet? Because at this point he's insulted all the other former presidents AND their families."
'Just remember all these idiots who voted for him and claim to support the troops are fake patriots. supporting the troops for them usually boils down to petty shit that lends itself to false patriotism. Wearing the star and stripes, not kneeling during a game, worrying about stolen valor. Its never about making sure troops are provided for during and after war. Mental health, veteran suicides. Its never about sending them to stupid wars or proper use of defense budgeting. Its not about helping homeless vets. Its always whatever token item they can find to be outraged about to prove how patriotic they are, so that they can turn a blind eye to the rest of it. If they can put a sticker on their truck, or a meme on facebook they are much happier. If they can shout second amendment and play war on the weekends with guns and not actually ever enlisted they are happy. it boils down to being a fake patriot every time. '
"If I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times: Donald John Trump is a goddamn sack of fucking goddamn shit."

"He didn't just say you weren't a war hero, he said he didn't like you because you got captured. I can't believe this wasn't a shit storm for Trump, it's insane! Argue about war hero or not all you want, but to mock a POW *because he was a POW* WTF?!?"
"Hell would freeze over first. \n\nWhich I'm sure Trump would deny as another climate change hoax. "
'John McCain is a hero\n\n>In mid-1968, John S. McCain Jr. was named commander of all U.S. forces in the Vietnam theater, and the North Vietnamese offered McCain early release because they wanted to appear merciful for propaganda purposes, and also to show other POWs that elite prisoners were willing to be treated preferentially.McCain refused repatriation unless every man taken in before him was also released'
'Trump has never apologized for anything in his life even when he was clearly in the wrong, yet he demands apologies from other people like ESPN and that reporter.\n\nHell, Trump has yet to apologize for spreading the whole Obama "birther" conspiracy. \n\nHe is just a scumbag of catastrophic proportions. '
"Ahh yes, the person who is calling out athletes for not being patriotic enough doesn't see a problem with his own remarks criticizing McCain because he was a prisoner of war. The lack of awareness of his own hypocrisy never ceases to be mind-boggling."
'>"If I took offense at everybody who has said something about me, or disparaged me or something like that — life is too short,” he said. “And on an issue of this importance to the nation, for me to worry about a personal relationship, then I\'m not doing my job.”  \n  \n"But seriously," added McCain, "fuck that dimwitted asshole." '
"If Trump started apologizing right now for every stupid thing he ever said he'd die before finishing."
"\n It must have took great courage to survive 5 years in a Vietminh prison camp. I have the upmost respect for that.\nThat was in the 70s though. Since then you have advocated for wars that caused the deaths of thousands of your fellow Americans. Lied to the people of Arizona by campaigning on one promise after another and never full filling them or out right lying. You only get away with it is because you constantly claim your a war hero and how people can't criticize you because of you self imposed status. You advocated the arming of Syrian rebels which turned out to be Jihadi groups. Even after that was discovered you still wanted to sent them weapons. You refuse to release the names of the donors to the McCain foundation. Are people buying you off McCain?\nYou may been a war hero years ago, but now your just sad bitter old man."
"Everyone's got their brilliant idea to finally rid us of Trump. I'm not going to pretend I'm any smarter than them, but I feel strongly that the solution to him is to stick to one indefensible thing he's done and ignore everything else.\n\nBanning trans people in the military? Won't stick because some people don't get trans culture.\n\nBanning Muslims? Some people are scared of Muslims, lots of people. Won't stick.\n\nForgiving a borderline Nazi sheriff? Some people are scared of Mexicans destroying the economy. Won't stick.\n\nBeing easy on neo-nazis? No one saw that coming but for whatever reason it won't stick.\n\nMcCain though is a war hero that was tortured until he lost the full use of his arms and came back to this country to serve in government. You may not agree with his policies, but you can't deny that he sacrificed a lot.\n\nTrump took that quintessentially American value, and mocked McCain for being captured at war. In doing so he attacked what Americans stand for fundamentally and whatever side of the fence you're on you can't defend that. It should be brought up constantly. Non-stop.\n\nNext week Trump might punt a baby. Who cares, report on it for a second then go back to talking about Trump mocking American prisoners of war. Be relentless and stick to it. He never apologizes so you just keep holding his feet to the fire and he'll eventually crack."
'McCain will be dead before Trump even tries to say something that resembles an apology.'
'The worst offense by far of what Trump has said to McCain about his military service is that Trump himself was eligible to go to Vietnam. But instead he landed himself 4 draft deferments.\n\nNow I understand that bone spurs can be painful, but his bony fucking feet gives him no right to mock someone who willingly went to war.\n\nTrump is a disgrace.'
"So that's why he's now a democrat? Petty revenge? Nice."
"How is there so many people that simply don't understand little Donnie T? \n\nThis guy will never pivot, never act like an adult,  never apologize, and never make you proud. It's been plain as day for his entire life."
"He hasn't apologized for a lot of things. His strategy is to divert attention from a scandal with a new scandal. Tax returns? We're focusing on Russia. Russia? We're focusing on racism? Racism? We're focusing on his poor handling of the hurricanes. Hurricanes? We're focusing on his UN speech. We never linger on a single point, and so it doesn't really get to process, and it normalizes his actions."
"it's not whether or not you were a hero that should be the offensive issue.   It should be that he held your capture against you\nYou were a prisoner of war, and he acted like that made you a lesser man.   Of course Trump wouldlook down upon the weak, the sick, and  the vulnerable.  That's who he is.  "
' Brain cancer is a terrible death sentence. McCain is a brave man to face it as eloquently as he did during the interview. He knows what he will have to face in the coming months and seems at peace with it'
"I don't like this headline at all.  It makes it sound like McCain is bitter and getting back at Trump for saying he wasn't a war hero when McCain is so much better than that.  I really doubt he gives a rats ass what Trump thinks of him."
"Okay, I have _had_ chemotherapy, three separate courses of it, and him serving while undergoing it is goddamn irresponsible. Your memory goes to shit, you can't concentrate, it's really hard to make decisions, and you're just, so, so tired. You shouldn't operate heavy machinery on chemo, let alone _shape the fate of a nation_."
"At this point, even if he did, it would be insincere. He doesn't want or care to apologize."
'Everybody: no fucking shit '
"He never apologized for any of it. And we all have long memories. He's shit on everyone. Every single person. "
"I don't always agree with his choices but dam if I don't respect him not taking the easy way out after being captured. "

"I really wish the media stopped framing this as just an issue for the poor.  I'm in the middle class and got health insurance because of the ACA (I have pre-existing conditions and I'm self-employed).  \n\nThis isn't just about the poor.  In fact, it's more about people like myself than it is about the poor.  From both sides of the aisle, and even the media, the middle class truly is forgotten in all of this.  \n\nEDIT: Thank you for the gold. \n\nEDIT 2:  I should add that I feel deeply for those who are negatively affected by the ACA.  It's hard to accept that the same piece of legislation that has helped so many, is the very thing that is driving so many people into financial ruin; or worse.  Our politicians on both sides have been failing us on this issue for a long, long time now. \n\n\n"
'When it was announced that McCain had brain cancer, most-every post I saw was bleeding-hearting for the guy along the lines of, "well, I don\'t agree with his politics, but he\'s a war hero and served his nation and I wish him the best".\n\nMy sympathies were instead for the single mother of three in her 40s who is also dying of brain cancer who doesn\'t have a senators health coverage and wealth, who needs Obamacare to have a chance at seeing her kids grow up, marry, and have children of their own.\n\nJohn McCain is killing her. He\'s a selfish "Fuck you, I got mine!" republican like all other selfish "fuck you, I\'m getting mine" republicans.\n\nHe\'s a piece of shit. I\'ve got zero fucks to give him.'
"I'm going to get crushed for this, but let me just say this about John McCain. He was shot down when flying over Hanoi, Vietnam and became a prisoner of war. One year after his imprisonment, his father was able to negotiate an early release. McCain refused because he didn't want to receive preferential treatment compared to other prisoners who had been imprisoned for a longer period of time. He spent another four and a half years being tortured as a prisoner of war.\n\nHe is an American hero and he is a patriot. \n\nWhen he flew to the Senate and voted the way he did, I was initially disappointed as well. But then he ripped into his colleagues on the Senate floor. He made it clear the bills that had been floated would not get his vote and called for a return to order. He asked for healthcare to go through the traditional debate/committee process so that the final product would have at least some bipartisan support. \n\nHe voted to proceed, not to take away anyone's healthcare. I suspect the reason was two-fold: it gave him a chance to speak to a captive audience (even the President waited for him to finish) and it gives him political points at home when he returns. For the voters who want to see the ACA gone, he will be able to tell them he voted to proceed so that the proposed bills could get a fair vote before returning to the order he called for. "
"That's not what happened. I'm a fan of the ACA, not a fan of McCain but this is the problem with the political discourse in this country. Yes, many of us would agree that his opposition to the ACA is shitty but frame it correctly. We don't need to make him look like an anti-human with no soul. He doesn't like the way healthcare is being implemented, he's not trying to rip insurance away from poor people. I'm so tired of the outrage culture. Someone disagrees with something so that means they must be a terrible human being who hates poor people? No. Many people act as if this is the only way to administer healthcare and if you disagree with that method well then you're a terrible human being. That and it's not just poor people that benefit from the ACA. Framing it that way makes it feel like a handout thus giving the other side more ammunition. Ffs. Come back down to earth please. "
'Jfc, he is one of the only R senators voting against the actual bill (not the motion to discuss the bill). How is it so hard for anyone on this sub to understand that?  As far as senators go, he has been one of the most outspoken against Trump. \n\nIf r/politics is going to bitch about McCain then we need to have a full on meltdown on the 48 senators that fall to the right of him on the political spectrum. '
"I must be the only person who got fucked by Obamacare.  I can't afford to have insurance, my premium went from 150 a month to over 500.  I don't know what to do anymore.  \n\n\nI'm currently paying the penalty and just hoping I don't get sick.  This sucks.  :(\n\n"
"I'm sorry I can't take it anymore this is ridiculous, Obamacare has made my family's life exponentially harder with it than without it. Where we live we have very few providers to choose from, because all others found they were taking too many losses and pulled out. Its not just my state either. My little sister has type 1 diabetes which was diagnosed at 2 years. Since my mother works for the local hospital we get discounted healthcare but it is still 5x what we paid before 2010. We have had to make serious adjustments to our lives and not for the better. There are many families like mine that are drowning with no sign of help because of this bullshit, and the left elites feigning care for the lower middle class are using the people that voted for them as shields to keep this shit policy when it only hurts people like my family.     "
"On a factual note, he did not take time out of cancer treatment. \n\nPatients with Glioblastoma have surgery and will rest for 6 weeks before beginning any chemo or radiation therapy. \n\nHe's still an enormous asshole though. "
"Well cool beans /r/politics, the man only put his life on the line and endured horrific torture for your country, but he disagrees with you on the role of government in health care. That undoes all of his prior actions.\n\nSheesh, you're all pathetic and need to grow up."
"Ummm he didn't vote for the bill... He voted in favor of allowing debate on the bill. He's already said he'll vote against the bill in it's current form. But he's also Republican so he probably wants a form of this bill to go.\n\nAlso, WTF is this subs obsession with McCain?"
"Anyone who doesn't support welfare is not a hero? Let's just say forget everyone who has ever voted against welfare/subsidies."
'Literally was just the sole Republican outside of Murkowski and Collins to knock down the "skinny repeal," so all you guys talking shit about McCain can choke on that. '
"Upon reflection, I'm tired of the endless stream of existential threats. "
'Uh, he voted against the shitty Trumpcare and against the Obamacare Repeal... Why the fuck is Reddit going after him?'
'He is more than "no hero" - He is a villain. An evil, repugnant villain. He has used his service as a shield to commit acts of harm to his fellow Americans. What a piece of shit. '
'Poor Americans already have access to healthcare. \n\nMedicare and Medicaid are a thing you fucking fear mongers.'
"First of all, I disagree with McCain on this vote.  But I also remember McCain Feingold.  I remember which GOP senator was the first to call GWB on the use of torture and to openly oppose the invasion of Iraq.  And I remember who served his country his whole life, perhaps most importantly during Vietnam,  where he suffered as a prisoner of war.\n\nJohn McCain isn't my favorite guy all the time, but he meets even the strictest requirements for consideration as a hero."
"Do you honestly think it is so simple as: I hate poor people so I vote yes\n\nIt's insulting for media sources to suggest there aren't legitimate arguments from both sides behind this healthcare debate. \n\nNobody hates people just because they're poor. "
"That is not what he voted for. He voted to start debate.

'Please correct me if I misunderstood, but I thought the vote was not to repeal ACA, but simply to DEBATE whether or not to repeal it.  Am I wrong about that?'
"It's sad seeing someone who served his country for so long who will die on the wrong side of history."
'Not defending anyone here, just pointing out what is *in the article:*\n\n> John McCain took time out of cancer treatment to vote against poor Americans accessing healthcare – he is no hero\n \nthen \n\n>To be accurate, the vote on Tuesday was only to open debate, and Senator McCain said his vote in no way guaranteed he would vote for the final bill. \n\n\nSo, I guess at least wait for the actual vote before we all get the pitchforks out.'

"She's a war criminal"
'Lots of cringeworthy ignorance in this thread. \n\nFirst of all, it’s doubtful McCain will even be able to vote on this confirmation by the time it reaches the Senate. If he’s not dead he will be too impaired to make the vote.\n\nSecond of all, this is the ONE issue that John McCain is absolutely, 100%, deeply personally convicted on. He really is principled when it comes to torture, it’s not at all just talk. You would know that if you knew that he is in large part responsible for legislation banning the use of torture and has repeatedly in the past spoken out against his party when it comes to this issue, often standing alone. Even during the worst of the Bush years — what he just called one of the darkest chapters in American history — when you apparently weren’t allowed to be a patriot if you didn’t support waterboarding, he didn’t budge. He’s farther left than many Democrats on this issue. There is absolutely no way in hell he would turn around and vote for this psychopath, even if he could.

'Just as a reminder, here\'s what military interrogators, FBI interrogators, and CIA interrogators have to say about the effectiveness of torture.\n\n[**Military Interrogator Matthew Alexander**:](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/28/AR2008112802242.html)\n\n>I know the counter-argument well -- that we need the rough stuff for the truly hard cases, such as battle-hardened core leaders of al-Qaeda, not just run-of-the-mill Iraqi insurgents. But that\'s not always true: We turned several hard cases, including some foreign fighters, by using our new techniques. A few of them never abandoned the jihadist cause but still gave up critical information. One actually told me, "I thought you would torture me, and when you didn\'t, I decided that everything I was told about Americans was wrong. That\'s why I decided to cooperate."\n\n>Torture and abuse are against my moral fabric. The cliche still bears repeating: Such outrages are inconsistent with American principles. And then there\'s the pragmatic side: Torture and abuse cost American lives.\n\n>I learned in Iraq that the No. 1 reason foreign fighters flocked there to fight were the abuses carried out at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo. Our policy of torture was directly and swiftly recruiting fighters for al-Qaeda in Iraq. The large majority of suicide bombings in Iraq are still carried out by these foreigners. They are also involved in most of the attacks on U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq. It\'s no exaggeration to say that at least half of our losses and casualties in that country have come at the hands of foreigners who joined the fray because of our program of detainee abuse. The number of U.S. soldiers who have died because of our torture policy will never be definitively known, but it is fair to say that it is close to the number of lives lost on Sept. 11, 2001. How anyone can say that torture keeps Americans safe is beyond me -- unless you don\'t count American soldiers as Americans. \n\n[**Former FBI Special Agent John Cloonan**:](http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Cloonan%20Testimony%20061008.pdf)\n\n>It is my belief, based on a 27 year career as a Special Agent and interviews with hundreds of subjects in custodial settings, including members of al Qaeda, that the use of coercive interrogation techniques is not effective. The alternative approach, sometimes referred to as "rapport building" is more effective, efficient and reliable. Scientists, psychiatrists, psychologists, law enforcement and intelligence agents, all of whom have studied both approaches, have came to the same conclusion The CIA\'s own training manual \nadvises its agents that heavy-handed techniques can impair a subject\'s ability to accurately recall information and, at worst, produce apathy and complete withdrawal. [...]\n\n>Of course, obtaining reliable information from jihadist foot soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq is vital to protect our troops, who are in harm\'s way. But even on the battlefield and under exigent circumstances, rapport building is more effective in gaining information for force protection in my opinion. Enhanced and coercive interrogation techniques are ineffective even under extreme circumstances. I\'ve spoken to a number of FBI agent\'s who were seconded to Gitmo as interrogator\'s. In confidence, they told me the vast majority of detainees questioned under these stressful conditions were of little or no value as sources of useful intelligence. [...]\n\n>Gaining the cooperation of an al Qaeda member is a formidable task, but it is not impossible. I\'ve witnessed al Qaeda members, who pledged "bayat" to Bin Laden, cross the threshold and \ncooperate with the FBI because they were treated humanely, understood what due process was about and were literally seduced by our legal system, as strange as that might sound.\n\n[**Former FBI Agent Ali Soufan**:](http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/soufan_testimony_05_13_09.pdf)\n\n>The issue that I am here to discuss today - interrogation methods used to question terrorists - is not, and should not be, a partisan matter. We all share a commitment to using the best \ninterrogation method possible that serves our national security interests and fits squarely within the framework of our nation\'s principles.\n\n>From my experience - and I speak as someone who has personally interrogated many terrorists and elicited important actionable intelligence- I strongly believe that it is a mistake to use what has become known as the "enhanced interrogation techniques," a position shared by many professional operatives, including the CIA officers who were present at the initial phases of the Abu Zubaydah interrogation.\n\n>These techniques, from an operational perspective, are ineffective, slow and unreliable, and as a result harmful to our efforts to defeat al Qaeda. (This is aside from the important additional considerations that they are un-American and harmful to our reputation and cause.) [...]\n\n>The Army Field Manual is not about being nice or soft. It is a knowledge-based approach. It is about outwitting the detainee by using a combination of interpersonal, cognitive, and emotional \nstrategies to get the information needed. If done correctly it\'s an approach that works quickly and effectively because it outwits the detainee using a method that he is not trained, or able, to resist.\nThis Informed Interrogation Approach is in sharp contrast with the harsh interrogation approach introduced by outside contractors and forced upon CIA officials to use. [...]\n\n>In summary, the Informed Interrogation Approach outlined in the Army Field Manual is the most effective, reliable, and speedy approach we have for interrogating terrorists. It is legal and has \nworked time and again. It was a mistake to abandon it in favor of harsh interrogation methods that are harmful, shameful, slower, unreliable, ineffective, and play directly into the enemy\'s handbook. \n\n>It was a mistake to abandon an approach that was working and naively replace it with an untested method. It was a mistake to abandon an approach that is based on the cumulative wisdom and successful tradition of our military, intelligence, and law enforcement community, in favor of techniques advocated \nby contractors with no relevant experience. \n\n>The mistake was so costly precisely because the situation was, and remains, too risky to allow someone to experiment with amateurish, Hollywood style interrogation methods- that in reality- \ntaints sources, risks outcomes, ignores the end game, and diminishes our moral high ground in a battle that is impossible to win without first capturing the hearts and minds around the world. It was one of the worst and most harmful decisions made in our efforts against al Qaeda.\n\n[**Former CIA Interrogator Glenn Carle**:](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/us/politics/04torture.html?_r=0)\n\n>[coercive techniques] “didn’t provide useful, meaningful, trustworthy information.”\n\n[**Former interrogators Matthew Alexander (who I mentioned earlier), U.S. Army intelligence officer Col. (Ret.) Stuart Herrington, former FBI special agent Joe Navarro, and military intelligence veteran Ken Robinson**](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-danzig/torture-did-not-lead-the-_b_857708.html) (in response to claims that the use of torture led to the capture of Osama bin Laden by U.S. forces):\n\n>Torture Did Not Lead the U.S. to bin Laden, It Almost Certainly Prolonged the Hunt.\n\n>The use of waterboarding and other so-called "enhanced" interrogation techniques almost certainly prolonged the hunt for Bin Laden and complicated the jobs of professional U.S. interrogators who were trying to develop useful information from unwilling sources like Khalid Sheik Muhammed.\n\n>Reports say that Khalid Sheik Muhammed and Abu Faraq al-Libi did not divulge the nom de guerre of a courier during torture, but rather several months later, when they were questioned by interrogators who did not use abusive techniques.\n\n>This is not surprising. Our experience is that torture is a poor way to develop useful, accurate information.\n\n>We know from experience that it is very difficult to elicit information from a detainee who has been abused. The abuse often only strengthens their resolve and makes it that much harder for an interrogator to find a way to elicit useful information. \n\n\nThese aren\'t academics musing on ethics from the safety of their own country. They\'re not politicians trying to win votes. These are (or were) professional interrogators just trying to do their jobs in the most effective way possible. The ethical grounds aren\'t being discounted by any means but in an "it\'s them or us" situation, ethics too often get left by the wayside. That\'s why it\'s important to educate people of the most effective interrogation techniques.\n\nIt might be easier to just torture suspects and hope for the best but the easiest way isn\'t always the most effective way. Fast, reliable information requires out-thinking terror suspects. The fact that it\'s also morally ethical and doesn\'t rally thousands of recruits to our enemies\' cause is an added bonus.'
'Why the fuck are we paying any attention to anything that comes out either side of ol two face\'s "deeply troubled" mouth? "Hot air, he\'s disturbed, maverick, etc etc." There, I\'ve given you a statement with as much substance and bearing as anything McCain has done in the last 2 decades'

For that alone she should not hold the office."
"McCain only has conditional sympathy. He speaks out like a rational adult only on issues with which he's had bad experiences himself. Voting no on Ryancare only after he's diagnosed with severe cancer. Speaking out against torture only because he was tortured.\n\nAnd that's why he's still a POS."

"...\n\n> On C-SPAN McCain says, “One aspect of the (Vietnam) conflict by the way that I will never ever countenance is that we drafted the lowest income level of America and **the highest income level found a doctor that would say that they had a bone spur. That is wrong. That is wrong. If we are going to ask every American to serve, every American should serve.”**\n\ni like that usa today found this and printed it!\n\nedit: as of 8.11pm no (edit: 'other') major media outlet is carrying this story yet.\n \n8.13: newsday has it, but only in a gathering of daily stories:\nhttps://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/trump-tax-plan-may-slash-benefits-for-retirement-savings-1.14582608\n\nfinally! 9pm: the hill just got it: http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/356648-mccain-takes-swipe-at-trumps-bone-spur-vietnam-deferment \n\n9.30: the story's now #1 when one searches for mccain generally on google. \n\n-sunday evening news. stories.  are.   so.   s.l.o.w.\n\nok, i'm done. gonna watch the walking dead. but i think this will be a major story tomorrow morning. 9.55pm\n\n10.30: cnn: \nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/10/22/politics/john-mccain-trump-draft-deferments/index.html"
'I still don’t understand the military people who side with trump.  He shits on service and sacrifice. Absolutely dodged the draft. Will get many killed needlessly. Uses them as a patriotic flag waiving exercise.  They are voting against their self interest with their lives on the line.'
'when asked about it, trump was unable to remember which foot he supposedly had bone spurs...he forgot which foot hurt so badly he could not serve.\n\nthis was after he had already been given 4 previous deferments for school.'
'His feet hurt so bad, he could barely go on a ski trip shortly after dodging the draft.'
'they should have hammered trump on this during the primaries, the beta bitch would have lost it.'
'I quite honestly don’t blame someone from getting out of serving in Vietnam. \n\n\nI do however have a problem with chickenhawks who don’t have to sweat their ass getting blown to hell but can actually make money off of the war effort. Fuck those assholes!\n\n\nI disagree with a lot of McCains positions but I respect he put his balls on the line when he could have skated. '
"WHY THE FUCK is nobody naming him!?\n\nEdit: serious question and not trying to be a dick or uninformed... I don't get it, I guess. \n\nThey're not in high school."
"I don't get military siding with Trump either. The buffoon is trying to use private companies as a way to make money. That's why the Niger guy got left behind. The contractors don't understand NO MAN LEFT BEHIND or LOOKING OUT FOR THE PERSON BESIDE YOU. \n\nBusiness just wants to make money. Fuck head counts. They got to deliver on time. \n\nTrump's whole admin is dumb as a box of rocks. "
'So our commander and chief is a draft dodger aka a coward. And he calls people out for not being patriots hahaha. He even uses over sea labor. Hypocrite. '
'You think McCain is pissed about Drumpf’s treatment of gold star families?'
"The bone spurs were ridiculous bullshit. When you're so rich you don't have to serve due to a fake made up injury"
'Personally, the only way i will go to war is, if the leader who declared war is fighting beside me'
'Donald Trump has no clue how brutal McCain can be, and he’s certainly no match.'
'Keep in mind what John McCain went through during the Vietnam war.  He was almost killed twice, and then captured as a PoW.\n\nThen realize that Trump mocks him and Trump\'s made-up "bone spurs" got him out of this insanity:\n\n> McCain followed his father and grandfather, both four-star admirals, into the United States Navy and graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1958. \n\n> He became a naval aviator and flew ground-attack aircraft from aircraft carriers. During the Vietnam War, he was almost killed in the 1967 USS Forrestal fire. While McCain was on a bombing mission over Hanoi in October 1967, he was shot down, seriously injured, and captured by the North Vietnamese. He was a prisoner of war until 1973. McCain experienced episodes of torture and refused an out-of-sequence early repatriation offer. \n\n> The wounds that he sustained during war have left him with lifelong physical disabilities.\n\nRegarding the fire on the USS Forrestral, that killed 134 sailors and inujred  161, during which a rocket let loose and started a chain reaction:\n\n> The impact of the rocket had also dislodged two of the 1000-lb AN-M65 bombs, which fell to the deck, and lay in the pool of burning fuel between White\'s aircraft and that of Lieutenant Commander John McCain.\n\n'
"3 of the last four US presidents (Clinton, Bush, and Trump) were born less than 3 months apart and each dodged serving in Vietnam. In their respective elections, Clinton and Bush defeated people who honorably served in wars overseas (Clinton defeated George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush defeated both McCain in the primary in 2000 and Kerry in the general 2004). Those who served often have their service used against them (McCain's supposed illegitimate child in 2000 and Kerry's swiftboating in 2004). I find all of this remarkable.\n\nEDIT: And I forgot that Clinton defeated Bob Dole (served in World War II) in 1996 and Bush defeated Gore (served in Vietnam) in 2000. Remarkable.\n\nEDIT 2: correction the whispers about McCain's illegitimate child in 2000 had nothing to do with the war, but he was accused of being a traitor during both the 2000 and 2008 Republican primaries "
'"Sen. John McCain doesn’t have to speak Donald Trump’s name to excoriate him."   \n  \nYes he does. Quit the silly games. Donald is an ass. A cowardly, lying ass. Say it or move on. Sorry about the brain cancer thing but come on. Do it. Say it. Be bigger than your political party. Step up, again.'
'This is going to get a hell of a tantrum'
"Where is the flag waving piece of shit Ted Nugent shitting his pants at his draft board so he doesn't have to go to Vietnam "
'He dying. He give no fucks'
'But he said he had his own "personal Vietnam", avoiding sexually transmitted diseases from all the bitches he was smashing while other dudes were fighting the war. That\'s honorable, right?'
'Trump is a liar and a coward.  He has no honor.'
'I personally hate the whole subtle shots bullshit. Just stupid fucking shit. What I like about all of this is what a prominent republican is actually talking about income inequality, and how if you’re rich you don’t have to serve, etc.'

"Our own fucking CIA already knows this, and recognizes climate change as a national security threat. GOP politicians are bought and sold by energy lobbyists, and as far as I'm concerned it's a crime against humanity to continue obstructing recognition of the problem. "
"Looks like someone soon to die is getting worried about his legacy. Too bad he couldn't find those balls of his ten years ago."
"We all understand that already John, but you don't even understand how to send an email.  Term limits, age limits, don't care what, we need to stop these geriatrics from dying in office before they take us with them.  They are simply not mentally equipped to deal with the pace of modern change."
'Fuck you "maybe". Honestly fuck the GOP for decades of ignoring extremely serious science.'
'No shit '
"Well, John, that's just great.\n\nYou're up against many many millions of ignorant - and proud of it - 'Christians' and 'Evangelicals' who are single issue voters (abortion! or stop the gays!) who will vote single issue and that means climate change deniers in office and a continued rejection of science. \n\nIf you can convince that idiotic mob, which you can't, we might have a chance.\n\nRepublicans. Yeesh."
'Democrats fight and struggle for years to stop climate change, they get attacked by anti-truth right wing extremists, and nobody bats an eye.\n\nA single republican stands up, everyone loses their minds.\n'
"Fuck McCain and his opportunistic ass in this time of disaster. He's going to backtrack once again once he needs Republicans to vote for him.  "
'4 hurricanes in the span of a month, the entire west coast is on fire, houston is underwater, antigua and barbuda is completely destroyed and all they can give us is a "may be". Fucking pathetic. '
"How the hell do you even come back from the anti-climate change position you've made your platform on?  And will they admit some level of culpability for enabling the fossil fuel suppliers to knowingly cause AGW?  Someone deserves to be punished for purposefully ignoring the science for so long, damnit."

'"So he\'s failing to uphold his oath of office. Big deal! He\'s new at this!!!"\n\n-republicans'
'With all his flaws, atleast McCain continues fighting for some American principles. Too bad a "scolding" won\'t accomplish anything and will be forgotten in an hour. '
"I blame the press for this one. They are letting themselves be distracted by Donald's minor bullshit like the Tillerson spat rather than the big issues. The press should be asking about this at every one of Sarah Heffalump Sanders' briefings, rather than trying to normalize the trump regime. "
"It's shocking to me that the Mnuchin/Tillerson announcement flew under the radar, and it's even more shocking to me that the October 1st deadline failure also flew under the radar.  What's going on? Where are the NYTimes and WashPo?"
'"What?  Russian sanctions?  Ummm...Hey everybody!  Look over here!  I\'m arguing with football players!"'
'Miserable shits are mocking McCain for dying. This man has done a lot more than Trump ever will for this nation, you *fucks.*'
'"Congressman wags finger at corrupt, abusive president while rest of congress does nothing."'
'>"Isn’t the main job of the president to execute the laws congress passes?"\n\nImpeach his guilty ass'
'So the penalty for not imposing sanctions is a scolding? How broken is this system?'
'Wait, he missed the deadline?\n\nSo he ignored Congress??? On RUSSIA SANCTIONS???\n\nWe are living in the darkest timeline.  \n'
"He was going to go to Russia next year, but the US Men's Soccer team decided that wasn't a good idea, hence they lost to the worst team in their group."
"I'm gonna switch to Controversial. I'll guess they're all just talking about how dumb John McCain is.\n\nI'm back. Yup."
'Grandpa maverick had to scold Baby Donny.  \n\n“No! No! We don’t put Russian sanctions up our butts! That’s not how we do things!”\n\n*sounds of spanking and a 71 year old man crying* '
'R{epublicans,ussians} are literally destroying America, and 35% of the country could not care less as long as brown people suffer.'
'What the hell is wrong with our government?\n'
"First I was mad at him for seeming to be down the last health care destruction bill, but then he turned around and crushed it, and now he's being a real leader while we lack one. It would be nice if he kept up being a mensch until he retires. We need a few politicians on the other side of the isle that aren't outright evil."

'It’s not complicated.  The White House is filled with assholes.  It’s like that scene in Spaceballs when Dark Helmet asks, “How many assholes we got on this ship anyway?”'
"Imagine if Obama said some shit about McCain not being a hero because he was captured, or that torture worked on him during the 2008 election.  It would have ruined Obama.  Ruined. \n\nThe GOP don't care about insulting their own party, because they will just scream RINO and it will be accepted. "
"It wasn't a joke. It was just pure malicious nasty cuntsomeness."
"I just can't wrap my head around republicans. I am a left leaning liberal, and I am willing to compromise. However these motherfuckers are just so stupid. Their solution to everything is the polar opposite of whatevers liberals say.\n\n\n\nWe have a gun problem? \n\nWe need more guns! \nI just wish they could compromise and meet us half way.\n\n"
"They're upset about the leak, not the joke. And they're signaling that as hard as they can."
"What a stand-up man.  It's a shame the primary was stolen from him or he would be president."
"It wasn't a joke; it was an insult. "
"Because it wasn't a joke. That is how horrible people think. "
"Republicans don't apologize- it's viewed as weakness. Why is this so difficult to understand?"
"Well when you want to be a fascist dictator one thing you never do is admit you're wrong or apologize.  You think this is a joke, but sooner or later you dumb fucks need to wake up before the ICE (Gestapo) raid your house next.  We're way beyond the joke phase.  "
"SHS' justification for why DJT is a better man than Al Franken is because Trump hasn't admitted to any of his dozens of sexual assault accusations.\n\nSo to Republicans, if they do evil but don't admit to doing evil, they haven't done anything evil."
'Is Bernie Sanders really that shocked?  The bar has been set so low at this point. Even if there was an apology, it would be insincere and meaningless.'
'And a week from now, it will be forgotten. Sickening how many disgraceful things the White House has done and people dismiss after a short time.  History will view these “leaders” as a mistake and constant embarrassment. '
"I love you Bernie, but a Trump White House refusing to apologize for saying something offensive shouldn't be beyond anyone's comprehension. Being an asshole and not apologizing is practically the platform Trump ran on.."
'Apologies are meaningless, especially coming from the gaggle of assholes that currently pollute the Executive Branch.'
"These people will not - cannot - apologize for anything because they perceive that as weakness. They've painted themselves into a moral corner by screaming that 'I' am always right and 'they' are always wrong. It's childish, stupid, loutish, and antithetical to Christianity, Democracy, and even civilization itself. "
'Fuck this administration and fuck Rump'
"I understand it. \n\nThey're morally bankrupt cartoon villains. \n\nThat's really all there is to it. "
"It's beyond your comprehension that a White House run by a man who mocked a handicap reporter, among other things, won't apologize for being rude and insensitive?"
'They do not apologize for ANYTHING no matter how wrong it is. This is just so wrong on so may levels. This is the lowest point in White House modern history.'
'McCain himself is probably beyond all of this, and whoever said that shit knows it. What makes all this so bad is that it was aimed at his family and calculated to hurt them. I lost my mom to a brain tumor, and nothing about that shit is funny, ever. '
'How is *any* of this beyond comprehension? This is the same as every response Donald Trump has had o every controversy since he announced he was running for office. He refused to apologize when:\n\n* He called immigrants rapists\n* He made fun of John McCain for being a POW\n* He mocked a disabled reporter\n* He said Megyn Kelly had "Blood coming out of her wherever"\n* He proposed a total muslim ban\n* He proposed that Rafael Cruz was part of the JFK assassination conspiracy\n* He called Hillary Clinton a "nasty woman" during the third presidential debate\n* He drew a moral equivalence between the Neo\\-Nazis in Charlottesville and their counter\\-protestors\n* He had a crowd of Boy Scouts at the Jamboree boo Barack Obama\n* He upset the wife f the fallen Sgt. La David Johnson over the phone\n* He referred to Africa and Haiti as "shithole countries"\n\nWe\'ve come to expect every bit of this. In every one of these situations his response boiled down to: "How could you possibly have construed my comments like that?!?" or "I was just joking guys!!"'
'the right believe in "never apologize".. its part of the big lie idea, though in this case its not a lie. But they think apologizing is weakness. Even when they are more than obviously wrong.\n\nand can we quit fucking calling it a joke.. the perfect smokey eyes was a joke.. saying Who cares about mccain he will be dead soon when he really will be dead soon, isnt a fucking joke in any culture on the fucking planet.\n\nAnd this is fucking cnn.. we know you lean a bit left.. why the fuck are you so timid in calling right wingers out? think they would call it a joke on fox news, if an obama aid said this? Fuck they didnt even call the smoke eyes joke a joke.. and yet the left is trying to be all polite and all. "oh yall want to call it just a joke, well we will report it tha way so yall dont freak out"\n\nyeah fuck off with that shit. Its not biased to point out fucking reality.'
'I hate that they call him/them the "white house." The white house is a symbol that strikes a certain patriotic chord. Current President...not so much.'
"They won't because they really don't like or respect McCain."
"Apologizing shows weakness and showing weakness is death in politics.\n\nYeah, I don't buy for a second that Trump didn't read his copies of Mein Kampf or Zweites Buch that he kept in his bedside drawer."
'This does not surprise me in the least because from my experience being bullied narcissistic bullies never apologize. An apology would mean nothing because they would not mean it.'
'McCain the warhawk. The U.S. would have less problems if they spent the money at home, instead of spending it on wars around the world. Like the roman empire, we are trying to control the world, while we collapse within. '

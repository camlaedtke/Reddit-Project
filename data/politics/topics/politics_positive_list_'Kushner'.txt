Kushner loses access to top-secret intelligence
Background check chief has 'never seen' mistakes and omissions at level of Jared Kushner forms
Jared Kushner Still Doesn’t Have Security Clearance After a Year At the White House
'Cue Trump giving Kushner clearance'
'> Jared Kushner and the other WH staffers working on the highest level interim security clearances have had their clearances downgraded -- a move that limits their access to sensitive government documents'
'I took a look at DrudgeReport, who currently list the story as:\n\n"Kushner Keeps \'Secret\' Clearance"\n\nIt links to a Politico article titled: Kushner loses access to top-secret intelligence'
">Kushner is not alone. All White House aides working on the highest-level interim clearances — at the Top Secret/SCI-level — were informed in a memo sent Friday that **their clearances would be downgraded to the Secret level**\n\nSecret level is the second lowest classification level that exists. He won't be able to see *anything* of consequence.\n\n*Edit:* Yes, I know it's also technically the second highest under TS, but there are a host of SCI 'codeword' clearances that have TS as a prereq which are now inaccessible to him. More importantly, we err on the side of classifying at the higher TS level when in doubt, so SECRET really doesn't cover much of anything."
"Now Ivanka's going to have to hand stuff to him."
'New security classification caveat: TOPSECRET // NOKUSH'
"Kushner was never part of the campaign. In fact, Ivanka has been married to Kevin Hart the whole time. Believe me, folks. He's funny, that man. "
'How many of you get Washington Post news alert notifications and immediately go to /r/politics for the conversation?'
"Hopefully he's forgotten everything he had access to so far, what with his brain and all."
"Daddy ain't gettin' no Vajanka tonight!"
"THANK YOU. Whoever was in charge of this decision, thank you for following established US Government protocol.\n\nNever thought I'd thank anyone for being a by-the-book bureaucrat, but before this year, I had no idea how far off-the-book, out-the- library-door and down-the-street-at-the-pool-hall nonstandard protocol could be."
"I don't know if it's scary or hilarious that 18 year old privates in the army have higher security clearance than a senior presidential advisor. "
"Let's not fuck around here... 100% chance that Bone Spurs will pass him anything and everything."
'What’s amusing about this is that if you sort all of the posts on this topic by Controversial, there aren’t any Trump supporters trying to defend Kushner’s access. \n\nEven they know how forked up this whole thing was '
"Jared selling state secrets to pay off debts would be bigger than anything we've heard about yet. It's worse than obstruction by magnitudes.\n\nA big IF here, of course, but considering Kushner's history and stupidity... well, I mean, we're well acquainted with the timeline we're now in.\n"
'Oh cool, only took a year.'
"how could Trump himself have security clearance though?  Doesn't he have the **exact same issues Kushner does?**"
"Shouldn't Ivanka lose her's as well?"
'The crowd that was up in arms about an email server sure did a lot of looking the other way when it comes to nepotism, conflict of interest, and access to sensitive documents.\n\n"I\'d be in jail if I did that!"  Heard that from a lot of ex-military types.  Wonder how quickly they\'d have wound up in deep shit if they had attempted to update their security clearance form information 30 or 40 times?\n'
'Why does he still have a security clearance?'
'But his emails...this oughta be good. '
'Anyone surprised? Hypocrites the lot of them. '
'this smells a lot like the NYT story of the Don Jr emails before they disclosed that they knew what was in the emails. I bet Politico knows and is waiting on a Kushner camp denial. '
"I'm sure he'll be turning over the emails to comply with Presidential records collection laws annny day now."
'On this week\'s episode of, "It\'s OK if you\'re a Republican."'
"I am 100% convinced that I am living in a simulation. You can't tell me otherwise."
">“Fewer than 100 emails from January through August were either sent to or returned by Mr. Kushner to colleagues in the White House from his personal email account. These usually forwarded news articles or political commentary and most often occurred when someone initiated the exchange by sending an ***email to his personal rather than his White House address.***”\n\nDJT Jr? \n\n>People familiar with the account say it was primarily set up for Kushner’s personal communications, ***but he has used it to communicate with acquaintances outside the White House about matters relating to Trump and the administration, according to people who have received messages, as well as with his White House colleagues.*** \n\nSure doesn't sound like an innocent email.\n"
'Jared Kushner looks like a young Mr Burns. '
'I scanned the top 200 out of 343 comments.\n\nNot a single defense from a Trump supporter.\n\nPerhaps we have found their limit or maybe the bot-makers are busy reprogramming them with the latest talking points...'
'Trump supporters right now: "What? I thought it was ok to do that. You all said it wasn\'t a big deal when Hillary did it."\n\nThat\'s how they try to weasel their way out of their own hipocracy. By saying that we\'re the hypocrites for demanding they hold themselves up to their own standards. \n'
'You know this is straight from Bannon to Politico.'
'The hypocrisy in these people is astounding. '
'Irony is such a beautiful thing'
'Wtf I love private emails now\n\n-Trump Supporters '
"This is the party that was upset that Hillary deleted, what, 20-50 thousand emails about a thoroughly investigated and resolved Embassy attack, but didn't think anything of it when the outgoing Bush/Cheney administration deleted millions of them related to the still ongoing Iraqi War."
'I wish this were even remotely surprising to me.'
'Calm down, people. The only reason everyone was concerned when Hillary did it was because Russia might have hacked her emails. Not an issue with these guys. They are inviting the Russians into the Oval Office and GIVING them all the intel they want. No hacking of emails required. '
'Get ready for a huge wave of no reaction whatsoever!'
"Just when I think Trump and his family can't get any dumber, they do something like this and totally redeem themselves!"
'As much as I would like it to happen....he’s not going anywhere because nepotism.'
'Now all of a sudden republicans are gonna care about the details of what the emails actually are and the specific laws. '
">With the new information provided by the Paradise Papers, the list of known Kushner ties to Russia now includes discussing a secret communication channel with the Russian ambassador to Washington; meeting with the head of a Russian state-owned bank during the campaign; attending a meeting organized by Donald Trump Jr. with a Russian lawyer; and using Russian money through Milner to fund real estate projects.\nIn all cases, Kushner failed to disclose his Russian connections in a timely fashion, leading Democratic lawmakers to call for Kushner’s security clearance to be revoked.\n\nHe's not too bright, is he?\n"
'Can someone remove his security clearance already? How many times do you have to lie before you get sent to jail?'
"Kushner doesn't disclose shit on forms, even after a few tries."
"Just 30 years ago he'd be facing a firing squad. But thanks to Republican traitors this guy still has security clearance."

Among other things, the two men discussed a possible White House job for Mr. Harris.\n\n>**The job never materialized, but in November, Apollo lent $184 million to Mr. Kushner’s family real estate firm, Kushner Companies. The loan was to refinance the mortgage on a Chicago skyscraper**.\n\n>Even by the standards of Apollo, one of the world’s largest private equity firms, the previously unreported transaction with the Kushners was a big deal: **It was triple the size of the average property loan made by Apollo’s real estate lending arm**, securities filings show.\n\n>**It was one of the largest loans Kushner Companies received last year**. An even larger loan came from Citigroup, which lent the firm and one of its partners $325 million to help finance a group of office buildings in Brooklyn.\n\n'

We didn\'t decide these were scandals, *you did*, and we can\'t figure out why it\'s suddenly not a big deal to you guys.\n\nThe things we thought were scandals were when Trump bragged about grabbing women by the pussy because he\'s a celebrity, or claiming the Puerto Ricans are in dire straits because they\'re lazy, or the many many many times his campaign claimed absolutely no ties to Russia, before they uncovered all the ties to Russia. We haven\'t even found anything illegal yet but they keep lying about it anyway!\n(this is, of course, only a partial list)\n\nWe don\'t care about travel plans sent to private e-mail accounts, we just want to know why all of a sudden *you* don\'t care.'

"I'm not surprised no one has really commented on the meat in this article because everyone seems to be replying to a title only.\n\n>Kushner’s lawyer Abbe Lowell said his client “uses his White House email address to conduct White House business” and that Kushner exchanged fewer than 100 emails with White House colleagues through the personal account. In most cases, those exchanges were initiated by the other party sending a message to Kushner’s private account, Lowell said.\n\n>Kushner forwarded such messages to his official White House email account to comply with the Presidential Records Act, which mandates that documents about White House activities be preserved, according to Lowell.\n\nIt's not surprising people who have had an extensive professional career would be contacted through various means. When you have two emails, two phones, two phone numbers, it's hard to completely separate the two. I carry a work phone, and occasionally my SO calls me on it because I've forgotten my personal phone or vice versa. Or sometimes you make calls with the other phone and so forth.\n\nWhat's important is how the data is handled. If they are forwarding those emails to the official WH.gov email for preservation that's fine.\n\nAnd of course parallels will be drawn to HRC. From my reading it seems, these aren't as bad as someone setting up a private server to be used for ALL government email work, and to decline the use of an official State.gov email."

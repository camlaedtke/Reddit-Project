US Senate healthcare repeal bill fails
'After tonight, we have a new villain. Mike Enzi - (R) Wyoming - decided that two hours of debate over a bill that was revealed a mere hour before was too much time and filibustered **ANY** debate by telling pointless stories. '
'So Trump is gonna wake up tomorrow morning  with the Russian sanctions bill on his desk (veto proof) and no Obamacare repeal.\n\nLOL'
'I imagine McCain sitting in the Senate chambers looking at Reddit on his phone, thinking "suck it, haters"'
"Don't look at this as a victory. Nearly 50 senators went to work in the middle of the night and voted in favor of letting 20,000 of their fellow citizens die every year. "
'John McCain you sneaky son of a bitch.'
'The first man Trump insulted personally as a candidate just took down his needed achievement. Karma.'
'Fuck Heller.'
'For all those who claimed the man had no spine, this is it. This is having a spine.'
'McConnell looked and sounded like a kid who just learned his dog died when he realized he would not be able to take away health insurance from millions.'
"There's going to be a lot of people who point out, rightly, that Mccain has often failed to put his vote where his mouth is.\n\nBut that doesn't mean his vote didn't matter or say something here. People are flawed, people disappoint, people are hypocrites, we all are.\n\nBut for a moment lets focus on the positive bits maybe?"
"I've never been more relieved in my entire life. Nor have I ever stayed up this late to watch fuckin' C-SPAN. "
"For months, Republicans have excused their awful, destructive legislation by promising it wouldn't become law. A magical bill would come along and fix everything before the process was over, they said.\n\nToday they threatened to give us more of that (skinny repeal will go to Magic Conference), while also sending insurers into much more turmoil (heads up: we promise death spirals). And ultimately, we all know they don't have a magic fix. \n\nI do not believe this one is behind us, but I am going to sleep a bit better tonight. "
'David Jolly on MSNBC: "Tonight was an incredibly embarrassing night historically for the republican party...This is a historic failure for Donald Trump."\n\nHAHAHAHAHA '
'Remember, the pressure came from us.  We, the people.  Calling, writing, and showing up.  \n\nThis is our nation.  Participation rules the day. '
'McCain just pulled a "face turn" on us. God damn it I haven\'t been this happy in MONTHS!\n\n-McConnell has been defeated AGAIN.\n\n-Healthcare is more than likely saved for now (at least if the GOP doesn\'t touch this till after midterms.)\n\n-The GOP look mighty crazy, criminal even. They can spin it against the Dems all they want; they went through this bullshit for nothing. So they anger the constituents who wanted this AND piss off people to the other side come 2018.\n\n-President Sex Offender has no healthcare bill to sign. But what he does have is a Russian Sanctions Bill to mull over.\n\nJust ecstatic. We saved healthcare so now let\'s get our Internet Rights protected!'
'Somewhere, in a gross dark room, Steve Bannon finally touched his lips to his dick.'
'How embarrassing for the GOP'
'Too freaking close.  I can finally unclench phew. \n\nCelebratory USA gif: https://i.imgur.com/3crhsBk.gifv'
'1 Vote away from 16 million people losing health care.... What a country'
'John McCain I apologize for my harsh comments here on Reddit.'
'Draft dodger denies volunteers from serving'
'It was never about the money. Or military preparedness. It was a distracting bone he could throw to his base.'
"Anyone hiding behind the cost argument is just finding any front they can to justify their pleasure that another right is being taken away from someone that isn't them. Someone wants to fight for this country, let them. "
"So did Obama's trips, as did Bush's trips, as did Clinton's trips. As it turns out, it costs a lot of god damn money to staff a full secret service, AF1, and motorcade no matter who the person is. "
'Talking with friends in the army it seems universal that banning transgender people makes sense.  If you are transgender in the army than you are considered to have a mental illness and can\'t serve in a combat role.  \n\nWith that said the army is currently trying to move to an entire fighting force  where every person has a combat role.  That basically forces transgendered people out of the army due to their "illness" regardless of what Trump said.  \n\nFwiw, I don\'t care if your trans gay fat black or blue.  Live your life and I\'ll live mine. '
'Don\'t forget most of the money goes to trump as well. It\'s like a double "fuck you" to the taxpayer.'
'The cost of transition surgery depends on the length of the dick.  For example, if Trump wants to transition, he qualifies for the MAGA special.  A 2 inch dick, like his, is 90% off regular cost.'
'Like trump gives a shit. His only purpose is to milk it for everything he can, it was never about the people of the country.'
"Are we going to make Trump pay back the tax dollars he's stolen from Americans when this is all said and done?"
"Can someone post this on r/conservative? I'm banned there and I wanna see their reaction. "
"Trump would say that's unfair and irrelevant since he is heterosexual."
'If a parent said "Sorry, Jimmy, we can\'t afford antibiotics for you when you get sick. But we\'re going on a two-week long cruise in Europe without you this summer," we\'d all recognize that as awful, right? That\'s what this is on a national scale: denying children medical care in order for other people to enjoy luxuries. Luxuries that they can already afford anyway.'
'"Listen folks, there is no money for that"\n\n"Well where\'d it go"\n\n"My pocket"'
'I remember when everyone was freaking out about how Obama was ruining the economy by raising the debt. It looks like the GOP only sticks to a narrative when it helps them. '
'*"If they would rather die," said Scrooge, "they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population."*\n\nI can\'t tell the difference between a caricature of penny-pinching cruelty and a real senator anymore.'
'There is a special place in hell for anyone refusing to support children with cancer\n'
"Obviously meant that it'll be hard to fund a $14 billion program after we've spent $1 trillion on these tax cuts"
'Don\'t forget, $1 trillion is after they do their voodoo "growth" math on it. The actual tax cuts are much greater.'
"If you're a Republican, you're more than likely going to Hell. It's pretty cut and dry at this point. "
'Honestly, millions of Americans thought Trump was the "lesser evil", so I say, you guys sadly sort of deserve this.'
"Seriously, fuck these people.  The refusal to fund children's health insurance directly affects me and my family.  "
'It just blows me away that an entire political party in this country could be so morally bankrupt.  As a "modern" society we should be outraged at the cruelty displayed by these scumbags.  The tribalism is alive and well.  \n\nMy dad is a hardcore Trump supporter and listening to him basically regurgitate fox news propaganda in trying to justify party over country just leaves me speechless.'
"Gop legislator, sick kids aren't donating to my campaign.. Shrug "
"So why doesn't anyone actually ask this idiot how exactly he expects children to help themselves. Are we supposed to put children to work so they can afford their own healthcare? "
'Of course. That’s “Starve The Beast” 101. That’s the entire point of slashing the taxes in the first place.'
'Republicans fuck our youth again '
'Didn’t know about Orrin Hatch until his name came up as last in line for the presidency if everyone else before him were unable to do so. What I’ve seen so far tells me he’s just another GOP asshole. Hypocrite? Check. Plays the victim card amazingly well? Check. Believes people should not depend on the government but has no problem giving government handouts to corporations? Check. '
"Mazie Hirono, a Senator from Hawaii, has stage 4 cancer. She's been at rallies to protect healthcare, and she voted no.\n\nAnd she didn't get a standing ovation."
"People who say he **only** voted for debate...That's all we need to know. Do you think McConnell will allow a bill to pass that INCREASES the number of insured & thus INCREASES taxes on the wealthy? No. McCain's vote for debate is a vote allowing McConnell's agenda, which will certainly have a negative impact on the poor and a large portion of the middle class. \n\nMcCain can try to dress up his vote for debate as much as he wants. That doesn't change the fact that had he just stayed in his hospital bed, or voted against debate, McConnell's agenda wouldn't have had a chance. "
"Hey, guys?  I'm startin' to think that maybe John McCain isn't the hero that we never really thought he was..."
'Meanwhile conservative subreddits are calling him a RINO and traitor for voting no on the other vote. \n\nEdit: In retrospect "conservative subreddits" is too general, obviously not everyone wants the same thing. Just found it funny you have people on both sides calling him a failure for two different reasons in the same debate.  '
"We've known McCain was no hero since [The Keating Five Scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keating_Five). He was one of them...\n\nSlight correction. He's a hero for his service, and for enduring torture during the Vietnam War.\n\nBut he's made a lot of bad decisions since then."
"This isn't just an issue for the poor: My girlfriend and I are middle class, well-employed, and she actually comes from a well-off family.\n\nThe ACA has been a life saver for us as well because she's bipolar and Type 1 diabetic, which almost made you uninsurable before that time. We get our healthcare through my employer (she's self-employed), but without the ACA she'd be at risk of rescission."
'ITT: Comments that did not age well at all.'
">  the time for civil discourse may well be over. \n\nOn fucking point!  Civil discourse didn't work when Obama was president and the republicans were stonewalling.  Now they have power and they are bulldozing their way through with no plan or direction.\n\nDirect action is what is going to be required.  Daily protests, floods of LETTERS (NOT EMAILS), hourly calls, etc....\n\nMake them feel the pain.\n"
'Haha, fuck you Independent. '
"Don't we look like asses now?"
'suspend healthcare for congress until they use a system similar to other 1st world countries. problemo solved.'
'This article looks moronic now. '
'Didnt he just vote to open this to a debate that the public can see while creating a law that isnt rushed garbage? \n\nIm sick of these misleading headlines. '
"Another awesome headline from the independent. I'm sick and tired of their headlines being 90% of the time false. What do you know? It's false again. McCain voted to open debate on the bill, he ultimately voted against it. Unfortunately idiots will see the headline and assume what it suggests. "
'How embarrassed is OP right now?'
'Is that the same non-hero that single-handedly crushed the skinny repeal?'
'Ana Navarro yesterday: McCain\'s speech was a "lion\'s roar"\n\nNo, it was hypocrisy from a stubborn old man who will never change.'
"McCain got a call on the floor from Trump himself, and he pretty much stood his ground against this bill.  His vote alone mattered majorly, so I wouldn't talk much against him at this moment.  It could have been far worse if he hadn't voted against it tonight."
'What a douche! '
"Didn't Reddit just love John McCain a couple weeks ago?"
'BS. He did not vote against health care for poor Americans. He voted to allow debate on the issue. He said that he could not support the bill in its present form but he did support bringing it up and debating it. The title of that article is mere propaganda.'
'Holy shit Reddit. He just voted to open the floor for debate. Nothing else. '
"Take was a vote to open the topic of Repeal to debate. Just a debate. John McCain voted to debate the topic of healthcare. Stop with the over dramatization of this vote. It's ridiculous and smacks of health string tucking political games."
'Funny... You guys were dick riding him last week.... '
"his behavior lately makes me think the cancer isn't a bad thing since he has followed the party line 99% of the time\n\nmccain sucks balls"
'Those Nambian bastards were responsible for the Bowling Green massacre. Never forget!!'
'Nambia has always been at war with Zamunda.'
'People shit all over Gary Johnson for his "Allepo moment" but Trump is having those moments every damn week. Who are these people who are still supporting him? According to Gallup\'s weekly poll, he has 9% approval from Democrats, 35% from independents, and 81% from Republicans. I just don\'t get it. He says uneducated shit seemingly constantly. This is why education funding is important! \n\nSource: http://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx '
'Everyone knows he meant Namibia. Gotcha style pomposity is not a winning strategy to get the middle 10% on your side.'
"At first glance I read Namibia and was curious to find out when it had stopped existing.\n\nBut then I realized it's an article about a typo. Seriously? I think there are more serious reservations about Trump to have. "
"That's our Trump, the village idiot who became king"
'Haha this is it? This is where we\'re at?\n\n2016: "Trump\'s a racist, homophobic, misogynistic, xenophobe!! He\'s going to make gays get electric shock therapy and he\'s going to put muslims in camps!!"\n\n2017: "Trump misread a word from his Teleprompter!!"\n\n\nI think he\'s doing pretty well based on the expectations y\'all set during the election.'
'Sarah Palin thought Africa was a country, so no new geography lessons learned in the GOP.'
'Jesus fuck its Namibia. He forgot an I and is now "inventing" a country'
"I mean it's ridiculous, but this kind of reporting at this point is just petty. It does nothing "
'Really?? This is just taking petty to a whole new level. Didn’t expect anything more from CNN though. '
'... Namibia? Ffs guys'
"He's probably also upset at Wakanda for hordeing all the vibranium"

"I don't understand what his point is though even if he is referring to Namibia. I'm from South Africa, know a bunch of guys from Namibia and they are blown away by how many people we have here. Their capital is smaller than our sixth largest city an they describe Windhoek as a ghost town compared to Johannesburg...in terms of access thats a lot easier to manage. Still, if Americans are willing to stop ignoring Africa like we're a disease ridden hopeless lump of land that only deserves to have babies adopted, aid delivered and offer compliments I guess I'll put my annoyance at Trump aside..."
"Is it sad that I just shrug off this sort of thing? These screw-ups have become the new norm, and I'm becoming completely desensitized to them. "
"Susan Collin's was not going to support the skinny repeal regardless of pressure, and while she deserves as much credit as McCain and Murkowski, she was the most reliable of Republican votes against the bill. \n\n"
"And you can be assured that many Trump fans are currently plotting violence against her. That's how they roll."
"The majority of people in this country can't thank you enough, Senator Collins!"
'That title makes no sense... she did vote against it. '
'Although there was undoubtedly a lot of pressure, Collins and Murkowski were effectively allowed to vote no because the republicans knew they still had 50 with Pence the tie breaker. I wonder if either would have wavered if McCain had been a definitive no from the beginning. '
'Yeah, no shit.'
'McCain overcame intense pressure. Overcoming>withstanding'
'Can Donald fire her?'

"How come no other media outlets are talking about this? I'm actually curious."
'Can anyone explain how the Affordable Care Act was "such a disaster" other than Republicans vehemently rejected it and it turned out to better the lives of millions of people when it passed?'
'Cut Military by 25% and would have more than enough to have affordable health-care. '
'These are not health care bills. These are insurance bills and laws. They are not designed for health, they are designed to prop up and feed the insurance companies. '
'Insurance in itself is a scam. Insurers drive up the prices of Healthcare services for those who are uninsured. Healthcare used to be affordable out of pocket before Health Insurance existed.'
"This removes protections for pre-existing conditions and let's insurers charge sick people more.\n\nI already pay almost $10k in premiums and deductables. I am on dialysis which makes you feel like shit, but I still have to work 40 hours a week to survive. Great now I suppose I'll work more hours to pay for this shit and have no life outside of dialysis and work.\n\nThanks GOP.

"I just can't understand the mindset of these people. I mean the source is obviously leftwing, so is there something that is being left out? Cause this flat out seems like something that is 100% bad for the American people and only benefits insurance companies. Like, is there something not being mentioned, or is it politicians taking bribes and being such sociopaths that they are willingly condemning 100s/1000s or more to death to get richer? Or is it just they hate Obama so much that they want to make something that is 180% different that what the former president was going for?"
'This is bad '
'No Shareblue, they aren\'t doing anything in secret. Republicans haven\'t been able to actually do anything in "secret" all year.  '
'> That’s not all. Under this new plan, insurance companies would be allowed to discriminate against pre-existing conditions — something Obamacare prohibits. \n\nSo essentially combined with everything being "preconditions" means insurances don\'t have to insure people they take money from.

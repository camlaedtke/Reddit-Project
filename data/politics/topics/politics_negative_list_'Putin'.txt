"I'm usually not a fan of ridiculous expressions of patriotism or nationalism. But this is different. This is defending our nation from a hostile foreign power. Dems need to own this patriotism and use to take back what it means to be a patriot. "
"This is just despicable. The so called patriotic party (Republicans) didn't even join in. In all honesty, if you're a republican and you've ever spouted that nonsense that others aren't patriotic enough, look at your own politicians! They should be ashamed of themselves. Such a disgusting party needs to be voted out. "

If he had an R beside his name would republicans pretend the spy allegations are "democrat witchhunts"? It doesn\'t make sense to me that someone could illegally and traitorously cheat their way to become president and be shielded from consequence. Not that anything is proven if Trump did in fact do that, but it\'s harder to believe he didn\'t based on his actions like this here. \n\nI don\'t know if Trump did collude with Russia, but even a Russian spy wouldn\'t be this obvious. It would be really funny if Mueller finds nothing connecting to Trump directly and Trump just pretended to be unable to say negative things about Putin to lure everyone with a brain into thinking there\'s kompromat, setting himself up to erode the public\'s trust into "MSM" later when Mueller doesn\'t find anything. \n\n\n '

In international relations, he consistently praises brutal strongmen while heaping scorn on democratic leaders.\n\n>So of course he hates the international institutions created by an infinitely wiser generation of U.S. statesmen, who understood that it was in America’s own interest to use its power with respect and restraint, to bind itself by rules to win the world’s trust.\n\n>He may complain that other countries are cheating and taking advantage of America, that they’re imposing unfair tariffs or failing to pay their share of defense costs. But as I said, those claims are made in bad faith — they’re excuses, not real grievances. He doesn’t want to fix these institutions. He wants to destroy them.'

This is a loophole which is clearly being abused and needs to be closed," Browder told EUobserver on Sunday (21 October).\n\nAnyone particularly familiar with this willing to elaborate on this?

This is most likely an automated error, that should be undone as soon as possible.\n\nIf France puts someone on the list, you'd want the visa to get flagged immediately, which means it's likely done by design. It would be bad PR and they would gain nothing from doing it manually, so Occam's razor should tell you to not jump to conclusions, and give this story a couple of days to develop first."

It was at that meeting that Papadopoulos first informed Trump and the then candidate’s other foreign policy advisers that he had contacts in Britain who could arrange a summit between the GOP candidate and Putin.\n> \n> Although one of the campaign officials present, J.D.

'Trump met with Putin during a time when the US media, and *only* the US media, was banned from covering him. Nothing says "I\'m innocent" like hiding from your own country\'s reporters.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/christinawilkie/status/929201900477734912'
'Trump is just flat out admitting he sides with a foreign adversary over the institutions of his own country.  \n\nWe are so fucked.\n'
'> "I think he is very insulted by it," Trump added.\n\nOh that is fucking RICH.'
'This is insane.\n\n>"I mean, give me a break, they are political hacks," Trump said. "So you look at it, I mean, you have Brennan, you have Clapper and you have Comey. Comey is proven now to be a liar and he is proven now to be a leaker. So you look at that and you have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he had nothing to do with them."'

'It’s treason, then...'
"What a shock that Trump believes whatever his boss tells him. I wonder how it feels for Trump to know he's Putin's bitch."
'He makes these comments about people who have served on Veteran’s Day, no less. '
"[Kremlin said they didn't even talk about election meddling.](https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/929327935131209730)\n\nSo, trump's just deflecting?  Manufacturing a narrative?  Either way, seems suspicious.  "
"But Trump lies all the time, so would this suggest that he doesn't actually believe him? Am I witnessing 3d chess unfolding, or just a puppet taking orders? I think I'm gonna go with the latter."
"of course he does. he's Putin's tiny-handed bitch"
"As if it wasn't any more clear that Trump is compromised. "
'Putin is moving on Trump like a bitch.  And when you’re the president of Russia, he lets you do it.'
"A president who believes his enemy over his own intelligence agencies is a traitor and one and the same as the enemy. It's insane that this person is the commander in chief. It must be incredibly demoralizing for the intelligence agencies to have a boss that completely disregards their expertise because it might diminish president thin skin's election win. Country be damned."
'What a goddam traitor!'
'Remember that time the Republicans started impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton because he lied about a blowjob?\n\n\nYou should.  You should remember it and vote these traitors out of office.  '
'He is so blatantly compromised it’s not even funny anymore '
'Yet [Putin says Trump never brought up anything about election meddling](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/359892-trump-wont-argue-with-putin-over-election-interference).  Another lie by a compulsive liar.  '
"Grass is green, sky is blue, Trump lies. This isn't news anymore, right?"

'And now Putin denies that Trump even asked him.'
"GOP: Doesn't look like anything to me"
"So Romney is vindicated now for suggesting this in 2012? He stood no chance against Obama's second term, but people were a bit harsh in dismissing his assessment of Russia."
'No way Trump will get on board. He intends to eat the meal he ordered: a Big Vlad with no bun. '
'Too bad we have a delusional traitor at the helm and a gang of sycophants that have fallen quietly and surely in line. *cries*'
'We need to be talking more about the sanctions Trump refuses to apply to Russia. \n\nIt’s so blatantly obvious he’s Putin’s Bitch. '
"TWO DECADES!?\n\nBullshit.\n\nWe should've been giving even worst sanctions to Russia all this time. They deserve the same treatment North Korea gets on a daily basis."
'We need to be talking more about the sanctions Trump refuses to apply to Russia.\n\nIt’s so blatantly obvious he’s Putin’s Bitch'
'The report notes that Nordic states have largely been immune to Russian influence because... to put it in plain English... their people aren’t idiots who take fake news at face value.'
">Detailing Two Decades of Putin's Attacks on Democracy\n\nOh, so he wrote the new GOP playbook for them?"
'Russia needs to receive the North Korea / Cuba treatment.    Complete ban on travel and trade.   To advance our interests, we should negotiate trade deals with the Netherlands, Germany, and Belarus, three of the top four trade partners of Russia.   Multilateral  negotiations with China, Indonesia, south korea, France, the Netherlands, Germany, and the US to offset the impact of the reduced trade can make this a reality.    \n\nThen,  Belarus and Turkey can be politically pressured into joining the embargo.\n\nPutin would be fucked.'
'Why on earth would Republicans want to change the rigged system that allows them to be elected?'
">Reduce European Dependence on Russian Energy Sources: Payments\nto state-owned Russian energy companies fund the\nKremlin’s military aggression abroad, as well as overt and covert\nactivities that undermine democratic institutions and social\ncohesion in Europe and the United States. The U.S. government\nshould use its trade and development agencies to support\nstrategically important energy diversification and integration\nprojects in Europe. In addition, the U.S. government should\ncontinue to oppose the construction of Nord Stream 2, a project\nwhich significantly undermines the long-term energy security\nof Europe and the economic prospects of Ukraine. \n\nI'd like to see Europe get on board with this but so far they've been resistant.  France in particular has been very critical of US sanctions as has Germany.  Unfortunately with Trump representing the US I don't see anyway they're going to even give him the time of day to address these issues."
"Finally, someone who's willing to recognize the Russian threat! "
"Republicans will block this because Russia's plans to destroy American democracy might benefit them somewhat in the short-term."
"Let's start by arresting every Republican that is willfully aiding and abetting their attacks on American democracy."
"I've gotten into so many arguments on Reddit every time I bring up that this has been going on for at least 20 years. I know because I work in cyber security and have served on multiple voting technology boards until I finally walked away, realizing that people didn't want to hear the truth. I'll keep saying it - the US elections *can not be trusted*. And don't even start on 'paper ballots'. Not the answer. WE NEED RISK LIMIT AUDITS EVERYWHERE."

"Hey he may be attacking democracy but at least he's got that hot bod"
"The only way this is going to get bipartisan support is that if Putin decides Trump just isn't worth backing and goes after the GOP for absolute chaos. "
'After revelations of confirmed guilt from the Trump campaign we are in uncharted territory. He is admitting he is in line and in league with a hostile foreign power. The fucking president. Time to call it like it is. '
'Trump: "How do you plea?"\n\nMurder suspect: "Not guilty."\n\nTrump: "well, that settles that."'
"Guess the CIA, FBI and NSA can go fuck themselves.  Your Commander in Chief takes Putin's word over yours."
'The dirt that Putin has on Trump must be real bad.'
'Not the first time that Trump has ignored intelligence.'
"By assuming this position alone and of it's self, Trump has eliminated any chance of deniability and made himself vulnerable to blackmail at the hands of the Russians. They could provide evidence, real or contrived, and Trump would look like he knew of its existence all along. As a negotiator this is a terrible position to be in. "
'Haha. America. Such a stupid country. '
"Except now Putin's office has said they didn't even discuss the election meddling. Trump lies yet again."
"Because he's guilty AF. What do you expect him to say?"
'Just to be clear, Trump sided with Putin over American FBI and CIA agents. Then he sided with Roy Moore over five women who independently accused him of pedophilia. Am I missing something here??'
'The word just out now: Kremlin is denying Trump asked Putin about Russian election interference. \n\nOh boy.'
'When is America going to wake up and realize that their own President is a traitor?  If this was the cold war he would have been tried and most likely shot by now by our own intelligence agencies'
'OMG - how fucking stupid is this guy? He’s either extremely gullible, or he’s got a BIG reason to stay on Putin’s good side. '
'Every American need to know is that trump keeps defending Russia. We then can indicate that he would not think there was anything wrong .....'
'You know how all the asshat conservatives cried “why don’t you just move to Russia” when anyone mentioned single payer healthcare? Maybe it’s time to send those fuckers off to the Russia they seem to love so much. '

"Prison time.\n\nTraitor to the US, Trump is.\n\nIt's going to take 20 years to recover from not even a year of this fool."
"I can't imagine what it's like to be in the CIA right now. If you ever needed proof that the CIA had nothing to do with JFK's death, here it is. Because if they haven't already snuffed out this traitor, there's no way they did anything to JFK."
'This definitely means Trump colluded. \n \nJudging by the pattern of his lies, this means he was most likely directly involved too. \n \nWhat an idiot.  '

"Magnitsky Act cost Putin and the people he keeps happy so he stays in power a lot of money.\n\nHe is sending a message that you do not mess with them, just look at the havoc they've created with Trump and Brexit, and the sizable body count.\n\nHe is a mob boss and will kill you."
'What\'s incredible is seeing right-wing media such as Infowars attacking Browder as a "globalist," showing how some American conservatives now act as extensions of Putin\'s policy in the US. '
'And yet Trump had to wait and think about sending an American to the enemy. '
"Honestly. That started this all. [The Magnitsky act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitsky_Act) is the Franz Ferdinand of World War 3.\n\nRussian Oligarch's money. Which is also Vladimir Putin's Money. That exact money that Putin needs to stay in power."
'I read Red Notice back before the Trump Tower meeting about "adoptions" broke in the news. It\'s clear to anyone who cares to inform themselves that Trump\'s goal has always been to eliminate sanctions and specifically the Magnitsky Act. \n\nSeeing Trump and his scum spawn attempting to negotiate a tit for tat with a brutal dictator, and knowing what Magnitsky went through in Russian prisons is about enough to make me snap. \n'

"Like anyone is even going to hold him accountable for having this man killed. Why doesn't he do it? "
'Forgive me if I seem naive, but what would Putin get out killing Browder? What does any of it accomplish? '
'Because Bill Browder bought up the previously government-owned fragments of the Soviet Union and sold them off at ridiculous prices back to the newly formed Russian Federation. Bill Browder is a piece of shit.'
"Why should I care about this guy?  He renounced his American citizenship, to do business in Russia, and not pay taxes.  Freedom isn't free, you gotta work at it."
'Putin should come visit the US. Why is he so reluctant l?'
'**FAKE NEWS** The headline contains a lie. Bill Browder has, reluctantly, testified under oath in a US court in US v. Prevezon that Magnitsky was not a lawyer and did not practice law and did not have a law degree.\n\n>In questioning by Russian investigators in 2006, Magnitsky said he was an auditor on contract with Firestone Duncan. Though Browder continued to say Magnitsky was his lawyer in this summer\'s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, two years ago, in his testimony in the US government\'s Prevezon case, Browder told a different story.\n\n>He was asked if Magnitsky had a law degree in Russia.\n>>"I\'m not aware that he did," \nBrowder said. Did he know if Magnitsky "went to law school?"\n>>"No,"\nBrowder answered.\n\nhttps://www.sott.net/article/373799-Bill-Browder-Criminal-con-man-liar-Magnitsky-Act-agitator-and-the-man-who-made-Russiagate-possible\n\n'

"Of course he hasn't, he is a fucking bot executing a fucking program. This is infuriating"
'I have a feeling that at the meeting with Putin, or shortly thereafter, he will openly say that he doesn’t believe the indictment and that we still don’t know who hacked the DNC. Whether the phase “he says he didn’t do it!” comes up or not will be interesting to see. '
'Fat Joffrey is an international embarrassment '
"I don't understand why we would ask this. \n\nNot only is it against Russian law to extradite but these are military personnel operating on direct orders to commit an act of war against us, their enemy. \n\nThis is not a criminal matter but a political one. The indictment against them in our courts is a formality that will never proceed through the system. \n\nWe shouldn't **ask** Putin a bloody thing, we should retaliate in kind and hard. Any other action will be read as weakness and permission to continue. "
'Every time he says something this ridiculous,  I ask myself - \n\n"Imagine the uproar if a Democrat had said that"'
"Trump isn't in a position to ask for anything, he's in a position to take orders or face Russia burning him, leading to his impeachment and life in prison. "
'Trump - Obama let Russia annex Crimea & meddle in our election. No Collusion!\n\nThe Press - So are you going to hold Putin accountable during your summit?\n\nTrump - I haven\'t thought about it.\n\nI remember when the GOP accused Obama of practicing "appeasement" & "leading from behind ". Trump is the weakest President in my lifetime. He has no interest in keeping the country safe,  only lining his pockets and pandering to his base. '
'All those witch hunt tweets take all the thought process Trump can handle?'

"Not much thinking going on in the white house nowadays, huh... At least he's honest.\n\n**Edit: He's not honest either. Whoops"
"Well mr. Trump now that it's been brought to your attention, you have no excuse.  Who am I kidding, he'll just blame Obama or something."
"When #45 isn't even concerned about any of these indictments, he just yells even louder how much he should not be trusted, **PERIOD**"
"Of course he didn't. Trump is a Russian asset. If he asks Putin, Putin will say he didn't do it. Trump will believe him, and go back to attacking Obama. Unfortunately, these indicted Russians will never see the inside of an American court"
"Isn't this some kind of abdication of duty? Isn't he compelled by the oath of office to follow up with finding by the independent counsel even if he disagrees with said findings?\nDid Obama ever say such outlandish, politically hostile statements where he simply disregarded an official finding from a US institution or branch of government? I'm truly confused how we can allow a sitting president to say these things. Not just this, but everything the past several months."
'He\'s said on Twitter "individuals" and not agents, spies, officials, etc. Hes either too fucking dumb to differentiate them, or he doesnt see them as criminals.'

'He didn\'t get the memo to use "Zionist" or "Globalist" instead?  Or is he just not caring to use a dog whistle at this time?'
'For me, this is as good as an outright admission of guilt. Why try to muddy the waters by blaming the Jews if you can just say, "No, there was no attempt by the Russian government to interfere in the US election"?'
'Fuck this time line. '
"ah that's why we have had so many damn jewish presidents, it all adds up now"
'Did NBC ask him about poisoning people with nerve agents?'
"I mean an organized effort by an enemy state is no big deal right? I'm sure Putin will reassure Trump that they didn't do anything and that should be the end of it."

'A distraction is coming. You heard it here first. '
"There's really two options that I see. They either cancel outright or they demand a change of format that reflects the fact that Russia is now officially a nation that attacked our last election process with their military. If they cancel rather than accept the changes, that's fine.\n\nAnd, of course, no meeting with other Americans in the room under any circumstances. That would be wildly inappropriate considering the current president's party was the confirmed beneficiary of the attack on our country.\n\nThis is what a responsible leader would do."
"Cancel it?\n\nPutins throbbing member isn't going to be sucking itself this september!"
'This is the same play as him saying Merritt Garland should be the next Supreme Court Justice. It will never happen,  and is just projecting incredulity. \n\nThe Democratic leadership is just trying to get their names out there with limp statements that will never have results. He knows this statement does nothing but just that. It doesn’t change anybody’s opinion. Maybe he’ll get a rise out of Trump but who can’t do that?  \n\nThey really need some younger blood in there. Schumer and Pelosi seem to be just banking on outrage as a platform for the midterms. \n\nThey could route the Republicans if they had a solid platform other than being upset about Trump.'
"Isn't reverse psychology better for a narcissist?\n\n\nI don't think Trump has the guts to cancel a meeting with Putin etc etc"
'What a fucking puppet.  Our President is in bed with Russia.  He does not care about America, only himself and money.  '

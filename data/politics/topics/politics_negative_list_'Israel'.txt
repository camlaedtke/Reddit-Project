'Security clearances are denied for very minor things. This guy has one and they are still revealing shit he didn\'t disclose and/or purposefully withheld. At what point do intelligence agencies step in and say "Hey we aren\'t going to share anything as long as this guy is in the room." He is a threat to National Security.'
'At this rate/this time next week:  Jared Kushner failed to disclose his real name, date of birth, address, and the fact he owns shares in all the businesses Putin owns.'
'Oh, look. Its another "Jared Kushner failed to disclose" article.'
"Kush has to be absolutely terrified right now, knowing that Flynn flipped and very possibly on him. If I had done 1/10 of what Kush did, I would be in jail and I think he's headed there and he knows it. And that helps me be a little happy in all this insanity. "
'IS there a running list somewhere of all the things Jared has failed to declare?'
"Guys so what, he's only leading a foundation funding an ongoing war crime.\n\nWhat can't these guys do wrong?"
'Gee, it almost seems like a crime has been committed.'
'Kushner tomorrow\n\n"Ohhhh.... those illegal Israeli settlements I was funding"'
'Jared "failed to disclose" Kushner'
"oh israel? isn't it impossible to do anything wrong related to israel as long as our taxpayers bends over backwards to serve them"
'Israeli collusion? Shock, awe.\n\nConsidering how much funding the states gives them, makes one think about the strings guiding the puppets. '

'Donald Trump is planning to announce a formal recognition of all of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on Wednesday, which would make it official that the United States, as a country, no longer recognizes Israeli land grabs as inherently illegal. While not all Israeli settlements are in Jerusalem, the thing that makes Israeli settlements illegal is that they are constructed by the Israeli government in parts of Palestine that were seized during the 1967 war -- including the entire Eastern half of Jerusalem, which was governed by Jordan until the war, was not intended to be divided, and has always been recognized by Palestinians as part of their nation and future state. \n\nSo by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel -- all of Jerusalem -- Donald Trump is essentially saying, officially, that the United States government will ignore one of the most central aspects of international law -- respect for borders and opposition to the conquest of land during war -- when it comes to a close US ally. Up until this point, the ardently pro-Israel Congress had repeatedly demanded the President recognize Jerusalem as the capital, and all US presidents have refused to do so out of "national security" -- i.e., that it would undermine any semblance of American commitment to international law and the international order and would make any sort of peace agreement about the future of Israel/Palestine impossible. Trump has no respect for such an order, and America\'s allies in the Arab world have never actually given a shit about the Palestinians or the beliefs of their own people anyway, so he may throw all of that to the wind. \n\nIn that sense, as much as it is ridiculous that Kushner (and Flynn and Dermer) have all advocated for Israeli settlement construction in ways that are either ridiculous or violate US law, the problem isn\'t limited to these individuals. The entire administration is married to Israeli abuses and will do anything it can to legitimate them out of pandering to domestic pro-Israel supporters. \n\nThese things can\'t be predicted but it may trigger an intifada, as well as massive upheavals throughout the Middle East and it could also trigger a further push away from the United States by other nations. \n\nThis is not a small thing. It\'s not really about Jerusalem or Palestine (which are big things in their own right). It\'s about whether or not America even cares about pretending to value international law when it governs much of the world. '

'At this point, any evidence of collusion with Russia would just be icing on the cake for investigators. Trump‚Äôs inner circle systematically and deliberately tried to deceive their way into possession of top level security clearances, and if Trump is to be believed, he obstructed justice knowing his unqualified buddies tried to cheat the system. After campaigning on Clinton‚Äôs careless disregard for national security procedures, the fact that the Trump transition immediately went to work incriminating themselves with the same arrogant attitude is just delicious.'
'>"Every successive failure to disclose his financial holdings makes it harder and harder to believe Jared Kushner isn\'t trying to intentionally deceive the American people,"\xa0Pat Dennis, the group‚Äôs research director, told\xa0Newsweek.

SCI information refers to so-called "code word" information with obtuse names such as Blue Igloo, Senior Ferry, etc. \n\nThis is a huge negative impact to any White House staff to serve effectively, as almost all Presidential intelligence briefs contain T/S and SCI data.

"You know what would be nice, just 1 politician that wasn't shifty as fuck"
'I went through the security clearance process, again, last year for a routine update.  I asked my interviewer if I could like like Kushner and keep my clearance.  The reply was that if I lied at 1/100 of the amount, I would be escorted out of the secured area, and wait charges for lying.'
"With any luck Kushner will be indicted soon, which I think will utterly tear the white House apart. Bannon has been whispering in Trump's ear this whole time about how much he dislikes Kushner, however Trump also loves his daughter very much...I feel like a Kushner indictment would really light a tinderbox of WH drama.

"I know Cult 45 members love the president, but what do they think of his team? Are they on board with Kushner too? Maybe since it generate liberal tears it's OK? "

"> Even by the standards of Apollo, one of the world’s largest private equity firms, the previously unreported transaction with the Kushners was a big deal: It was **triple the size** of the average property loan made by Apollo’s real estate lending arm, securities filings show.\n\n> Apollo made the loan to Kushner Companies on Nov. 1, 2017, according to public records.\n\n> It was one of the largest loans Kushner Companies received last year. An even larger loan came from Citigroup, which lent the firm and one of its partners $325 million to help finance a group of office buildings in Brooklyn.\n\n> That loan was made in the spring of 2017, shortly after Mr. Kushner met in the White House with Citigroup’s chief executive, Michael L. Corbat, according to people briefed on the meeting. The two men talked about financial and trade policy and did not discuss Mr. Kushner’s family business, one person said.\n\n-\n\n> Apollo does not make real estate loans directly. Instead, it makes them through a so-called real estate investment trust, called Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance. The trust is a publicly traded company with its own set of shareholders. It is managed by Apollo, which charges the trust management fees, and has no employees of its own.\n\n> One of the largest investors in Apollo’s real estate trust is the Qatari government’s investment fund, **the Qatar Investment Authority.**\n\nQatari Investment Authority is also one of the holders of that [19.5 percent stake in Rosneft](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-rosneft-privatisation-insight/how-russia-sold-its-oil-jewel-without-saying-who-bought-it-idUSKBN1582OH), it's worth pointing out.\n\n-\n\n> Mr. Kushner resigned as chief executive of Kushner Companies when he joined the White House last January, and he sold a small portion of his stake in the company to a trust controlled by his mother.\n\n> But he retained the vast majority of his interest in Kushner Companies. \n\n> Public filings show that Mr. Kushner still owns part of the company that received the Apollo loan. The loan was used to refinance a Chicago skyscraper that is the Midwest headquarters for AT&T. Mr. Kushner also still holds a stake in the entity that owns the Brooklyn buildings and received the loan from Citigroup.\n\nQuid pro quo:\n\n> Apollo has sought ways to benefit from the White House’s possible infrastructure plan. And its executives, including Mr. Harris, had tens of millions of dollars personally at stake in the tax overhaul that was making its way through Washington last year.\n\n> Shortly after Kushner Companies received the loan from Apollo, the private equity firm emerged as a beneficiary of the tax cut package that the White House championed. Mr. Trump backed down from his earlier pledge to close a loophole that permits private equity managers to pay taxes on the bulk of their income at rates that are roughly half of ordinary income tax rates. The tax law left the loophole largely intact.\n\n> Citigroup, one of the country’s largest banks, is heavily regulated by federal agencies and, like other financial companies, is trying to get the government to relax its oversight of the industry."
"> The job never materialized [for the private equity billionaire from Apollo], but in November, Apollo lent $184 million to Mr. Kushner’s family real estate firm, Kushner Companies. The loan was to refinance the mortgage on a Chicago skyscraper.\n\n> Even by the standards of Apollo, one of the world’s largest private equity firms, the previously unreported transaction with the Kushners was a big deal: It was triple the size of the average property loan made by Apollo’s real estate lending arm, securities filings show.\n\n> It was one of the largest loans Kushner Companies received last year. The largest came from Citigroup, which lent the firm and one of its partners $325 million to help finance a group of office buildings in Brooklyn.\n\nhe meets two bank guys in the white house (one guy he discusses a possible job) for massive loans: 'ethics - i don't need no stinking ethics!'

"This dorky kid who can't seem to follow instructions on important forms has been tasked by the POTUS to:\n\n\n1. Jared Kushner is responsible for negotiating peace in the Middle East.\nTrump has tasked Kushner with brokering “a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.” “If you can’t produce peace in the Middle East, nobody can,” Trump told Kushner at an inauguration event.\n\n\n2. Jared Kushner is responsible for solving America’s opioid epidemic.\nKushner will be responsible for crafting a strategy to combat “opioid abuse, a regular emphasis for Trump on the campaign trail.” He will oversee a commission devoted to the topic that will be headed by Chris Christie.\n\n\n3. Jared Kushner is responsible for diplomacy with Mexico.\nWhen Trump was set to deliver a speech on the border wall, Kushner, consulting with Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, re-wrote the speech “to make it less damaging” to bilateral relationships with Mexico. Kushner then went to the Oval Office to brief Trump on the changes, which he ultimately agreed to. Mexican officials told CBS News that “Kushner is now handling everything between the two countries, and personally trying to keep the relationship from disintegrating further.”\n\n\n4. Jared Kushner is responsible for diplomacy with China.\nKushner is the administration’s point person for diplomacy on China. He had repeatedly met with Chinese diplomats. The New York Times reports that “heavily involved in planning the presidential visit [of Xi Jinping], a senior official said, and took part in a National Security Council meeting… at which North Korea and China were discussed.”\n\n\n5. Jared Kushner is responsible for reforming care for veterans.\nKushner will also dedicate time to “reimagining Veterans Affairs.” This was also a top priority for Trump on the trail, who repeatedly pledged to take better care of veterans.\n\n\n6. Jared Kushner is responsible for reforming the criminal justice system.\nKushner traveled to the Capital building this week to represent the administration in a discussion of criminal justice reform with two key Senators, Buzzfeed reported.\n\n\n7. Jared Kushner is responsible for reinventing the entire government and making it work like a business.\nTrump recently put Kushner in charge of the “White House Office of American Innovation.” The new office “is designed to infuse fresh thinking into Washington, float above the daily political grind and create a lasting legacy for a president.” It’s task, according to Kushner is to make the entire U.S. government “run like a great American company.”\n\n\nGod helps us."
"Ivanka and Jared both learned to be crooks from their fathers.  Nothing is a mistake.  They likely aren't the most intelligent people on the planet but they know some tricks to play the system.  Ivanka is NEVER going to go against daddy dearest because he loves her the most (and wants to fuck her the most) and she knows how much she will inherit.  She will NEVER put that money in jeopardy!  I laugh at people who think that she will try to reason with her father.  I am sure that she knows exactly how to manipulate him, but she only does so for her own purpose."

'I truly believe that the intelligence community has more than enough evidence to lock up Trump, much of his campaign staff, and some prominent Republicans. But had they done that all at once, especially soon after the election, it would have seemed like a coup. So instead they slowly leak out all this info one piece at a time. Plus the more Trump talks/tweets the more he incriminates himself and proves he is a liar. By the time the real charges start dropping at least half the country will be saying "about time!" and another 40% won\'t like it but will begrudgingly accept it because the evidence is too strong. The remaining 10% will make a lot of noise but won\'t be enough to cause any sort of insurrection. \n\nThis is also why I believe that Pence will get away with his part in all of this, and so will any senior GOP staff.

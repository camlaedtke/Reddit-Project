'> The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has subpoenaed the Trump Organization to turn over documents, including some related to Russia, according to two people briefed on the matter. The order is the first known time that the special counsel demanded documents directly related to President Trump’s businesses, bringing the investigation closer to the president.\n\nSo about that red line...'
"He is subpoenaing then instead of asking because if he subpoenas and trump fires him, it won't matter. The subpoena would still stand and Trump would still have to provide them. 99% sure he is going to claim executive privilege and say he doesn't have to provide docs (which is horseshit of course and if we really want to go to the precedent Nixon was subpoenaed for docs and had to comply - thanks for all the precedent republicans!).\n\nEdit: I should have been clearer - I don't think executive privielge applies at all. That's why I called it horseshit in my original comment. I just think the stable genius will try to use it because he's desperate and stupid. We are talking about these people: Sessions who used executive privilege for things that happened before trump was elected claiming that he might use it sometime in the future so I can't answer your question, Trump jr who tried to use attorney client communications confidentiality when talking to Non-attorneys. These people are stupid and desperate and will claim whatever defense they can whether applicable or not. That's what I was saying. And even if they claim it, which they will, Nixon already set a precedent where a president must comply with at least a doc request subpoena. "
'>"Mr. Mueller could run afoul of a red line the president has warned him not to cross. Though it is not clear how much of the subpoena is related to Mr. Trump’s business beyond ties to Russia, Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times in July that the special counsel would be crossing a “red line” if he looked into his family’s finances beyond any relationship with Russia. The president declined to say how he would respond if he concluded that the special counsel had crossed that line."\n\n"Try me." - Mueller'

'> The Trump Organization has said that it never had real estate holdings in Russia, but witnesses recently interviewed by Mr. Mueller have been asked about a possible real estate deal in Moscow. In 2015, a longtime business associate of Mr. Trump’s emailed Mr. Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen at his Trump Organization account claiming he had ties to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and said that building a Trump Tower in Moscow would help Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign.\n\n> Mr. Trump signed a nonbinding “letter of intent” for the project in 2015 and discussed it three times with Mr. Cohen.\n\n[CNN last year obtained documents detailing this plan.](https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/08/politics/document-trump-tower-moscow/index.html).

And if they did name it after Trump\'s daughter, then Ivanka or her designee would be given "sole and absolute discretion" to approve "all interior design elements of the spa or fitness facilities," the document says.\n\n-\n\nBack to the NYT report:\n\n> The breadth of the subpoena was not clear, nor was it clear why Mr. Mueller issued it instead of simply asking for the documents from the company, an umbrella organization that oversees Mr. Trump’s business ventures. \n\nProbably because he knew they would just say no.'
"Translation: Mueller has evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, and is politely giving them an opportunity to fuck themselves over.\n\nhe doesn't subpoena something unless he ~~already knows~~ could prove it a month ago.\n\nedit:\n\n> Mr. Mueller appears to be broadening his investigation to examine the role foreign money may have played in funding Mr. Trump’s political activities.\n\nOh, that's a paddlin.'"

Trump owes the bank about $300m in loans that were extended to him before he became president.\n\n>The Guardian reported in February that the bank had launched a review of Trump’s account earlier this year to gauge whether there were any connections to Russia and had not discovered anything suspicious.\n\n>Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and adviser in the White House; her husband, Jared Kushner, who is also a presidential adviser; and Kushner’s mother, Seryl Stadtmauer, are all clients of Deutsche Bank.'

'The title of this could easily be “If Trump sneezes, we must impeach” and get upvotes.'
"Mueller isn't fishing with a rod. He is fishing with a net. He probably has trump, he likely has key family members and members of the administration. That's a small number of fish and he is going for the school, not the individual fish.  The Republican party is beyond complacent, they facilitated this and that means the whole school of fish needs to come down. They won't allow for impeachment because they have skin in the game and Mueller got to where he is by being a few steps ahead of the best. They fire Mueller and my guess is the trap is set they seal their own fate."

Family and friends be damned, this is not what I believe in and it is not what I stand for, it will be the toughest and scariest decision of my life, but I'll make that sacrifice."

'This is important to note because it comes at a time when the GOP believes in polling again. '

'Who cares what Americans think - what really matters is what the Kochs and Putin want.'

Just make an accurate title.'
"I think a better polling question might be.\n\n> What are willing to do if the President fires Mueller before testifying under oath?\n\n> 1. Nothing\n> 2. Become more politically active\n> 3.

Yes, he said if Trump did interview, he was a loser."

'51% are Republicans! His support continues to erode!'
"Of course. He should do what he said he'd do, and testify under oath just like Hillary did. And on TV. Or, he could show everyone that Hillary has more guts than he does. Then again, what would you expect from a 5-time draft dodger?"
'What does data like this even accomplish?\n\nIts apparent that no one cares about poll results because if they dont align with a person or parties priorities, its just fake news'
"How can Donald make this all go away? Testify. If he has nothing to hide and is genuinely unafraid, then this'll be a walk in the park. Of course, such is not the case. Donald speaks and acts as someone who is guilty and who knows that time is running out. They should know better than to try and push this under the rug now, this isn't going away. Mueller has the support of the majority. "
'There is close to a zero percent chance he testifies under oath voluntarily. '
'As far as I’m concerned. There’s no need for armed conflict.

The expected windfall was supposed to be a kickback for lifting economic sanctions on Russia, which has not happened because Trump's hands have been tied.

"Whatever bullshit witnesses or the president are going to try to pull out of their collective asses, Mueller is prepared for it.

They are basically protecting Trump not on the merits of his actions, but through politically slanted legal maneuver. Because screw the country as long as my side is winning, right?'

"Can we talk for a second about how amazing this investigation is being conducted? Mueller asked the Trump team to turn over their emails.

No one will ever be appointed if that is the precedent because “investigations” of the President are the new norm. \n\nLet’s let the investigation conclude and go from there. Yes it would be nice if it was faster. Yes it sucks that Trump is appointing judges that I don’t agree with while the investigation is ongoing.

'For a supposedly innocent man, he sure is acting awfully guilty.'
"That doesn't reek of guilt at all. /s"
"Where are the trump supporters? Don't they want to defend Donnie?"
">That suggests that the press as a whole has not done a good job of actually conveying factual information to our audience, that Democrats’ messaging on the investigation has not been clear enough on the most damning point (**Trump, even if otherwise innocent, is guilty of hiring crooks and trying to prevent an investigation into their activity**), and that Trump’s counterstrategy of muddying the waters around the investigation has been fairly successful.\n\nBest case scenario for Trump: he is an idiot surrounded by crimminals who take advantage of him. Not the image of a great leader at all.\n\nBut the best evidence of Trump's guilt is his own behaviour. If he were innocent and he were not aware on the crimes commited by his own people, he would not be attacking the investigation. That's not how innocent people behave. If you fear an investigation, that's because you have something to hide."

'But trump supporters told me he would release his taxes. I wonder why. '
'This is the question being asked first...\n\n> "As you may know there is currently an investigation going on right now into Donald Trump\'s 2016 presidential campaign and any Russian government involvement in the 2016 election. How much have you heard about this investigation?"\n\n49% said, they\'ve "heard a lot" and 32% sayd they\'ve "heard some". Compare that to 59% that say that "No" crimes have been uncovered.\n\nMy guess here is that they heard "Donald Trump\'s 2016 presidential campaign" and to most people that is synonymous with Donald Trump the person. They don\'t realize that it also includes people who were part of the campaign. \n\nIf both of the questions were reworded, it might have a slightly better results.\n\nThis either underscores how little people pay attention (to the survey and the news) or how little they understand about politics. My guess is, it\'s both.'

'The WSJ article in question: https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-lawyers-aim-to-decide-by-may-17-whether-president-testifies-in-mueller-probe-1525727774\n\nWASHINGTON—Lawyers advising President Donald Trump in the Russia investigation hope to decide whether he should testify by May 17, the one-year anniversary of the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani said Monday.\n\nMr. Trump’s legal team has long been divided on whether he should agree to a sit-down interview with Mr. Mueller, a decision that exposes him to legal perils but also could hasten the end of an investigation that has shadowed his presidency.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Giuliani said, “every day we swing a little different” on whether to advise Mr. Trump to talk to Mr. Mueller, though he suggested that recent developments in the probe have made him more leery.\n\nThe president’s initial position was “what do I have to lose? I’m telling the truth,” Mr. Giuliani said. But Mr. Trump has also promised to weigh his lawyers’ advice.\n\nIn a tweet on Monday, Mr. Trump made clear his displeasure with the prosecutors running the Russia probe, describing them as “13 Angry Democrats.” He went on to suggest he might raise an issue with the courts about “unrevealed conflicts of interest” inside the Mueller team.\n\nMr. Mueller, a registered Republican, has served under presidents of both parties, including 12 years as FBI director after being named to that post by then President George W. Bush, a Republican. His team includes many Democrats, some of whom contributed to Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump’s opponent in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMr. Mueller is investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential race. He is also examining whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice in firing FBI Director James Comey a year ago. Mr. Trump has denied any collusion or obstruction, while Russia has denied interfering in the election.\n\nMr. Trump’s legal team has undergone a makeover over the past two months, with Mr. Giuliani now assuming the dominant public role.\n\nThe mix of lawyers could influence Mr. Trump’s ultimate decision, given their differing views on the merits of an interview. John Dowd, once the lead outside attorney who opposed an interview, resigned from the team.\n\nBut Mr. Trump is also losing Ty Cobb, the lawyer handling the Russia probe inside the White House. Mr. Cobb has been more open to the prospect of an interview under certain conditions. The latest addition to the legal lineup is Washington lawyer Emmet Flood. Of all of them, Mr. Giuliani is closest to Mr. Trump personally.\n\nMr. Giuliani said he came into the case last month skeptical about letting Mr. Trump testify, based on his own experience as a former U.S. attorney and private lawyer.\n\n“I’m not sure any client of mine has ever testified, and I sure as heck have benefited from ones who were dumb enough to do it” when he served as a prosecutor, Mr. Giuliani said.\n\nAnother consideration is how Mr. Trump would perform as a witness and whether he has the discipline to avoid unnecessary tangents that open himself to new questions.\n\n“Anyone can see he has great difficulty staying on a subject,” one person familiar with the legal team’s deliberations said.\n\nIn his initial discussions with Mr. Mueller’s team, though, Mr. Giuliani said the prosecutors seemed “reasonable as to the ground rules.” He said he came away believing that an interview “had gone up in possibility.”\n\nSouring him, though, was a court hearing last week in which a federal judge, T.S. Ellis, questioned Mr. Mueller’s authority to bring tax and bank-fraud charges against Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. The judge, an appointee of former President Ronald Reagan, said Mr. Mueller’s aim was to squeeze Mr. Manafort for more information about Mr. Trump.\n\n“They’re not really interested in Manafort, just in trapping the president,” Mr. Giuliani said. “It shows they’ll go pretty far to trap him.”\n\nA safe course for the president is to decline to testify, Mr. Giuliani said. But such a move could set off a legal showdown if Mr. Mueller then slaps the president with a grand jury subpoena.\n\n“They [the special counsel’s team] made it easier not to testify by their improper conduct,” Mr. Giuliani said.\n\nHe added, “So, I don’t think we’d pay the same public price for not testifying that we might have before.”\n\nPreparing Mr. Trump to testify would be a serious distraction to his work as president, eating into time he needs to deal with pressing global issues, Mr. Trump’s lawyers contend.\n\n**In an informal, four-hour practice session, Mr. Trump’s lawyers were only able to walk him through two questions, given the frequent interruptions on national-security matters along with Mr. Trump’s loquaciousness, one person familiar with the matter said.**\n\nMeanwhile, the turnover has created a separate problem for Mr. Trump’s defense: His lawyers lack security clearances, which could limit the documents and materials they can see.\n\nWhen Mr. Dowd left in March, he was the only outside lawyer who held a clearance. The outside team as it now stands—Jay Sekulow, Marty and Jane Raskin and Mr. Giuliani—are all in the process of applying for security clearances, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nMr. Cobb, who works in the White House, holds a security clearance, but he plans to leave at the end of the month.\n\nLegal experts said Mr. Giuliani may struggle to get a clearance, given his consulting work on behalf of foreign countries in past years, including a Qatari state-owned oil company.\n\n—Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.'

Sure it\'s inconvenient in a lot of ways when functionaries are prevented from performing their function, and that can have real consequences for people who have something that\'s important to them which requires some act of some federal bureaucrat, I get that.

"This investigation is going to last a lot longer....the feds dont mess around and the reason they have such a high conviction rate is because they really make sure they have all their T's crossed and I's dotted.

'Richard Nixon said "When the president does it, that means it is not illegal" and Donald Trump heard him, said, "SEE?" and turned off the TV.'
'Mmmmm smells like witness tampering to me. Idk. Ask kushner. He knows all about that. '
'Speaking about witnesses who might damage his reputation, Trump said:\n\n"Well, I think that -- if all that were proven true, I think that would be a very serious offense. That is not going to be proven true. I think we\'re going to find some other things. And I think that when all of this is put into context, and we really **look** at the people involved here, look at their **motivations** and look at their **backgrounds**, look at their **past behavior**, some folks are going to have **a lot to answer for**..."\n\nNow if that\'s not threatening a smear campaign against witnesses, then I don\'t know what is.'

"Without looking up the details myself (but plenty at r/Keep_Track FYI) Paul Manafort has numerous connections to Russia, has been connected with Roger Stone for decades, has known Trump well before Trump's 2016 campaign began and, as we all know, was briefly his campaign manager. Paul may owe a Russian oligarch (that's close to Putin) millions of dollars, and is so shady his daughter's knows what's up. Either he goes to jail for the President or he flips (and if he legitimately doesn't know anything helpful to prosecuting the rest of the Trump campaign then he is certainly going to jail). It's not just the President, either; there's Pence, Donnie Jr., Jared, Ivanka, Sessions, Nunes, the Mercers, the Koch brothers, the NRA, and other mucky-mucks in the GOP. How much does he know? We're not close to being finished yet...."
'I think Mueller is rolling these charges out in a way that’s going to allow some of the people in the alternate reality to deal better. We all see the arguments getting more and more boxed in. At a certain point the more rational folks who just happen to be Fox News viewers may snap out of it. \n\nDare to dream. '
'"Uh...When we said Manafort was the Chairman of the Trump campaign, we meant that he was just in charge of the chairs. He was our chairman. He brought the foldable chairs to our rallies. Pretty much a coffee boy."'
"Mueller is like Denzel Washington in The Book of Eli, except he's protecting our constitution instead of a braille bible. "
">   The\n fact\nthat\n Manafort\n has\n not \nbeen\n able \nto find\n any\n responsible \nsurety\n to cosign\n a bond \nfor \nthis\n package \nsuggests that\n **neither\n those closest\n to\n him, nor anyone else, is\n willing\n to\n assume\n the risk\n of being a \nsurety\n for him.**\n\nHe's on his own."
"Just to be clear, Mueller didn't just discover this new small mortgage related crime... He has a whole bag of these.\n\nHe added this one on top to send a message to manafort that he will endlessly entangle him with one charge after another because he has a mountain of evidence against him, and that he either get with the program or say hello to legal battles and jail for the rest of his life. "
'Lol he is so fuckkked.'
'Trump has no admitted Russia was involved... HUGE. The fact that he is forced to admit it means the evidence is so overwhelming even he cannot attempt to deny it in his alternate reality.'
">The second reason for getting these memos — and let’s not pretend this isn’t perfectly plausible — would be to selectively leak from them, to mislead the public by, say, creating phony impressions of misconduct on Comey’s part that could provide more fodder for Trump and his allies to delegitimize the investigation, possibly manufacturing further pretext to hamstring or kill it. Let me remind you that Republicans already tried a similar caper with the bad-faith-saturated Nunes memo.\n\nAt least we're starting to preemptively call out the House Republican's BS.  Hopefully enough people are listening."
"It's because they know this investigation is heading towards all the money Russia (and, I would assume, other countries) poured into shadowy financial wing of the GOP.

'Checks and balances don’t work when a corrupt party controls all the branches.'
"I just want to know what they're getting out of this to make this worthwhile for themselves.  \n\n\nThey know Trump is up to his ears in Russian mafia and money laundering. They also know his entire campaign had connections to Russia, so they can't feel confident there wasn't collusion/conspiracy there. Basically, they have to know the investigation has merit, and yet they're still interfering. \n\nAre they being paid off? Are they being blackmailed? "
"I truly believe that the nation is beginning to lean hard left. More young people are voting and getting involved in politics due to social media.

"Remember, this is the meeting Trump was so eager to cover up that he dictated Trump Jr.'s response from Air Force One as the news broke. Hope Hicks helped Trump craft the statement and she has been interviewed by Mueller about this. The other guy that was in the room when they wrote the statement quit his job because he thought this was criminal and he was also interviewed by Mueller. This is why Mueller doesn't need to interview Trump anymore. He has just so much proof of obstruction and corrupt intent that the case is sealed. What is most telling is that Mueller skipped a slam dunk opportunity to have Trump perjure himself during the interview! This is how sure he is to indict him.

'For those genuinely interested in Special Counsel Robert Mueller\'s strategy, there was an excellent write up in *The Atlantic* about it back in October:\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/10/robert-mueller-indictments-russia/544409/\n\nThis is the most relevant take-away:\n\n> A common prosecutorial tactic in high-level white-collar and organized-crime investigations is to seek convictions for lesser crimes on the outer fringes of their main focus. The threat of long prison sentences allows investigators to extract plea deals from potential witnesses, which can then be used to bring charges against more significant targets.\n\nOr, as Richard Ben-Veniste, a member of the Watergate special-prosecutor task force put it: "I would say this is High-Level Special Counsel Investigation 101. Mueller is operating by the book."\n\nAnd for those who think that *The Atlantic* is leftist Fake News^TM, here is a write-up in the conservative *National Review* that arrives at essentially the same conclusions:\n\nhttp://www.nationalreview.com/article/454311/mueller-strategy-obstruction-justice-investigation-leading-impeachment'
"They're not panicking.  Their base doesn't really care, no matter what the news says or what the results end up being."
'Really interested to see what these texts say '
'Former state attorney general Preet Bharara recently said in his podcast that while investigating you work your way up to the main person since you usually only have one shot at it. This leads him to believe that the investigation is coming to its conclusion even though its pretty early on.'

'Looks like Mueller...\n\n*puts on shades*\n\n...has opened the Gates.'
'It is amazing how quickly Mueller is moving on all of this. '
'Every time the Russiabots try to drum up some controversy, such as "Gates fired his lawyer, he\'s not going to plea!", something like this drops.  I love it.  Mueller is Jedi fucking Master at this.'
'Happy Friday, fellow F5 Knights of New.'
"Hope you had your breakfast folks, we're getting going early today!"
'I think this might be the most significant development yet.  Can anybody think of a single reason why Mueller would allow Gates to cop a plea in exchange for cooperation *other than him providing information that directly implicates Trump and/or Trump’s associates in criminal wrongdoing*?  He has *dozens* of charges against him.  From the outside looking in, the case looks to be pretty airtight.  Manafort is the biggest target Mueller has formally indicted/charged as of right now, and he has more than enough evidence to put Manafort away for life - so he doesn’t need Gates’ help to send Manafort to a cell.  What other reason could there possibly be to let this guy off the hook unless he’s providing substantial evidence against current and/or former administration officials?  \n\nGates was involved at a high level all the way through Election Day and into the transition.  If anybody would have intimate details of the inner workings of Trump’s campaign it’d be him.  Add that to all of the crazy ass ranting that Trump has been doing over the past two weeks and it certainly seems like this is the biggest step so far in this marathon.'
'Not even 10 am and I’m served with a piping hot bowl of Mueller-oats!  Good Morning! 🌞 '
'Straight Muelldozed '
'Mueller already has the goods on Gates and Manafort, who are clearly crooks, and collecting plea deals from multiple offenders appears to reveal larger objectives in the investigation.\n\nIt feels like a tsunami is building.\n\n'
'I’m interested to see what Manafort does with all of this.  On federal charges, he is royally fucked, and he may be hoping for a Presidential pardon.  I’m wondering if Mueller is waiting for Trump to flinch and show his cards to either pardon Manafort or distance himself from him.  Mueller then can either say, the President is distancing himself from you, are you sure you want life in prison for protecting this asshole?  Or if the President is talking pardon, Mueller drops a bunch of state charges through the NY AG (people who avoid paying fed taxes most likely don’t pay state taxes too).  At that point, Manafort is truly Manafucked, and the obstruction case against Trump gets that much stronger....'

In the district for this case Mueller was required to go to the judge/court to ask for them.\n\n>A cautious litigant will obtain all of the subpoenas they could possibly need so they can send them out if you’re going to trial.

'So will Mueller submit multiple choice questions or just True or False questions?  '
'Looks like Trump is trying to burn any evidence left. '
'> In addition to the possibility of suggesting the president submit written responses in place of an interview, a second person familiar with the president’s legal strategy said another possibility being contemplated was an affidavit signed by the president affirming he was innocent of any wrongdoing and denying any collusion.\n\nNO COLLUSION!!!!\n- Signed, zig zag zig zag zig zag'
'Question...is there any legal way for Mueller to *make* the president of the United States sit down to an interview?'
'> “Prosecutors want to see and hear folks in person,” said Chuck Rosenberg, former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia and chief of staff to FBI Director Comey. “They want to probe and follow up. Body language and tone are important,” said Rosenberg, now an NBC News analyst. “And they want answers directly from witnesses, not from their lawyers. The odds of prosecutors agreeing to written responses are somewhere between infinitesimally small and zero." \n\nI think a three-year-old could pretty well write out exactly what trump\'s lawyers/trump himself would say on a written affidavit. \n\nThat his lawyers think he could get away with not being interviewed face to face is absolutely ridiculous. At some point, his lawyers are going to have to face a "return on investment" situation, and bail on him. Where is that line going to be? They\'re all making fools of themselves.'

'Hopefully the first question was "what the fuck\'s the deal with your name?"'
'He offered. rofl. I bet he skipped in with bells on.\n'
'God Speed Robert Mueller... '
'Lordy I hope they did.'
"Relevant to all this is Reagan's [11th Commandment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eleventh_Commandment_(Ronald_Reagan)):\n\n> Thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican.\n\nThe question here is, *does Priebus consider Trump a Republican?*"
'probably has more to do with the obstruction of justice part of the investigation than the collusion part.'
"That's pretty high up the food chain, so we shouldnt have that much longer to go, right?"
'I think we all need to be praying that Rinsed Penis gets home safe and sound each and every night.\n\n9 months ago I would have laughed at the suggestion that "24" got some of the seedier conspiracy stuff right.\n\nNow?

'I’m all for impeachment, but is an annulment even possible? I’d feel much better if his portrait was taken down and the next president was 45. '
"I don't advocate vengeance, but kids, if you must pay back, take your time and enjoy it."
'Remember a few months ago when the right-wing media was touting Trump’s loyalty, and claiming that is was his biggest weakness.'
'Oooooo, man, you just know that little twerp caved. He\'s got "spineless wimp" written all over him. No one listened to him when he was chief of staff and everyone treated him like shit. Well, you teach people how to treat you, and I wouldn\'t trust a doormat not to crack under pressure.'
'I hope that photo of him is from today, as he left his reaming.'
"What he's spent on his golfing outings isn't as troubling as the fact that so much of that money is going directly into Trump business accounts.\n\nThat alone should be illegal."
'Two months worth of golf trips cost the same (3 mil) as last 5 years of healthcare for all transgender troops in US army, cost he called "insurmountable".'
'Every opposing candidate should run on the following platform:\n\n“I don’t own golf clubs. I do not play golf. I will not waste tax dollars on playing golf.”'
"i like how comparing the two also conveniently leaves out the fact that HE'S ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COSTS OF THE MUELLER PROBE, BECAUSE IT ONLY EXISTS DUE TO HIS CRIMINALITY. so it's not just that he's spent all that money on the mar-a-lago trips, it's that he's ALSO caused that much money to be spent on the mueller probe. they're BOTH his fault. remember, the buck stops here. he wanted the responsibility, now he gets to fucking own it.

'Yesterday my only conservative friend was bitching about the cost of the Mueller probe. I reminded him about the costs of other investigations and told him to STFU about costs. It just makes him and his side of things look even more traitorous.'
"But he is doing so MUCH MORE than Obama that it's all worth it! /s"
"Looks like we've entered a new gilded age..."
"Even worse, this is taxpayer money that he spent at maralago goes back to himself, he's directly profiting from excessive spending of taxpayer money, and whether or not one thinks muellers spending is excessive, at least he isn't pocketing that money like Trump is."
"but it's okay because those money ends up in his pocket. "
'This is why I’m glad I don’t live in America '
'But he’s a king! Kings don’t have to care about spending other people’s money as long as it’s for them /s'
'He’s paying his businesses American tax payer money for himself to play golf and hob bob with other wealthy/political people? Why hasn’t he been hanged in the street yet?'
'Civil asset forfeiture could pay us back for both.  Just saying.'
"Great minds and all that...\n\nThat ws the first thing that came to mind: the expense of Trump's golfing expeditions. Security-issues alone are probably that much *per weekend*."
'In Soviet Russia, you get money for playing golf.'
'Thank you! I was waiting for this response to the probe cost. '
'I just wanna know if he’s actually any good at golf. I mean with this much practice maybe that’s his next career move?'
"I agree. It shouldn't cost that much for the president to go somewhere."
'You have a post about Trump every few hours for weeks. \n\n\nAre you okay dude?'
'How is this a headline LOL hasn’t he supposedly been doing this for the past year?'
"I'm reassured in this news. Good to know theres still new angles being developed to out these treason weasel bastards."
'Yeah they did and they did it through the NRA. Commie fuckwads.'
'Traitor Trump has a nice ring to it.'
'Season Spoiler Alert: They did.'
'I am amazed actually , this was proven by Dutch investigators a long time ago, there are many reports from news investigators and the connections to trump and oligarchs and russian Mafia. Well researched and something  that proves trump is a criminal and nothing more.'
"I wish it wasn't a video.  I want text on my phone."
"I'll save you some time Bob.\n\nThey did.\n\nCase closed."
"Huh. I'm curious about how to feel about this. If anyone can clarify: how does this information tie in to the report a couple days ago that Mueller is not criminally investigating TRump?"
"Why is this considered a new headline/report? Hasn't the news literally been talking nonstop about this for a year lol. Jesus christ, slow day I guess. "
'tl;dr: Yes they did.'
'Spoiler alert: they did. '
"It's almost as if old Vladdy Daddy is using certain useful idiots to cast domestic and international doubt on the validity of American democratic institutions."
'I’ve seen this exact headline on r/politics for months now... lol'
'The talk of deploying military to the border as well as other uproar from Trump suggested something was brewing.'
'Spoiler Alert: they did!'
"General question\n\nWhen Mueller (or any high level investigator) calls someone in for questioning, are they confirming hard evidence they already have, or are still trying to get new information from the testimony?\n\nI'm imagining that Mueller is just giving many of these witnesses the opportunity to commit perjury. "
'Citizens United, folks.'
'Is it just me or does it seem like the amount of leaks about this investigation is increasing rapidly in the last couple of weeks? '
'Yes, the answer is yes they did.\nProblem is proving it. '
"No, he's investigating how well they covered their tracks.  "
"Didn't Reagan do something like this also? "
'One more charge of Obstruction of Justice please!'
"Trump did something the democrats have been pushing for years ( https://www.thedailybeast.com/democrats-are-now-pushing-obama-to-give-guns-to-ukraine )  and now they're regretting it.  LOL"
"Remember when the Trump fanboys used to claim the investigation wasn't about Trump at all? lol  And then when they claimed it was really about Hillary?"
'Anywhere in the world that justice is happening, you can count on Orange Man to swoop in and obstruct it. '
'Come on now. Trump didn\'t do any of this.   Probably just a coffee boy that shipped them those missles and they happened to decide to stop helping Mueller.   I believe that person\'s name is "Peter Peniston" who totally doesn\'t use Propecia and has magnificent genes and flowing long locks of hair.  And no std\'s.  Or Russian prostitute urine on him.  \n\n-Peter Peniston probably'
'Pretty short-sighted. '
'> At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!\n\nIt appears you might already be doing that.'
'Wow '
"This really sucks, but I can't really blame Ukraine. If they're facing a choice between their survival as a country or helping the US conduct an investigation, I understand why they stopped cooperating."
'Can Mueller just go straight to the supreme court and get an arrest warrant? Serious question.'
'>The two-page filing doesn’t offer much in the way of details, but each subpeona orders the recipient to appear at the federal courthouse in Alexandria on July 10 at 10 a.m. to testify in trial of Manafort on charges stemming from Mueller’s investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nJuly 10th - Need to book a holiday, and stock up on popcorn and booze.

'At this point it might be easier to just create a list of people are not  going to get subpoenaed...'
"I haven't laughed out loud this much in a 24 hour span since late 2016. What a glorious 24 hours."
'I mean the only reasons he‘s doing this, is to\n\na) nail Manaforts ass to the backside of a cell\n\nb) during the deposition get incriminating statements towards Trump (which I‘m sure he‘s getting)\n\n\nAlso I think the Mueller Team clearly communicated the June 10th deadline towards Trumps legal team. Either coorporate (e.g. agree to the interview) or get hammered in front of a Court.'
'The last 24 hours have been like F5 bukkake.'
'is that a lot? that seems like alot?'
'As awesome as this is, the general public is long overdue for a new indictment. We need to remind the out of touch masses this is serious shit.\n\nWithout a constant stream of guilty pleas the public will keep getting more numb to news like this. '
'Would anybody else not be upset if he just sobpoenaed Trump 70 times?'
"July 10 sure does line up nicely with the request to hold on to Flynn for 2 more months. Can't help but wonder if the whole thing is connected."
"And over at the Donald they're acting as if this routine and justified legal investigative procedure is some massive scandal.\n\nThe Feds got a warrant and tapped a suspect. Next."
'These subpoenas would be for witnesses, right? 70 seems like a lot...'
'70 Subpoenas for one day in court? I think Mueller about to bring the whole mob together for one last reunion, this is going to be interesting'
'Rick Gates is definitely informing the FBI as they go along the case(s), each and every day.'
'To paraphrase Colonel Trautman in First Blood: "If you send that many men after him, don\'t forget one thing. A good supply of blank subpoenas."'
'Still look like a nothing burger trumplets? '

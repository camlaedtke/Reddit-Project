Don't let Donald Trump pick a Supreme Court justice unless and until Mueller clears him
'Huge shoutout to NYT for some awesome reporting during this entire Trump Presidency. They are playing a legitimate role in saving our democracy. '
'I have been a student of history. And honestly I don’t remember a Congress in recent history that wouldn’t have been up in arms against such a president. Instead we have a congress where republicans are going out of their way to not only defend this sham of a presidency but attacking the men and women of intelligence agencies that are the frontline defense for the security of this country. This is the polar opposite of making America great.  This is Putin’s check. Will it become checkmate is what should scare every decent American, patriot or otherwise. '
"It's worth noting... \n\nThere's likely a *very* good reason we haven't heard about this, until now. \n\nMost of the big leaks regarding Trump and this investigation have been carefully timed. I'm sure it's no coincidence that we're hearing this the day after Trump leaves the country"
'Every person commenting better have subscribed to a newspaper of some sort. A free (and financially supported!) press is one of the greatest weapons we have against tyranny. '
"To all who is guilding this post, please consider subscribing to the Times. We need to support this kind of journalism and they've earned it."
'>Ty Cobb, who manages the White House’s relationship with Mr. Mueller’s office, said in a statement, “We decline to comment out of respect for the Office of the Special Counsel and its process.”\n\nTranslation: please, please, please use lube'
'The free press is literally going to be responsible for saving our republic. God bless them. They don’t get enough praise or credit. '
"> After receiving the president’s order to fire Mr. Mueller, the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, refused to ask the Justice Department to dismiss the special counsel, saying he would quit instead, the people said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing a continuing investigation.\n\n\nI'm impressed by McGahn for the first time."
'Honestly this entire debacle has really helped shape my life. I was a listless young adult and I’m now chasing a law degree and wanting to get involved in politics. I apply to uva and William and Mary in the fall. Wish me luck...'
"Honestly I'm not surprised, I didn't think Mueller would get this far. Good on the lawyers"
"I hope young people are paying attention to this. This is something you'll be talking about well into your adulthood. Believe it or not, one day you'll know people much younger than yourselves who were not around to witness this, or are too young to remember. You'll be the person they ask about this when they're doing their homework, or learning about it generally.\n\nIt's one of the best things about getting older. Keep these details and developments in your mind."
">WASHINGTON — The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has subpoenaed the Trump Organization to turn over documents, including some related to Russia, according to two people briefed on the matter. The order is the first known time that the special counsel demanded documents directly related to President Trump’s businesses, bringing the investigation closer to the president.\n\n>The breadth of the subpoena was not clear, nor was it clear why Mr. Mueller issued it instead of simply asking for the documents from the company, an umbrella organization that oversees Mr. Trump’s business ventures. In the subpoena, delivered in recent weeks, Mr. Mueller ordered the Trump Organization to hand over all documents related to Russia and other topics he is investigating, the people said.\n\n>The subpoena is the latest indication that the investigation, which Mr. Trump’s lawyers once regularly assured him would be completed by now, will drag on for at least several more months. Word of the subpoena comes as Mr. Mueller appears to be broadening his investigation to examine the role foreign money may have played in funding Mr. Trump’s political activities. In recent weeks, Mr. Mueller’s investigators have questioned witnesses, including an adviser to the United Arab Emirates, about the flow of Emirati money into the United States.\n\nSo if they've had to resort to subpoenas, is it safe to assume the Special Counsel already requested the documents and were denied by the Trump Organization?\n\nEdit - from Ari Melber; Senior congressional source says that Mueller beginning with a subpoena, rather than typical document request, suggests special counsel intends to put every Trump Org staffer on alert not to destroy evidence."
'I love that the NYT is doing this right before Huckabee takes the podium.'
'I love that this comes out after the House Intelligence Committee Republicans closed their investigation\n\nFoot -> mouth. '
"If you think about it, Trump is a character worthy of his own shakespearean tragedy. Born with a silver spoon in his mouth, always trying to fill the void where his fathers love should have been. Someone who - if he had been humble enough to feel contend with what he had - would have had an easy life full of luxury most people could only dream of. But then he nearly loses everything he owns because of his ineptitude. Overcoming this by turning to the dark side even more, he craves fame. But fame isn't enough in the end, he needs to have respect, admiration and power as well. Which leads him to become the most powerful person in the world. Then, when he thinks he has it all, everything around him starts to crumble, every evil deed is being dragged into the light, every sin exposed. In the end, he has nothing again and tainted his family name forever.\n\nAssuming that it ends this way.\nI can almost picture the play. "
'Can we just take a moment to appreciate what Obama did to make this possible?  Allowing our intelligence services to communicate freely and share information most likely saved our democracy from tyranny.  He will go down as the most important President since Lincoln. '
'>Mr. Trump’s lawyers are in negotiations with Mr. Mueller’s office about whether and how to allow his investigators to interview the president. Mr. Mueller’s office has shared topics it wants to discuss with the president, according to two people familiar with the talks. **The lawyers have advised Mr. Trump to refuse an interview but the president wants to do it, as he believes he has done nothing wrong and can easily answer investigators’ questions.**\n\nNow this is just impressively stupid.'
"He subpoenaed documents he could just asked for.\n\nHe didn't bother asking and just subpoenaed them.\n\nWhich tells us, this is more assertive but also perhaps Trump associates have not been forth coming with what they have been asked to produce or be truthful about."
'It\'s kind of beautiful that the first subpoena directed at the Trump Organization is on the Ides of March. Google\'s definition is pretty funny: "it was marked by several religious observances and notable for the Romans as a deadline for settling debts."'
"Mueller doesn't give a crap about crossing any red line, because there isn't any. He has broad authority to investigate any matters arising. he is zero afraid of the investigation being terminated, and is acting as if he has zero fear of that. he is not stepping on egg shells. he is being strategic with his subpoenas and indictments, but he's not cow-towing.    \n\nit makes me think he's got something that can stop Trump from actually shutting it down or trying to shut it down. not sure what that would be unless he's also friends with Putin and they've been sharing as well. or he has such a good back up plan it won't matter (protected off-shore data vault, numerous state AG's having copies of evidence, etc etc.)"
'Happy Infrastructure Week!'
">The lawyers\xa0have advised Mr. Trump to refuse an interview but the president wants to do it, as he believes he has done nothing wrong and can easily answer investigators’ questions.\n\nOh please please please do it. Feed your ego by going in there thinking you're smarter than Mueller. I hope there's video released if it ever happens. "

'I think it’s important not to forget that 33% of the country will consider this to be a liberal conspiracy. Hope our country remains strong as this begins to wind up. '
'This is gold.  All week long, from almost any conservative media outlet without fail (and even members of Congress), it\'s been, "The tide is turning...", "The REAL collusion....", "Mueller must resign...".  Then today came.  \n\nHope they\'re enjoying their Friday evening.  '
'Fucking finally! Happy Friday everyone!'
"This, combined with Dana Boente resigning today, spell something big. What are the chances these two things are coincidental? \n\nThe only thing I can imagine Boente could testify directly to is a conversation he has had with Trump/Admin officials. I wonder if someone else was asked for loyalty and it helps corroborate a certain obstruction of justice charge?  \n\nedit: It's probably just Flynn or Manafort though. Maybe even a small fry like Cater Page. "
"LMAO CNN is hinting that its manafort soooooooo hard right now. They're saying his name and saying money laundering as much as possible for no real reason lol. this is great"
'Based on the fact that I work for Donald Trump as his assistant, therefore well informed, I think this is Fake News. The most beautiful and the most important news is the release of the JFK Files. '
'Just FYI:\n\n**8:29pm ET** CNN breaks news\n\n**8:56pm ET** MSNBC, citing CNN, breaks news\n\nAs of now, Fox News is discussing the new developments on the Steele dossier, calling it a "Democratic Party scandal".\n\n**UPDATE AT 9:33PM:** Now Fox News is doing a segment on...Hillary Clinton\'s emails. \n\n**UPDATE #2 AT 10:02PM:** CBSN (CBS News\' online-only 24-hour news channel), citing CNN\'s report, breaks the news. \nFox News has Jesse Watters reporting on the Free Beacon/Steele dossier updates, and saying the media is "downplaying" the new developments.'
'The largest/fastest growing headline of this on r/td is "BREAKING: Mueller has filed first charges in Russia investigation. If it isn\'t Podesta or Hillary, fire his ass.".  \n\nDo I even need to say it?  They want to sac Mueller if the factual evidence doesn\'t support their cause but keep him if it does.  The cognitive dissonance is breathtaking, or mental gymnastics as they would put it, since scientific terms like "cognitive dissonance" are frowned upon down at r/td.  Stay tuned, that subreddit is incapable of having a meltdown but it will be fun watching them twist logic and semantics so much, it forms a sailor\'s knot.'
'I get that this is exciting. But come on now, you honestly think this won\'t be another big old bout of " and then nothing happened" ? \n\nCalm your expectations. Trump or the GOP isn\'t putting down power because of some indictments, look at what they\'ve already done. This is just a line drawn in the sand and that line will be crossed. The real question is what will people do then. \n\nBut hey, here\'s hoping i\'m wrong. '
'Happy Halloween!'
'> The new revelation makes it clear that Mueller and his team are investigating the president’s financial transactions.\n  \nI like reading that sentence.'

'“Goodnight sweet prince”. I hope Mueller throws the book at Trump.'
"Step 1: Get all financial records, account for every penny in or out\n\nStep 2: Get tax returns, compare to financial records\n\nStep 3: Invite the sitting President of the United States into the office to answer a few questions\n\nShit's about to get super fucking hairy, ya'll."
'gosh, I hope his bank records get “leaked”. The one thing that would just embarrass the fuck out of trump would be people finding out he isn’t a real billionaire.   \nI like the progress here, I’m fascinated by the potential results. '
'We\'re moving past the "nothing happened" phase and, I predict, into the "but everyone else does it" phase. "But the Clintons launder money! Why aren\'t you investigating them?". "All politicians accept bribes! Investigate all the Democrats who accept bribes!".\n\nAlso ~~queue~~ cue Trump\'s base parroting this and saying things like "he didn\'t break the rules, he just bent them a little".'

"This has 35,000 upvotes and almost 4,000 comments.\n\nThe top story on r/conservative is fucking Joy Behar from The View apparently said she doesn't want Trumps tax plan to pass. Fucking breaking news for the right."
'As a Brit, this recent barrage of stories made me really want to learn more about watergate, and how it might relate to what we are seeing now, so I just watched ‘All the President’s Men’.\n\nAside from it being an absolutely fantastic film that had my heart thumping throughout (Spotlight clearly drew quite a lot of inspiration from it) it is also a really relevant watch for right now, because it reminds you just how much the GOP are capable of, and it really shows how important it is that we protect the free press, even if they make mistakes, or print stuff that pisses us off. \n\nAny who call stories and investigations like these sensationalist nonsense need to remember that watergate really wasn’t that long ago in the grand scheme of things. This investigation by Muller is absolutely vital, and any slight indication of Trump trying to sabotage it should be met with total and complete resistance, even if you are a republican. Party politics is nothing compared to protecting your democratic institutions. \n\nThe truth must come out. '

"Financial Times (paywall so can't post on /r/politics) has the most detailed account that I've seen so far: \n\n[**Deutsche Bank sends Trump financial details to Mueller investigation**](https://www.ft.com/content/3c357c9a-d9dc-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482)\n\n-\n\n> Deutsche Bank **has begun sending information** about its dealings with Donald Trump to US investigators probing alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential race **following a subpoena by Robert Mueller**, the special counsel heading the federal inquiry.\n\n> A person with **direct knowledge of the German bank’s actions told the Financial Times the production of Trump-related documents had begun several weeks ago**. “Deutsche could not hand over client information without a subpoena,” said a **second person with direct knowledge of the subpoena**. “It’s helpful to be ordered to do so.”\n\n-\n\n> A Frankfurt-based spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment but said the bank “takes its legal obligations seriously and remains committed to co-operating with authorised investigations into this matter”. \n\n-\n\n> Democratic lawmakers have repeatedly asked Deutsche for details of its dealings with Mr Trump, but because Republicans control both houses of Congress, such requests do not have the power of a subpoena. The bank said it could not co-operate unless it was served with a subpoena or the documents were formally requested by a congressional committee.\n\n-\n\n> **Privately, senior executives at Deutsche were eagerly awaiting a subpoena** as they maintained the bank had nothing to hide, arguing there was no smoking gun in Mr Trump’s accounts. \n\n-\n\nFrom FT's reporting, they have at least two sources confirming a subpoena, and probably more considering the insight into the Senior Execs @ DB. The statement from Deutsche Bank also doesn't deny the reporting of a subpoena..."

'Excerpts from the [indictments](https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download):\n\n* Defendants\' operations included supporting the presidential campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump ("Trump Campaign") and disparaging Hillary Clinton. Defendants made various expenditures to carry out those activities, including buying political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities. Defendants also staged political rallies inside the United States, and while posing as U.S. grassroots entities and U.S. persons, and without revealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation, solicited and compensated real U.S. persons to promote or disparage candidates. Some Defendants, posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump Campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities.\n\n* In order to carry out their activities to interfere in U.S. political and electoral processes without detection of their Russian affiliation, Defendants conspired to obstruct the lawful functions of the United States government through fraud and deceit, including by making expenditures in connection with the 2016 U.S. presidential election without proper regulatory disclosure; failing to register as foreign agents carrying out political activities within the United States; and obtaining visas through false and fraudulent statements.\n\n* Defendants and their co-conspirators used their fictitious online personas to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election. They engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.\n\n* On or about February 10, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators internally circulated an outline of themes for future content to be posted to ORGANIZATION-controlled social media accounts. Specialists were instructed to post content that focused on "politics in the USA" and to "use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump--we support them)."\n\n* From at least April 2016 through November 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, while concealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation through false personas, began to produce, purchase, and post advertisements on U.S. social media and other online sites expressly advocating for the election of then-candidate Trump or expressly opposing Clinton. Defendants and their co-conspirators did not report their expenditures to the Federal Election Commission, or register as foreign agents with the U.S. Department of Justice. The political advertisements included the following:\n\n>* April 6, 2016 "You know, a great number of black people support us saying that #HillaryClintonlsNotMyPresident"\n* April 7, 2016 "I say no to Hillary Clinton / I say no to manipulation"\n* April 19, 2016 "JOIN our #HillaryClintonForPrison2016"\n* May 10, 2016 "Donald wants to defeat terrorism ... Hillary wants to sponsor it"\n* May 19, 2016 "Vote Republican, vote Trump, and support the Second Amendment!"\n* May 24, 2016 "Hillary Clinton Doesn\'t Deserve the Black Vote"\n* June 7, 2016 "Trump is our only hope for a better future!"\n* June 30, 2016 "#Never Hillary #Hillary F orPrison #Hillary4 Prison #HillaryForPrison2016 #Trump2016 #Trump #Trump4President"\n* July 20, 2016 "Ohio Wants Hillary 4 Prison"\n* August 4, 2016 "Hillary Clinton has already committed voter fraud during the Democrat Iowa Caucus."\n* August 10, 2016 "We cannot trust Hillary to take care of our veterans!"\n* October 14, 2016 "Among all the candidates Donald Trump is the one and only who can defend the police from terrorists."\n* October 19, 2016 "Hillary is a Satan, and her crimes and lies had proved just how evil she is."\n\n* To pay for the political advertisements, Defendants and their co-conspirators established various Russian bank accounts and credit cards, often registered in the names of fictitious U.S. personas created and used by the ORGANIZATION on social media. Defendants and their coconspirators also paid for other political advertisements using PayPal accounts.\n\n* Beginning in at least 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used, without lawful\nauthority, the social security numbers, home addresses, and birth dates ofreal U.S. persons without\ntheir knowledge or consent. Using these means of stolen identification, Defendants and their coconspirators\nopened accounts at a federally insured U.S. financial institution ("Bank I")\n\n* Defendants and their co-conspirators purchased credit card and bank account numbers from online sellers for the unlawful purpose of evading security measures at PayPal, which used account numbers to verify a user\'s identity. Many of the bank account numbers purchased by Defendants and their co-conspirators were created using the stolen identities of real U.S. persons. After purchasing the accounts, Defendants and their co-conspirators submitted these bank account numbers to PayPal.\n\n* On or about August 18, 2016, the real "Florida for Trump" Facebook account responded to\nthe false U.S. persona "Matt Skiber" account with instructions to contact a member of the Trump\nCampaign ("Campaign Official l ") involved in the campaign\'s Florida operations and provided Campaign Official 1\'s email address at the campaign domain donaldtrump.com.On approximately the same day, Defendants and their co-conspirators used the email address of a false U.S. persona, joshmilton024@gmail.com, to send an email to Campaign Official 1 at that donaldtrump.com email account, which read in part:\n\n>* "Hello [Campaign Official l], [w]e are organizing a state-wide event in Florida on August, 20 to support Mr. Trump. Let us introduce ourselves first. "Being Patriotic" is a grassroots conservative online movement trying to unite people offline. . . . [W]e gained a huge lot of followers and decided to somehow help Mr. Trump get elected. You know, simple yelling on the Internet is not enough. There should be real action. We organized rallies in New York before. Now we\'re focusing on purple states such as Florida." The email also identified thirteen "confirmed locations" in Florida for the rallies and requested the campaign provide "assistance in each location."\n\n* On or about August 24, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators updated an internal\nORGANIZATION list of over 100 real U.S. persons contacted through ORGANIZATIONcontrolled\nfalse U.S. persona accounts and tracked to monitor recruitment efforts and requests.\nThe list included contact information for the U.S. persons, a summary of their political views, and\nactivities they had been asked to perform by Defendants and their co-conspirators.'
"President's Day weekend would be a deliciously symbolic moment to unleash a wide array of indictments.   Please let these, against the Russians, only be the beginning."
"The most important thing about this is that it confirms, in stunning detail, the narrative that most Americans have accepted as true.  This transcends and counters talking points, the Administration's defense, and the President's denial.\n\nThese INDICTMENTS demonstrate that Russians employed a large-scale, sophisticated attack on our democracy.  Wars have been fought over much, much smaller events."
"For those interested, Mueller's indictment recaps a series of exposés we published last Fall revealing that the Kremlin’s trolls had impersonated American advocacy groups and organized real-world rallies in support of Donald Trump on American soil.

'"ORGANIZATION" here refers to the Internet Research Agency, the notorious Russian internet troll farm.\n\n>Defendant ORGANIZATION had a strategic goal to sow discord in the U.S. political system, including the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Defendants posted derogatory information about a number of candidates, and **by early to mid-2016, Defendants\' operations included supporting the presidential campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump ("Trump Campaign") and disparaging Hillary Clinton.** Defendants made various expenditures to carry out those activities, including buying political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities. Defendants also staged political rallies inside the United States, and while posing as U.S. grassroots entities and U.S. persons, and without revealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation, solicited and compensated real U.S. persons to promote or disparage candidates. **Some Defendants, posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump Campaign** and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities.\n\nAmazing details on the size of their operations!\n\n>The ORGANIZATION **employed hundreds of individuals** for its online operations, ranging from creators of fictitious personas to technical and administrative support. **The ORGANIZATION\'s annual budget totaled the equivalent of millions of U.S. dollars.**\n\n>The ORGANIZATION was headed by a management group and organized into departments, including: a graphics department; a data analysis department; a\nsearch-engine optimization ("SEO") department; an information-technology ("IT") department to maintain the digital infrastructure used in the ORGANIZATION\'s\noperations; and a finance department to budget and allocate funding.\n\n>**The ORGANIZATION sought, in part, to conduct what it called "information warfare against the United States of America"** through fictitious U.S. personas on social media platforms and other Internet-based media.\n\nThey actually paid a U.S. citizen to stand in front of the White House and hold up a birthday message for their boss, Prigozhin.\n\n>For example, on or about May 29, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, through an ORGANIZATION-controlled social media account, **arranged for a real U.S. person to stand in front of the White House in the District of Columbia under false pretenses to hold a sign that read "Happy 55th Birthday Dear Boss."** Defendants and their co-conspirators informed the real U.S. person that the sign was for someone who "is a leader here and our boss ... our funder." PRIGOZHIN\'s Russian passport identifies his date of birth as June 1, 1961.\n\nAs we already knew, they were very active in trolling Bernie supporters.\n\n>By 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used their fictitious online personas to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election. **They engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.**\n\n-\n\n>Specialists were instructed to post content that focused on "politics in the USA" and to **"use any opportunity to\ncriticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump-we support them)."**\n\nLots of info about them starting fake political rallies.  One tidbit:\n\n>Defendants and their co-conspirators asked one U.S. person to build a cage on a flatbed truck and another U.S. person to wear a costume portraying Clinton in a prison uniform. Defendants and their co-conspirators paid these\nindividuals to complete the requests.\n\nYou\'d think that they\'d know better than to write about it...\n\n>Defendants and their co-conspirators thereafter destroyed evidence for the purpose of impeding the investigation. On or about September 13, 2017, KAVERZINA wrote in an email to a family member: **"We had a slight crisis here at work: the FBI busted our activity (not a joke).** So, I got preoccupied with covering tracks together with the colleagues." KAVERZINA further wrote, **"I created all these pictures and posts, and the Americans believed that it was written by their people."**'
'**SethAbramson:**\n\nMr. Trump, you told the Russians you\'d be running for president in Moscow in November 2013—and indeed it was that declaration that led to the anti-U.S. campaign in early 2014. Cohen had made clear by mid-2013 you were running; you confirmed it to the Agalarovs and Yulya Alferova.\n \nDonald J. Trump\n✔\n@realDonaldTrump\nRussia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President. The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!\n\n2:18 PM - Feb 16, 2018\n45.9K\n48.2K people are talking about this\n\n\n>**2/** In Spring 2013, The New York Post interviewed Michael Cohen about the bevy of presidential polls you had put in the field. Cohen said, in answer to questions about whether this meant you were running for president, "Well, we\'re not taking these polls to stow them in a drawer."\n\n>**3/**  Immediately thereafter—mere weeks—Russia suddenly put in a bid for the 2013 Miss Universe pageant by wooing you face-to-face at the Miss USA pageant in Las Vegas in June. The Russian delegation needed mere hours to convince you Russia should leapfrog 19 nations for the honor.\n\n>**4/**  The Agalarovs, Ike Kaveladze (later at Trump Tower in June 2016), Yulya Alferova, and Artem Klyushin made up the Russian delegation, which overpaid you for the Miss Universe pageant by giving you $20 million, which helped keep the pageant from bankruptcy, according to reports.\n\n>**5/**  Your own tweets reveal you were also promised a meeting with Putin, which you\'d been seeking for years. Yet by the time you arrived in Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant in November, Putin had backed out—because your presidential ambitions were by then clear to the Russians.\n\n>**6/**  Cohen—childhood friend of ex-Russian mobster Felix Sater—of course had every opportunity to communicate to the Russians what he\'d already implied to The New York Post about you running. Even if he hadn\'t, you communicated it directly to your new business partners in Moscow.\n\n>**7/**  Yulya Alferova tweeted to you shortly after you left Moscow that she knew you\'d make a great president. It was a topic you\'d discussed with the Russians in November 2013 in Moscow as they were developing for you—with Putin\'s blessing—a wildly lucrative Trump Tower Moscow deal.\n\n>**8/**  We know this because Putin sent to your pageant—in his place—his permits man, Vlad Kozhin. He also sent his banker—head of SVB—to host you. \n\n>And of course Aras Agalarov was and is the Kremlin\'s real estate developer. So Putin backed out but gave you those three men in return.\n\n>**9/**  The result, according to Emin Agalarov in a Forbes interview, was you signed a letter-of-intent in Moscow in November 2013 for Trump Tower Moscow—using funding from Putin\'s banker (announced 10 days later), land from Putin\'s developer, and permit approval from his permits man.\n\n>**10/**  As Putin was—from a distance—arranging this lucrative deal for you, you were confirming the signals Cohen had already sent far and wide: you would run for president. Yulya Alferova, a member of your Moscow entourage, left your company in Moscow with no doubt about your plans.\n\n>**11/**  Within a matter of *weeks* the Russian operation had started up. \n\n>You, Don and Ivanka remained in regular telephonic and in-person contact with your new business partners—the Agalarovs, Putin\'s developers—during early 2014, as the Russian machine began its attack on America.\n\n>**12/**  All this is *confirmable* by your tweets; the social media accounts of your Russian entourage; public statements by your own entourage; interviews given by you and others to major media; and statements you made privately to your friends at the time. There are pictures galore.\n\n>**13/**  Indeed, Aras Agalarov publicly announced in February of *2017* (not a typo)—via a major Russian construction website—that the letter-of-intent you signed with him in November 2013 became inactive only *after* you ascended to the presidency, as you now "couldn\'t do any deals."\n\n>**14/**  Mind you, this is separate from Schiller confirming that a Russian in your Moscow entourage offered you prostitutes. And hey, guess what? Artem Klyushin—a Russian in your entourage—had a best friend named Konstantin Rykov. What does Rykov do? He runs Moscow\'s largest brothel.\n\n>**15/**  Fortunately, there\'s no evidence Rykov and Klyushin worked together to help elect you. \n\n>Actually, let\'s scratch that—as before the Buzzfeed dossier ever came into the public sphere, Rykov bragged publicly, on social media, that he and Klyushin worked together to elect you.\n\n>**16/**  Rykov\'s specific boast—which included facts that would later end up in the dossier, but which he couldn\'t have known at the time unless he had access to classified U.S. intelligence—was that the plan to aid you in becoming president began, in Russia, sometime in 2011 or 2012.\n\n>**17/** All this is just the "Cliffs Notes" version of a mountain of documentary evidence suggesting the Russians knew you were running for president well before Americans formally did—and that they began their operations in 2014 fully aware that by mid-2015 you would announce a run.\n\n>**18/**  It\'s fortunate you only watch Fox News—as from watching that media outlet you would\'ve had no idea that these events have been traced by both major media *and* independent journalists. And it\'s from within that ignorance that you claim Russia\'s 2014 actions are exculpatory.\n\n>**19/**  Neither Bob Mueller nor major-media journalists like Luke Harding are tracing your involvement with the Russians as beginning in 2015—when you announced your presidential run. They are seeing evidence that in 2013—and even before—you had let Russia know your political plans.\n\n>**20/** It will be found—as it\'s the only theory of the case consistent with the facts—that it was your statement to Russian nationals that you\'d run for president in 2016 that was the proximate cause of their decision to wage a massive cyber-campaign explicitly directed to aid you.\n\n>**CONCLUSION/** *No one* in the intel community confirms your claim—or Pence\'s—that the election results weren\'t affected by Russia. And we already *know* from macroanalysis that your hijinks with Giuliani to coerce Comey into re-opening Clinton\'s case *did* affect the results. {end}'
"Haha, this is brilliant by Mueller!\n\nAfter busting lower level Americans to show their are domestic ties to all this...\n\nHe then drops indictments on the foreign ties while leaving donald dangling.\n\ndonald can't do shit!  This proves more and more that the investigation 100% has merit!\n\nnot a single American that cares about our country should be upset about these indictments.\n\nNo more talk of shutting down Mueller."
'I expect the new narrative from the cult to be that the phrase "unwitting individuals" is proof that the Trump campaign didn\'t knowingly collude with the Russians. Far from it; any presidential campaign is enormous. The fact that some members of the campaign unwittingly interacted with Russians trolls  is guaranteed, and I can guarantee the same is also true of the Clinton and Sanders campaigns.\n\nBear this in mind: if a decision was made at the highest levels to cooperate with the Russian disinformation campaign in exchange for "debt management" or "adoptions," that fact would not have been communicated to workers on the front lines. Not even Don Jr., arguably the dimmest of the clan, would send out an email blast alerting the campaign of their decision to engage in a monstrous criminal conspiracy.\n\nI think Mueller is playing this perfectly: he\'s establishing the underlying, foundational offense first. He will prove in the public eye, beyond any contest, that the Russians engaged in a systematic and coordinated effort to tip the election to Trump. Once that is done, and the "no Russian interference" defense is nothing but a fading whisper, he will prove the quid-pro-quo for that interference.\n\nBy starting with the Russians, the President\'s defenders are given little room; they can\'t readily get on national television and take up on behalf of the foreign trolls. What will pass their lips is one more "well yes, but..." that further shrinks the distance between the President and this shitstorm.'
'Smart move.  Now if Trump interferes it will look like he did it to protect the Russians. This makes it harder to say the investigation is just a witch hunt targeted exclusively at the Trump campaign. Unless, of course, the Russians were part of the Trump campaign!'
"Even if this were legal for them to do this, even if it passes, even if Mueller recurses himself and does not investigate any longer, there are a lot of other, very reputable, very capable people in his team which would continue to investigate.\nAnd I'm certainly convinced that someone like Mueller would be prepared for this contingency. Especially now that these Repub lawmakers just tipped their hand to him."

If that\'s true, this person needs to be identified and impeached immediately. But considering the indictment only refers to the person as a "candidate" rather than a current elected official, there\'s a chance the person did not get elected. \n\nI want to think Mueller is holding back on the identification because either 1) the person didn\'t get elected or 2) there\'s still an ongoing criminal investigation into the person, or frankly both. But if the person did get elected I think it\'s in the best interest of the country to identify the person and get him or her out of congress immediately. '
"Folks, this is a big deal. Not only does this conclusively prove that Russian Intelligence actively supported the Trump campaign and attacked the Clinton Campaign, the indictment also says that:\n\nA) Someone in Trump's inner circle had contacts with Russian intelligence and (p.16) and B) a GOP candidate personally solicited stolen documents from Russian intelligence. (Also on p.15-16)\n\nThis is high treason against the United States. Pure and simple."

'After reading through the indictment, there are multiple references to "logged in to XYZ server" or "on the same computer" or "on the same server".

The Conspirators operated the @dcleaks_ Twitter account from the same computer used for other efforts to interfere with the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.

The AIVD hackers had not infiltrated just any building; they were in the computer network of the infamous Russian hacker group Cozy Bear.

Many of these officials are known to currently work in the White House/Trump Administration. The thing is though, they clearly don\'t know what other emails Mueller may have... but if Mueller got their communications from the ptt.gov host, then it would be a safe bet that Mueller can get ALL of those emails (if he hasn\'t already done so already).\n\n-\n\nSo... guess who else was part of the [Trump transition team?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_transition_of_Donald_Trump) Numerous GOP Congresspeople, including some on powerful House Committees:\n\n-\n\n* Rep.

"> Special counsel Bob Mueller has teamed up with the IRS. According to sources familiar with his investigation into alleged Russian election interference, his probe has enlisted the help of agents from the IRS’ Criminal Investigations unit.\n\n> This unit—known as CI—is one of the federal government’s most tight-knit, specialized, and secretive investigative entities. Its 2,500 agents **focus exclusively on financial crime, including tax evasion and money laundering.** A former colleague of Mueller’s said he always liked working with IRS’ special agents, especially when he was a U.S. Attorney.\n\n> **And it goes without saying that the IRS has access to Trump’s tax returns—documents that the president has long resisted releasing to the public.**\n\nThe tweetstorm this weekend is going to be amazing.\n\nWill also add that if Trump et al committed federal tax crimes they very likely committed state tax crimes as well. While shell corporations to launder money could be based somewhere other than New York, there must be some connection to New York because of the real estate dimension of Trump's business."
"So this is a Special Prosecutor's team consisting of the most talented legal minds in the country, who have worked on RICO, money laundering and tax fraud cases. They have a Russian language expert, too. They're utilizing two grand juries, one in Virginia and one in D.C. They're working with the New York Attorney General, and have the files of the former US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, where Trump Tower is located. They're also working with the FBI and now, as many have suspected, we know they're working with the IRS. \n\nMueller has one chance to take this guy down, and he knows it. He is building the mother of all cases to do it. It's going to be spectacular."
'>“From the agents, I know everyone has the utmost respect for both Mueller and Weissmann,” said Martin Sheil, a retired IRS Criminal Investigations agent.\nAnd he said Mueller and Weissmann are known admirers of those agents’ work.\n“They view them with the highest regard,” Sheil said. “IRS special agents are the very best in the business of conducting financial investigations. They will quickly tell you that it took an accountant to nab Al Capone, and it’s true.”\n\nAnd Mueller, like Eliot Ness... is untouchable. Get em boys. '

'I agree with this sentiment, but here\'s the thing, Mueller hasn\'t formally even said Trump is under investigation personally (he almost 100% is). So while I agree, unless the Special Counsel comes out and says, "Yes, this president is under direct investigation" that action has no legs to it.\n\nRemember, most of what we see with Mueller investigation has just been pure guesswork. They literally have kept the whole things under wraps. We get to see bits and pieces, as entities become known, but we literally have no idea about the scope, and how far reaching it goes. We can assume Trump is under direction scrutiny, and the Orange Baboon seems to think so, but nothing has been officially declared.'

And when they said finished, they didn't actually mean finished, they meant until the investigation (s) found what they wanted them to find. That's the danger of this sort of thinking. Investigations take as long as they need to. If you get politics involved, that either means there's incentive to drag things along (for instance, to block a supreme court nominee), or there's incentive to hurry (which could mean vital information gets passed over).\n\n\nI understand why you're asking for what you're asking for, but the larger ramifications need to be considered."

I\'d imagine appeals for integrity must fall on pretty deaf ears when *everyone* has been playing dirty for decades.'
"If we used this same logic, Trump shouldn't really allowed to be president, or make any decisions until he's proven innocent.  Why would we stop at a supreme court pick, and then allow him to make decisions about war, policy, or law?\n\nEither way, it doesn't make a lot of sense in the United States, because he's presumed innocent, until proven guilty.   If Mueller proves that he's committed a crime in regards to the presidency, then I absolutely agree he shouldn't be allowed to do any of the above.  Until then, he's to be presumed to be innocent and should be allowed to operate as such.   "
"No this is a terrible solution! The new Supreme Court pick either shouldn't happen before the midterms or should recuse from any case regarding the independent council.\n\nYou do not want anyone to be able to officially decide whether a Supreme Court pick is correct other than chosen representatives.

He's used to having a safety net - his wealth.  That can no longer help him.  It'll only hit him towards the end.  He'll die in prison."
"Well Donnie.   If you haven't done anything wrong, Mueller is bluffing.   There's no better way to take down a bluffer than calling his bluff.   "

Thanks guys, I consider it an honor that my comment bothered you so much. '
'Trump also said he would release his tax returns.\n\nAnd that Mexico would pay for the wall.\n\nAnd that nobody in his campaign met with Russians.\n\nAnd that he would make great deals.\n\nAnd, presumably, that he would love, honor, and cherish his wife.\n\nAnd his other wife.\n\nAnd his other other wife.'

"Legit question to people who want to see trump in jail/impeached; are we going to accept the verdict if it  exonerates Trump? \n\nOn the technical side, what exactly happens if Trump is removed? I guess it depends on who else is removed with him, but I'm interested nonetheless.  "
'>Trump Says He Would Talk to Special Counsel Mueller Under Oath\r\n\nThis is why news about this administration is totally worthless. From this we can be sure that either:\n\n1. Trump is willing to talk to Mueller under oath.\n2. Trump is unwilling to talk to Mueller under oath, but wanted to lie about it for reasons we may never know.\n3. Trump wasn\'t really paying attention to what he was being asked and responded with what he reckoned the person asking him wanted to hear.\n4. Trump understood what was being asked, and said what he feels like a cool big-shot type of guy would say, but does not consider this an answer to the question of whether he will talk to Mueller. Instead he considers it an answer to the question: "are you a cool, Big-shot type of guy?" And that his answer was "yes."\n5. Something else.'
"Well we all know that he released his tax returns, made Mexico pay for the wall, declared China a currency manipulator, created targeted child tax credits, lowered the number of tax brackets, and sued all those women who accused him of sexual misconduct. So, I'm sure this is going to happen."
'> **It would also be one of the most significant developments thus far in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation** of whether the Trump campaign and the Kremlin worked together to help Trump win the White House. Undercutting Trump’s repeated pronouncements that **“there is no evidence of collusion,”** it also could ratchet up the stakes if the president tries, as he has intimated he might for months, to order Mueller’s firing.\n\nThat is a mother-fuckin BOOM.'
'> The Justice Department special counsel has evidence that Donald Trump’s personal lawyer and confidant, **Michael Cohen, secretly made a late-summer trip to Prague during the 2016 presidential campaign,** according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\n\n> Confirmation of the trip would lend credence to a retired British spy’s report that Cohen strategized there with a powerful Kremlin figure about Russian meddling in the U.S. election.\n\n\nB.

"I can't take today. WTF. It's buckets of crazy. Cohen sued Buzzfeed over this. How did he expect to prove he wasn't in Prague? \n\nAnd now Josh Marshall at Talking Points Memo says he is getting scoops from many different Trump operatives selling each other out now. Can you imagine the scoops that NYT and WP are getting?"
'I\'m always impressed with how right wing media can shift talking points and arguments on a whim. I\'m going to be absolutely fascinated what they say after proof of collusion begins to come together in such an airtight way, it can\'t be denied. Because right now, right wing radio pundits and TV personalities have been treating the Cohen raid like Mueller has nothing and is spinning his tires. Where\'s the collusion? they ask.\n\nAnyone who spends even a minute amount of time researching Mueller\'s career, know that this guy isn\'t someone to be trifled with. His team is incredible. Trump\'s lawyers are floundering. But where\'s the collusion? When that narrative is laid to rest...what do they say next?\n\nIt will be the largest about face in modern American history. The biggest egg-on-face in my lifetime. They will shift and contort better than a Russian prostitute I\'m sure. It\'s this ballet I\'m fascinated with. This art of propaganda. And folks...it is an art. Watching how these guys react to contradicting information is must see TV. I applaud their mastery of screwing over our country. \n\nGeorge Carlin once said - "When you\'re born you get a ticket to the freak show. When you\'re born in America, you get a front row seat."\n\nI\'ve got my popcorn ready. Lets begin.'
'If this meeting in Prague is confirmed then I am willing to put money on the fact that one of the most explosive parts of the dossier will also be shown to be true - that Trump was offered a stake in the Rosneft sale in exchange for removing sanctions and for going easy on them for the eastern Ukraine intervention. The dossier reports that Carter Page met with Igor Sechin of Rosneft when the deal was offered:\n\n> Speaking to a trusted compatriot in mid October 2015, a close associate of Rosneft President and PUTIN ally Igor SECHIN elaborated on the reported secret meeting between the latter and Carter PAGE, of US Republican presidential candidate\'s foreign policy team, in Moscow in July 2016. The secret had been confirmed to him/her by a senior member of  staff, in addition to by the Rosneft President himself.\n\n> In terms of the substance of their discussion, SECHIN\'s associate said that the Rosneft President was so keen to lift personal and corporate western sanctions imposed on the company, that he offered PAGE associates the brokerage of up to a 19 per cent (privatised) stake in Rosneft in return PAGE had expressed interest and **confirmed that were TRUMP elected US President, then sanctions on Russia would be lifted.**\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee released a transcript of Page’s congressional testimony which revealed he had in fact met with Rosneft officials in Moscow, including Sechin\'s subordinate Andrey Baranov. \n\nThe Dossier also says the following:\n\n> Kremlin insider highlights importance lawyer, Michael COHEN in covert relationship with Russia. COHEN\'s wife is of Russian descent and her father is a leading property developer in Moscow.\n\n\n> According to the Kremlin insider, COHEN now was **heavily engaged in a cover up and damage limitation operation in the attempt to prevent the full details of relationship with Russia being exposed.** In pursuit of this aim, COHEN had met secretly with several Russian Presidential Administration (PA) Legal Department officials in an EU country in August 2016. The immediate issues had been to contain further scandals involving MANAFORT\'s commercial and political role in Russia/Ukraine and to limit the damage arising from exposure of former TRUMP foreign policy advisor, Carter PAGE\'s secret meetings with Russian leadership figures in Moscow the previous month. The overall objective had been to "to sweep it all under the carpet and make sure no connections could be fully established or proven".\n \nPretty sure this is all true. '
'I hope the dossier gets turned into a children’s storybook one day so children can understand what we’ve been dealing with. Need a good illustrator. '
'Pretty sure some people are booking flights out of the U.S. at this point. Walls are closing in - fast. '
'Brace yourselves. The Russians are coming. \n\nEdit: And to the Trump supporters flooding my inbox, please review the trending hashtags found on [this page](https://dashboard.securingdemocracy.org/) and try to understand that these trolls are playing both sides.\n\n'
'I think two at least will be foreign VIP members of the influence project.  Former European heads of state.\n\nAnd maybe the guy who said he hung up on Manafort because he thought he was trying to suborn perjury.'

"One thing I keep wondering about Manafort going to trial is the makeup of the jury.  All it takes for Manafort to walk away free as a bird is for one MAGA Deep State Trump supporter to find his way onto the jury.  Evidence isn't going to matter if there's one true believer on that jury.  "
'"Shit I mispoke. **KNOW** Collusion. Just read the transcript this morning. This whole time you guys thought I was saying *NO* collusion. I have the best words, it\'s not my fault America has been so foolish"'
'If Mueller believes immunity is appropriate here, I trust his judgment on it. Really curious who these folks are. The Manafort trial (assuming it still goes to trial) is going to be fascinating.'
'Wouldn’t this be another way of Muller signaling to Manafort that he should flip? Maybe Manafort was holding out hope that these witnesses would invoke the 5th at trial and Mueller is showing him that won’t happen now, thus giving Manafort more reason to cooperate. '
'The fun question is whether Manafort had disclosed this (these people and what they might have to say) to his lawyer, or whether this is a total surprise to the lawyer.\n\nLawyers don\'t like to be surprised with "Oh, yeah, I totally forgot to tell you about [list of associated crimes] with [list of accomplices]" or "Oh, [list of people] probably know about the [illegal shit I was doing]".\n\n\n'
'Wow these events will inspire a great movie in the future'
"I'll be honest this live reality tv show was so fun to watch as an outsider, so many twists, sad for America obviously"
"IANAL, but here are a couple of things I've noticed after reading the court document. 1) this is a memorandum in support of sealing identities of the five *potential* witnesses in the Manafort case. Their identities will only be revealed if they testify, not otherwise. 2) The identities of these witnesses are being protected because they are uncharged 3rd parties. Their identities are being protected to shield them from undue harassment related to the case. 3) The actual motions to seal the witnesses identities were submitted earlier, but as the memorandum is only coming out today we can surmise that it hasn't been ruled on yet. 4) it seems fairly common to protect potential witnesses in this manner with a lot of case law (submitted by Mueller's team) backing it up."

'Lawyer here:\nFor those who don\'t know, a grand jury is used to determine if there is "probable cause" to file charges, ie, indict one or more persons. "Probable cause" is a much lower bar than demonstrating guilt "beyond a reasonable doubt". It\'s basically a secret proceeding with jurors to determine if there is enough evidence to initiate a criminal trial.\n\nIt could be nothing, but also Mueller is experienced enough that he wouldn\'t start a grand jury proceeding unless he thought he could win it (get an indictment).'

'Here are some answers to basic questions that some folks might have.  Grand juries aren\'t used in most parts of the world, and even in the states many people aren\'t familiar with their function. \n\n**What is a grand jury?**  \nA grand jury is a body of citizens who are legally empowered to  investigate potential criminal conduct.  At the federal level (and in many states) prosecutors use grand juries to determine whether an  individual should be indicted for crimes.  In other words, a grand jury is impaneled to determine whether the state can formally accuse someone of a crime/many crimes.  Grand jurors can also compel witnesses to appear before them and can compel the production of documents. \n\nProsecutors sometimes use grand juries to issue subpoenas on people or entities to produce testimony or documents.  This essentially compels the subpoenaed party to produce certain evidence, or be held in contempt. \n\nUsing a grand jury to obtain documents or testimony has some advantage over law enforcement, since law enforcement needs a warrant to carry out a search and seizure.  Under certain circumstances witnesses who are compelled to testify may be able to invoke their Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. However, they will not be able to discuss this with their defense counsel during the proceeding. \n\nGrand jurors do not decide whether someone is guilty or not guilty.  That will be decided at a later time, in front of a different jury at trial.  Grand jurors also do not interact with a judge, other than being sworn in. \n\n**How many people serve on a grand jury?**   \nThe number can differ from district and states.  Typically, 16-23 people are selected to serve as jurors.  Of those, usually 16 or so are needed to form a quorum, which is the minimum number to decide whether to vote on an indictment.  Generally, a least 12 jurors need to vote to bring an indictment.  That said, this can vary from place to place. \n\n**How are grand juries typically selected?**   \n Potential jurors are selected through a summons in the mail, which compels them to appear before the court.  Potential jurors usually have the option of serving of deferring.  Some may be excused from serving for hardship, such as lost wages that could cause homelessness or a medical condition.  \n\n**How long is grand jury service?**  \nTypically, service on a grand jury lasts 5 weeks.  However, in some instances, a grand jury may be compelled to serve for months at a time. \n \n**What are a juror\'s obligations?**  \nThe grand jury process is very secret.  One reason it is secret is to protect witnesses from retribution or harm before a criminal is apprehended.  In that vein, grand jurors are instructed to keep the proceedings absolutely secret. They are compelled to not discuss the case or evidence with anyone, other than with other jurors during deliberations.   \n\nBecause the process is secret, the accused does not have a right to present evidence of his or her defense, or even be informed of the proceedings.  No defense attorney is present at the proceedings.    \n\n**How does a grand jury decide whether to bring an indictment?**   \nTypically, the prosecutors present evidence. This can be witness testimony, documents, or other tangible evidence.  The jurors sit and take notes about the evidence.  Sometimes, this process takes weeks or months. Once the jurors hear the evidence, they are read the proposed charges.  They then deliberate among themselves as to whether  there is enough evidence for an indictment.  \n\nA grand jury is instructed to return an indictment if the probable cause standard has been met.  Probable cause occurs when there allegations are "supported by circumstances sufficiently strong to justify a prudent and cautious person\'s belief that certain facts are probably true."\n\nProbable cause is considered the lowest legal burden in the US justice system. \n\n**Edit:** *If you are ever summoned to participate on a jury, please do it.  Don\'t make up a reason to get kicked off or get out because it\'s boring, or inconvenient, or you have better things to do.  Even if it isn\'t an exciting case.  Even if it\'s a civil trial and not a criminal trial.  Listen, keep an open mind, follow the instructions, and be polite to your fellow jury members.  Answer voir dire questions honestly.  Be willing to hear the evidence and change your mind when discussing the evidence with other jurors.  Respect the jurors, even if they\'re not like you. Remember that the lawyers and judges and witnesses are humans too.  Participating in jury duty is one of the most sacred, important civic duties you have as a citizen.  Don\'t award money just because the defendant might have it; don\'t find someone guilty unless the instructions have been met.  Juries are one of the most important pieces of our judicial system and distinguish us from other nations. It is your patriotic duty as an American to take the obligation seriously and serve when called.*  '

Investigations are how we do our due diligence and try to make sure that the people who go to trial are guilty. That means, by necessity, there are people who are investigated for crimes that they did not commit.\n\nBut, you say, a grand jury is a big deal! It absolutely is. And wouldn\'t it be a big deal if the grand jury concluded there wasn\'t enough evidence to indict anyone?\n\nWhat would have happened if the FBI had presented their investigation of Clinton to a grand jury, and it had been the grand jury that said "no reasonable prosecutor would bring this to trial" rather than former director Comey?\n\nIf you were Mueller, and it turns out that Trump and his campaign actually are innocent, how would you get the country to accept that? Sure, there\'s the ~30% of people who still support the President, but what about the other ~70%?\n\nI\'m not saying that\'s definitely what\'s happening, I\'m just cautioning prudence.

'I found it so weird that Trump is still holding campaign rallies when 2020 is so far away but it is obvious that he only does it for self gratification. It is the only way he can get applause, from people that have paid money for a ticket to be there (which funds in 2020 campaign). I feel like the only thing Trump does is Tweet, watch Cable News, Speak at Rallies in Pro-Trump cities, and Golfs at one of his resorts. When is he ever going to actually do his job as President?'

"If he is cooperating, this is more interesting (IMO) than cooperation by Manafort. Because Flynn was actually a part of the Trump Administration, he knows who knows about any criminal acts (i.e. Pence) whereas DJ Pauly M would only know the binary did collusion occur/did collusion not occur. \n\nOut of all of this, I'm still the most interested in what Pence knows/how he found out. Out of all the players in this, Pence entered with zero motivation to work with the Russians - no financial or urination-based ties. So, if collusion actually occurred, how did Trump convince Pence to be complicit in it? Remember when Trump was reported having second thoughts about having Pence on the ticket with him? Was Pence pushing back on this? Why did that stop?"
'Happy Flipsgiving!'
'A Happy Mueller Thanksgiving!'
">  Lawyers for Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser, notified the president’s legal team in recent days that they could no longer discuss the special counsel’s investigation, \n\n> The notification alone does not prove that Mr. Flynn is cooperating with Mr. Mueller. Some lawyers withdraw from information-sharing arrangements as soon as they begin negotiating with prosecutors. And such negotiations sometimes fall apart.\n\n> Still, the notification led Mr. Trump’s lawyers to believe that Mr. Flynn — who, along with his son, is seen as having significant criminal exposure — has, at the least, begun discussions with Mr. Mueller about cooperating.\n\n-\n\n> Mr. Flynn is regarded as loyal to Mr. Trump, but he has in recent weeks expressed serious concerns to friends that prosecutors will bring charges against his son, Michael Flynn Jr., who served as his father’s chief of staff and was a part of several financial deals involving the elder Mr. Flynn that Mr. Mueller is scrutinizing.\n\nThis is not the news the Trump clan was hoping for this Thankgiving.  Especially Kushner.  I'm thankful that the backchannel proposition is still a major focus:\n\n> Among the interactions that Mr. Mueller is investigating is a private meeting that Mr. Flynn had with the Russian ambassador and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, during the presidential transition. In the past year, it has been revealed that the Trump campaign repeatedly tried to meet with Russian officials who were promising compromising information on Mrs. Clinton.\n"

'> Defense lawyers frequently share information during investigations, but they must stop when doing so would pose a conflict of interest.

' Now the GOP cannot claim they see no reason to protect Mueller. With this story and the Rosenstien rumor they absolutely have reason to protect Mueller. Do not pass it off as GOP incompetence, laziness, being too busy or whatever other excuse some may use. They have no reason NOT to protect Mueller. This is now the 2nd time we\'ve heard about Trump wanting to fire Mueller and it is now perfectly clear. Protect an awarded Vietnam veteran, the former FBI Director with decades of ethical, professional conduct and devotion to his country, a man that  *or* protect a criminal. \n\nJust his military career below (from Wikipedia)\n\n> For his service in and during the Vietnam War, his military decorations and awards include: the Bronze Star Medal with Combat "V", Purple Heart Medal, two Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medals with Combat "V", Combat Action Ribbon, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal with three service stars, Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross, Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, and Parachutist Badge.

'The GOP is going to find themselves in a no-win situation. Trump fires Mueller and it’ll force impeachment.  If Muellers investigation concludes, its almost a guarantee they’ll be enough to warrant impeachment. If they wait too long, the Dems will likely have the House next January and....they’ll proceed with impeachment.\n\nSo, the way I see it, the “best” option for the GOP (note: not the best option for the country) is if they impeach now and hope they don’t have enough support to remove and if / when Dems take control, they’ll try to say they’ve already tried to impeach and use it as an excuse to “move on”. \n\nIn short:  Impeachment seems inevitable.  What is still to be determined is when it happens, what the Articles will be and if 15-17 GOP Senators will join the Dems to remove. '

'I just watched Frost/Nixon.\n\nI actually appreciate Nixon, he at least confessed and generally realized he had committed crimes. Trump is straight up Benedict Arnold Traitor category. Nixon would have never done that. Never thought I would compare Nixon favorably to ANYONE'
"If Trump doesn't testify under oath it's just more evidence that he's nothing but a coward. The fact he'd rather listen to his lawyers instead of just trying to solve things in one go shows he's a coward that's not worth being supported. \n\nHe talks big but when push comes to shove he crumbles faster than the Berlin Wall.

Let's not forget that the government has all of Trump's taxes, that right there by itself is likely a mine field. The only issue with Trump himself though is that, unlike Manafort, he can more readily put the blame on subordinates. There is zero chance - **zero** - that Trump is clean. \n\nBut we are likely at a point in American society where that doesn't mean what it used to.

'Recommended reading: ["Inside the Trump Bunker, With Days to Go"](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-27/inside-the-trump-bunker-with-12-days-to-go) from October 26, 2016:\n\n>If Trump wants to strengthen his hold on his base, then his apocalyptic rhetoric on the stump begins to make more sense. Lately he’s sounded less like a candidate seeking to persuade moderates and swing voters and more like the far-right populist leaders who’ve risen throughout Europe. Most Republican Party officials ardently hope he’ll go away quietly if he loses.\n\n-\n\n>To compensate for this, Trump’s campaign has devised another strategy, which, not surprisingly, is negative. Instead of expanding the electorate, Bannon and his team are trying to shrink it. **“We have three major voter suppression operations under way,”** says a senior official. They’re aimed at three groups Clinton needs to win overwhelmingly: idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans.\n\n-\n\n>In San Antonio, a young staffer showed off a South Park-style animation he’d created of Clinton delivering the “super predator” line (using audio from her original 1996 sound bite), as cartoon text popped up around her: “Hillary Thinks African Americans are Super Predators.” The animation will be delivered to certain African American voters through Facebook “dark posts”—nonpublic posts whose viewership the campaign controls so that, as Parscale puts it, “only the people we want to see it, see it.” The aim is to depress Clinton’s vote total. “We know because we’ve modeled this,” says the official. “It will dramatically affect her ability to turn these people out.”\n\n-\n\n>Regardless of whether this works or backfires, setting back GOP efforts to attract women and minorities even further, Trump won’t come away from the presidential election empty-handed. Although his operation lags previous campaigns in many areas (its ground game, television ad buys, money raised from large donors), it’s excelled at one thing: building an audience. Powered by Project Alamo and data supplied by the RNC and Cambridge Analytica, his team is spending $70 million a month, much of it to cultivate a universe of millions of fervent Trump supporters, many of them reached through Facebook. By Election Day, the campaign expects to have captured 12 million to 14 million e-mail addresses and contact information (including credit card numbers) for 2.5 million small-dollar donors, who together will have ponied up almost $275 million. “I wouldn’t have come aboard, even for Trump, if I hadn’t known they were building this massive Facebook and data engine,” says Bannon. **“Facebook is what propelled Breitbart to a massive audience. We know its power.”**\n\n-\n\n>Whatever Trump decides, this group will influence Republican politics going forward. These voters, whom Cambridge Analytica has categorized as “disenfranchised new Republicans,” are younger, more populist and rural—and also angry, active, and fiercely loyal to Trump. Capturing their loyalty was the campaign’s goal all along. It’s why, even if Trump loses, his team thinks it’s smarter than political professionals. “We knew how valuable this would be from the outset,” says Parscale. **“We own the future of the Republican Party.”**'

'I\'d love to see some New Year\'s indictments, but it doesn\'t seem like that\'s in the cards just yet.\n\n----\n\n>Special counsel Robert Mueller has begun to question Republican National Committee staffers about the party\'s 2016 campaign data operation, which helped President Donald Trump\'s campaign team target voters in critical swing states.\n\n>Two sources told\xa0[Yahoo News](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mueller-probe-outgrows-witch-hunt-phase-100045988.html)\xa0that Mueller\'s team is examining whether the joint RNC-Trump campaign data operation - which was directed on Trump\'s side by Brad Parscale and managed by Trump\'s son-in-law Jared Kushner - "was\xa0related to the activities of Russian trolls and bots aimed at influencing the American electorate."\n\n>....\n\n>It is not surprising that federal investigators have begun to examine the possibility that Russia and the Trump campaign helped each other during the election. Investigators have been looking into whether Russia provided the campaign\xa0with voter information stolen by Russian hackers\xa0from election databases in several states, and whether the Trump campaign helped Russia target its political ads to specific demographics and voting precincts.\n\n>The general counsels for Facebook, Twitter, and Google\xa0gave enigmatic replies\xa0when asked by the House Intelligence Committee last month whether they had investigated "who was mimicking who" when it came to online ads promoted by both the Trump campaign and Russia during the election.\n\n>Facebook said in September that\xa0about 25% of the ads purchased\xa0by Russians during the election "were geographically targeted," though many analysts have said they find it difficult to believe that foreign entities would have had the kind of granular knowledge of American politics necessary to target specific demographics and voting precincts.\n\n>...\n\n>Investigators have long wondered whether the data-mining and analysis firm Cambridge Analytica served as a link between the campaign\'s data operation and Russia.\nThat scrutiny intensified following revelations that Cambridge CEO Alexander Nix reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in June 2016 asking for access to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\'s "stolen" emails.\n\n>It is still unclear how much Cambridge Analytica actually did for the campaign. Trump campaign aides and even current and former Cambridge employees\xa0have consistently tried to downplay its role.\n\n>Parscale was asked about Cambridge during his interview with the House Intelligence Committee in October.\xa0The ranking members of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees sent him a separate letter that month asking whether his firm received "information from a foreign government or foreign actor" at any point during the election.\n\n>The letter was also sent to Nix and the heads of Deep Root Analytics, TargetPoint Consulting, and The Data Trust - firms hired by the Republican National Committee last year to bolster the Trump campaign\'s data operation.\n\n>...\n\n>Whereas Deep Root, TargetPoint, and The Data Trust responded to the documents request, Nix did not.\n\n>Parscale\'s letter, meanwhile, mirrored those written by the RNC data firms and used virtually the same language - with one notable exception.\n\n>Whereas the firms\' letters included a line denying that they had had contact with any "foreign government or foreign actor," Parscale\'s did not.\n\n\n\n\n'
">The report indicates that Mueller may be homing in on yet another facet of Russia's election interference — its social media influence campaign and **targeted political advertising**.\n\nThis is tied to money laundering.\n\nPour the foreign money into US-based advertising companies, then direct the ad companies spend the foreign money running ads compelling US citizens to send *domestic* money to the candidate's pet PAC. It's trading dirty money for clean money at one of the better laundering rates on the planet, but relies on nobody looking into it since the dirty money has to be snuck in somewhere, and money *always* leaves a trail (for now).\n\nNot everyone has to be in on it either. While I'm no expert on the case, the way it looks to be shaking out is that Manafort brought most/all of the money, so it's plausible that the ad agencies were getting legit checks to do legal work. Or maybe the ad agencies were in on it and the money was coming directly from foreign banks/buyers, but they weren't telling Facebook/Google/Twitter where their money was coming from. Or maybe Facebook/Google/Twitter knew - or even received foreign money directly - but they definitely weren't telling the voter that the paid-for ad to send money to Trump was bought with Putin cash as a vehicle to move clean US dollars directly to Trump (and future interests too, those legal PACs are still loaded and ready to spend in 2018).\n\nIt's basically a SarahPAC Shuffle, but instead of the candidate and their family building the vehicle to live like trash off dumb-as-rocks US citizen donations for the rest of their lives, in Trump's case the seed money came courtesy of Vladimir and the goals are a lot more lofty than being able to afford the good meth."
"2018 only saves us if Democrats absolutely trounce Republicans in the popular vote. The Republicans have gerrymandered so many House districts to such a degree it's quite literally possible for the Democrats to win the popular vote by as much as 10% and still find themselves in the minority.\n\nNOBODY can afford to sit this one out.\nIf you have the time and resources to, and have EVER considered volunteering for a campaign... the country needs you desperately.\n\nHeck, if you are qualified to run for office and have any desire to do so...  \nPLEASE run for office to help preserve our American political tradition.  \nThere is still more than enough time in virtually every state and it really is true that every single political office counts for something and needs to be contested.  \nEven if you are in a place where your party tends to get trounced things are far from hopeless.  You would be surprised how much running a great campaign can overcome partisan politics, particularly locally.  \nAnd quite frankly, you never know if your opponent is going to turn out to be the next Roy Moore.  \nNearly every cycle some House candidate blows an easy re-election due to scandal.\n\nHere is a website for an organisation dedicated to helping new candidates...  https://www.runforsomething.net/\n\nAnd this page provides links to the website for each state's Secretary of State...  links to register as a candidate will typically be contained somewhere on these sites... https://www.thebalance.com/secretary-of-state-websites-1201005\n\nNow the Senate will require the near equivalent of a no-hitter... there are at least four or five winnable Senate seats without requiring a Roy Moore situation, but only two of them are realistic in anything except an inverse 2010 type wave election.\n\nCombine their gerrymandering, regularly ignoring FOIA requests, avoiding constituents, trying to discredit American law and intelligence agencies, pushing judge nominees with zero experience and now calls to 'purge' the FBI and CIA... it's becoming very obvious that there is a large faction within the Republican Party that has no respect at all for American political traditions and it's enlightenment-based founding principles but intend on doing whatever is needed to gain total and permanent control of the levers-of-state regardless of law or public sentiment.\n\nFor those who I heard for years claim that politics was all theater and the person in the White House was irrelevant to the course of American policymaking... there is a damn good reason certain folks were very happy to support that notion. And those people don't want folks who genuinely question everything voting.\n\nThose people now control the entire federal government, in large part thanks to millions of you sitting out every time an election came along... but now we have an opportunity to put things right.\n\nGet angry, get loud... and most importantly of all, get out there and do whatever we can to restore genuine law and order to our country.\n\n"

'I want more "Witch Hunts" more often. We\'re uncovering to much shit. If independent investigations turn into a way to hold our representatives accountable, I think that\'s great.

"It may be just me, but when a highly resoected former top level British spy puts something into a dossier that hes being paid a lot of money to research its pretty safe to assume he actually did his homework didn't just trust the rumors he was hearing.

"At this point, if you're still a republican then you deserve less respect than I give my dog, considering you are less intelligent than him.  "
"All these reports make it sound as though Mueller is a Terminator-like robot who was designed specifically to investigate federal crimes and dish out indictments.  \n\nI really hope he's as ruthlessly efficient as all these claims say.  Considering how it only took him less than 1 year to indict Manafort and Gates, as well as get guilty pleas from Papadapoulos and Flynn, I guess he and his team are deserving of their reputation."
'I would love to be questioned by Mueller, would be the proudest day of my life.  But then I’ve never committed crimes so I have nothing to fear.'
'if the investigation continues to the end...we are all going to be very surprised by how much the GOP has gotten in bed with Russia ( well, some will be surprised, the rest will be "ha! told you so!")'
"To me this is the thing that could most easily bring down Trump if it's true because it's so data based. It's simple: if Russia's targeting matches CA's data, it's game over, and this is something that should be very knowable. The key thing then becomes who gave it to them. "
'If the whole top of the party was in on the collusion, it explains neatly why everyone is ready to fall on their swords for him.'
'hmm, iirc it was later confirmed for every single thing that sources in the past told the press about the Mueller operation, that it was already weeks old at that point.  \nDoes that mean that this is already weeks old, too?

"Oooooh, and the Mercers! I'd love to see *them* in bright orange and handcuffs. "
"The truly greatest move Mueller could make is demoloshing the GOP. Going after Trump would just be treating a symptom (a very bad one) and not fixing the cause. \n\nIf Mueller deals a serious blow by mid next year and the legislative branch can swing to democratic control, rule of law would be reestablished and Trump wouldn't be able to hide behind the protection of an obstructionist congress. The rest of the convicts in the Republican party would also be rooted out. What's risked by axing Trump is that the GOP can jump on that bandwagon and throw him under the bus to take all the heat for them and the reason why someone like Trump came into power would still exist. "
"Jared's gonna take the fall for all of this and Trump get off scot free. that is what I am worried about (even though I am sure Jared deserves it, I just don't want Trump to squirm his way out of it). The idea Trump wouldn't have known about any of these dealings with Russians is just unbelievable. "
"I remember before and during the primaries--the establishment Republicans were supporting basically anyone *but* Trump, until all others were knocked out of primary contention. I wonder what happened behind closed doors at the RNC. Did they have a hand in moving the primaries toward Trump? Or did they learn about--and accept--the election meddling strategy only after Trump made his way to the nomination? Either way, things don't look good for them."

He knows that if he sets foot on U.S. soil, his ass will be under indictment so fast it\'d make his head spin comically. \n\nMueller deserves a national god-damn holiday when this is all done. We should have a day celebrating the work of Mueller, Woodward, and Bernstein. Their work saved our nation. *knocks on wood*'

This [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2015/07/donald-ivana-trump-divorce-prenup-marie-brenner) article set the stage for what would essentially become the shit show you are currently experiencing today. Social media influencing has been hinted at [since 1999](https://www.c-span.org/video/?153873-1/trump-presidential-campaign) when Roger Stone was helping Trump’s first presidential bid, goddamnit HOW did we not see it??!?!? Donald Trump, along with his cabal of criminals, was [accused in 2012](http://eqs.fec.gov/eqsdocsMUR/13044334657.pdf) of exploiting campaign finance laws by “testing the waters” re: a 2012 presidential bid. Around 2011, Cohen made a [website](http://web.archive.org/web/20110429020811/http://shouldtrumprun.com/) back then aimed at Middle Americans inciting dissidence against Obama based on common Russian talking points, but most importantly, asking them if trump should run for presidency. It was around this time that Trump began [tweeting himself](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/28502098983260160?s=21) peddling his segments on FOX as well as the website.

">It includes the identities of cooperating individuals and companies, as well as links between the defendants, uncharged parties and foreign governments, that goes well beyond what prosecutors intend to disclose at trial, they wrote. They said they gave additional details to U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich under court seal.\n  \n>Prosecutors asked Friedrich to bar any co-defendant of Concord from reviewing evidence until they appear in his courtroom to respond to the charges. They also want to regulate disclosure of “particularly sensitive material to foreign nationals” by first limiting it to U.S. lawyers for defendants.\n  \nThis is masterfully well crafted by Mueller's team and is a strong message to others as well as Putin's cronies, that he's not fucking around. \n  \nThis was a litmus test of two heavyweights sizing each other up. Remember, Concord said unless they provide them with all intelligence gathered by the USA on Russia and the previous Soviet Union since 1945; the judge should toss out the case on the technicality. The judge also expedited the time frame in which Mueller's team had to plead their case for the validity for bringing forth these charges, giving them only a week to respond. This will also provide a better idea in terms of the  transparency of how this judge is going to conduct this case and if they will do so independently without any political preconceived bias one way or another."

It puts Republicans in a huge no-win situation.\n\nEither they refuse to vote, which continues to fuel the fire in Democrats' bellies about voting their asses out in November, OR they hold a vote, and everyone gets to see, in the public record, who actually cares about legitimate investigations.

"I'm pretty convinced the GOP, as an entity, has very little interest in protecting Mueller from Trump other than via empty rhetoric and a collectively 'furrowed brow'.

Or that his evidence is either fake or politically motivated? And he should be removed even though his team successfully argued to a judge that attorney-client privilege should be waived, which is a big fucking deal?  \n  \nIt's almost as if these crazies don't understand the law, how the grand jury process works, or how thorough those in law enforcement/DOJ have to be in order to bring charges in a case like this.

"Certified boom from Ben Wittes.  \n  \nI've been wondering when Sessions would be interviewed by Mueller. Just from what's in the public record (open hearings in Congress, what's been reported, etc.), Sessions has as much criminal liability as anybody. My bet is that he likely sings like an alto when looking down the gun of multiple obstruction indictments. It's been so open and brazen I wondered when it'd come out.  \n  \nI'm hoping Trump actually did tape conversations like Nixon did. I'd love to be a fly on the wall during the one where Trump screamed at Sessions about JFK/RFK.  \n  \nSessions: Well, uh, sir, I can't just, er, kill the investigation.  \n  \nTrump: YOU'RE MY ATTORNEY GENERAL, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FUCKING PROTECT ME!  \n  \nSessions: Sir, I can't exactly do that.\n  \nTrump: YOU HAVE TO PROTECT ME LIKE BOBBY KENNEDY DID FOR JACK!  \n  \nSessions: The Justice Depahrtment did pass laws against that after Johnson was president...  \n  \nTrump: PROTECT ME LIKE BOBBY.  \n  \nSessions: Er-  \n  \nTrump: LIKE BOBBY KENNEDY, JEFF."
"As is tradition when news about Mueller come out:\n\n>Our Mueller,\n\n>Who art in the Beltway,\n\n>Harrowing be thy name.\n\n>Thy justice come,\n\n>Thy case be won\n\n>In court as it is in public.\n\n>Give us this day our daily drip\n\n>And forgive us our speculations,\n\n>As we forgive those who speculate against us.\n\n>For thine is the investigation, and the power, and the duty.\n\n>A spokesman for Mueller's office declined to comment.\n\n"
'I never imagined that I could genuinely despise anyone as much as I despise Trump and his cronies. \n\nCan Mueller please lock all these traitors up. They need to be paraded down Pennsylvania Avenue in handcuffs. I await that moment. Definitely taking a week off to celebrate America’s victory. '
"Worth pointing out: Sessions is a lot of things (like a racist Keebler elf with a Napoleon complex), but he *is* a lawyer and he is *not* stupid.\n\nIf Mueller's team interviewed him they are pretty far into this. They wouldn't risk letting him piece it all together otherwise."
'When Trump asked "Do you want a president that\'ll be besieged by FBI investigations?", little did people know he was referring to himself and not HRC. Which is quite ironic because if this was HRC under investigation you can bet it wouldn\'t affect her ability to get things done. Meanwhile Trump can\'t go a couple of days without trying to tear down our democratic institutions. HRC was, arguably, robbed of a chance to be POTUs by Jim Comey and thus far she has yet to cast aspersions on the entire FBI or the justice department.'

'[Direct link to the indictment](https://www.justice.gov/file/1070306/download).

The witnesses are "D1" and "D2".)\n\n* 7: Conspiracy to Obstruct Justice (also the witness tampering)\n\nThe below is my interpretation of the document, unless directly quoted. I am not a lawyer.\n\ntl;dr on the money laundering stuff, Manafort was being paid tens of millions of dollars for his work promoting the Ukrainian pro-Russia government. In order to obfuscate the source of this money and to avoid paying taxes on it, he disguised it as "loans" from various companies and banks *he and his people* set up.\n\nThe indictment also refers quite a bit on pages 3, 22, and 23 to Manafort\'s work with Konstantin Kilimnik, aka "Person A". [Here\'s an excellent article about him.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/06/the-astonishing-tale-of-the-man-mueller-calls-person-a/562217/) I believe this document is the first to explicitly name Kilimnik as a defendant in Mueller\'s probe. [This CNN article](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/08/politics/paul-manafort-indictment-robert-mueller/index.html) seems to imply so, too.\n\n---\n\nPage 2:\n\n> Manafort, with the assistance of Gates, funneled millions of dollars in payments into numerous foreign nominee companies and bank accounts, opened by them and their accomplices in nominee names and in various foreign countries, including Cyprus, Saint Vincent & the Grenadines, and the **Seychelles**.\n\nHighlighted the Seychelles because it\'s just funny how many of these threads seem to involve the same locations and people, even if they\'re seemingly not connected. For anyone who forgot, [there\'s another leg of this investigation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/mueller-gathers-evidence-that-2016-seychelles-meeting-was-effort-to-establish-back-channel-to-kremlin/2018/03/07/b6a5fb8c-224b-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html?utm_term=.8bc3db2c369a) involving the Seychelles.\n\n---\n\nPage 3: \n\n> In total, more than $75,000,000 flowed through these offshore accounts.\n\n---\n\nPage 17:\n\n> In February 2012, Manafort, with the assistance of Gates, solicited two Washington, D.C. firms (Company A and company B) to lobby in the United States on behalf of Yanukovych, the Party of Regions, and the Government of Ukraine. For instance, Gates wrote to Company A that it would be "**representing the Government of Ukraine in [Washington] DC.**"\n\nThey *explicitly told these people* they were representing Ukraine, all while telling the US government otherwise.\n\n---\n\nPage 19:\n\n> "Our [Manafort and Gates\'] task was to assist the [Centre to] find representation in Washington, but at no time did our firm or members provide direct lobbying support."\n\nThe evidence on page 17 proves that Gates was lying on page 19.\n\n---\n\nPage 22-23, regarding his attempts to obfuscate his links to the pro-Russian Ukrainian government:\n\n> Manafort explained in an "eyes only" memorandum created in or about June 2012 that the purpose of the "super VIP" effort would be to "assemble a small group of high-level European highly influencial [sic] champions and politically credible friends who can act informally and without any visible relationship with the Government of Ukraine."\n\n---\n\nPage 30 explains that the United States is seeking forfeiture of more of his properties and assets. Including properties in New York City, and Arlington, Virginia.'
'Sure is a funny coincidence that all these criminals would be surrounding and supporting a totally innocent man.'
'It\'s worth pointing out, Manafort\'s indictment is for activities from 2006 through 2017, well past the campaign and into Trump\'s presidency.  And the indictment of the "former" GRU agent is huge, especially if it opens the possibility he could turn state evidence.'
"Pretty sure Trump is gonna have a hard time keeping his word that he isn't going to be talking about the Russia probe for a few days."
'Happy Friday, Everyone!'
'So far Mueller has found nothing, except conspiracy to obstruct justice, obstruction of justice, conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, failure to register as an agent of a foreign principal, false and misleading FARA statements, and false statements.'

"Obama wasn't allowed to appoint a supreme court justice in his final year as president, so I don't see why Donald should have been allowed to."
"Or, just add judicial positions once Trump is out of office, starting with 2 positions on the Supreme Court- one for Garland and one for a justice to countermand the illegally placed Gorusch.\n\nMaking the SC 11 would just take presidential nomination and Senate confirmation, you don't have to wait for a vacancy.\n"
"And Gorsuch wouldn't even be on the Supreme Court if Mitch McConnell hadn't been such a classless hyperpartisan and ignored Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court a full 11 months before the next president would take office. Furthermore, I think we all know that if the tables were turned and there were a Supreme Court vacancy in a GOP-controlled Senate in early 2020, Mitch McConnell wouldn't blink before voting to seat Trump's (or Pence's) nominee."
"Or, since having a foreign leader's puppet as President (possibly illegitimately) is unprecedented, we can take unprecedented steps to reverse Trump's decisions. All of them. Sure it's never been done before, but we're in uncharted waters here. By definition the fix we need will have never been tried before either.\n\nEdit: it's not conspiracy theory that Russia interfered in the election. Before you PM that it is, maybe you should also email every intelligence agency in the US first and argue it with them. "
"I know it sucks that he's stacking the courts, but I am-- we *all* should be-- **100% against disallowing the President to fulfill their duties just because they're under investigation**\n\nThis is one of those things that sounds great when it works in our favor, but it *will* bite us in the ass if we say that any President under investigation isn't allowed to act as President.\n\nAs the top comment points out, Obama was effectively blocked from doing his duties, and it wasn't cool then. It won't be cool now, either."
'If we wanted any government influence, we should have fucking voted and won the election. We reaped what we sowed when we let people equate Hillary and Trump.'
'Yeah. Good luck with that.'
"This is insane.\n\nHere's how you gain power back: build a better platform, promote successful candidates, win elections.\n\nThese articles are absolutely juvenile. They don't like current positions that are being taken and their response is to throw hissy fits. Despite what everyone thinks, Trump is not the end of the world. He is doing what every single other conservative President would be doing at this time, he's just doing it in a blustery/annoying/douchey/whatever you want to call it way."
'Lol what a novel idea. Let’s just force a counsel on every politician we don’t like so they can never do anything. \n\nRemind me what mueller has found on our president so far?  On him specifically?  I’ll wait. '
"This is the great thing about a separate legislator, that the president is only nominating court appointments to be approved by congress. \n\nUnfortunately, for people on the left, the one thing all conservatives like about Trump is his court appointments and congress hasn't had a single issue with them so far. They aren't going to vote down their dream court candidates on principle."

'Pretty sure adding staff is a sign that the investigation is a nothingburger still /s'
"I personally would find it very funny if Mueller had this whole thing wrapped up months ago and is just bringing people on to do random chores around his house. Weissman is doing his taxes, the new guy is setting up his Wifi, someone else is dusting his shelves, vacuuming, cleaning out his cat's litter box, finishing off his grocery list, stuff like that."

Then after the Jr. meeting in the tower it ramps up significantly. \n\nhttp://www.ljean.com/NetworkData.php\n\nEdit: I can't look right now but I may be off on my timing on that first part with the Mayflower. It may have started  just before, not just after. I'll edit again when I get a chance to go through my history and find my old timeline. \n\nEdit2: OK here's the timeline I put together 6 months ago. Pretty eye opening. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6n8ctu/russian_lawyer_brought_exsoviet_counter/dk7nsom/?context=3\n\nIt's a pretty long post, so here's the gist\n\n> May 4 is the first set of traffic, one week after the meeting. See ns2_cdcservices_com.log. Also that log does have traffic on June 9 at 13:44:53."

"The best thing about this is it happened in early November and we're just finding out about it now. It's like papadopoulos. No one knew. What else does mueller know/have? "
"So we had to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is a huge problem. I have a son—he’s 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers. It’s unbelievable. As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we’re not. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe, it's hardly doable. But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that’s true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester. And certainly cyber is one of them."
'Is it Baron?  He’s great with the cyber.'
"Man when Mueller strikes, I'm hoping it to be glorious. He's been silent, not saying much about what he's doing, but i bet hes doing a great job after looking at his team."

"It'd be awesome if he could think he's avoiding it, get on Air Force One, they take off, he goes to hide in his room and BAM - there's Mueller, waiting for him.  Unrealistic, but it'd still be awesome.  "
'Anyone thinking Trump is ready to face Mueller should read this:  https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-25/i-ve-watched-trump-testify-under-oath-it-isn-t-pretty\n\nBottom line is, despite all the bluster from Trumpland, his lawyers aren’t idiots. They know the minute Trump is put under oath he’s toast. Simply because even if he didn’t collude with the Russians (and I don’t think he knowingly did), it’d be too easy to nail him on obstruction, money laundering, and probably the half-dozen other things that he absolutely did. \n\nWorse, he just doesn’t have the mental faculties to match wits with the Bob Mueller’s of the world, so he’d probably end up admitting wrongdoing and not even be aware of it. '
'I thought Trump was looking forward to his little chat w Mueller?! \nI guess he was being honest again. Everything he says is like Opposite Day. I feel like this is opposite year... is this real life, or some glitch in second life. '
'Yeah this doesn’t look like something a cognizant, innocent president would do'
"Trump wants to testify under oath to clear his name, but those damn bureaucrats keep messing things up for common men like him. Aw shucks.\n\nWell, he couldn't testify (because of Jew lawyers) but he was willing to, and if that's not enough to convince you of his innocence, well then you just have it in for him. "
"This isn't that bad. I'm no Trump supporter, but every lawyer's job is to make sure they pursue every avenue of limiting the strength of their opponent's argument. This is what I'd expect them to do, even if Trump were 100% innocent."
'Good luck with that Fucko'
'"The fifth amendment would be a public relations nightmare."\n\nCan\'t see it being more of a PR nightmare than say, having an affair with a porn star while your wife is at home with a newborn.  That thing Trump said about shooting someone in the middle of 5th Ave (or wherever) seems like the truest pronouncement ever to pass his lips.'
'Odds are this is inconsequential to the case Mueller is building.  He knows full well that Donnie will stonewall him.  As it is said, prosecutors don’t ask questions they don’t already know the answers to.  Or he’s giving Donnie the chance to provide a motive other than the One Mueller has decided upon.  \n\nIn the end though an interview is just a way to tighten the noose further.  Mueller knows Trump isn’t going to provide any information.  But his refusal to be interviewed would also play into Mueller’s hand.  If the offer is never extended then Mueller gets accused of never hearing trump’s side of the story before rendering judgement.\n\nTo;dr there won’t be an interview and mueller knew this before he offered and Donnie is already sunk.'
'Normally I’d be fine with anyone trying to take advantage of every legal opportunity they are allowed to help in an investigation or trial. We all have that right, even the President. But when the President is working not to have to answer questions it’s really not a good look. It’s another example that when you’re president there can be a big difference between what you can do and what you should do.  '
"Y'know, maybe if he wasn't breaking the law, he wouldn't need to have a legal team looking for precedents and loop holes to get him out of it.  I know Conservatives are bleating that this is all a sham and he's innocent but if that's true, then why does he need a legal team to get him out of answering questions under oath?"
'can we start calling it "wildly successful" \n\nRobert Mueller\'s wildly successful investigation'
'In some ways, this is a good sign.\n\nWhen high profile convictions start rolling, people will hopefully finally fucking realize the president is a criminal.'
'Most redditors are too young, but the Iran-Contra uncovered crimes by the Reagan Administration. But Reagan is still beloved by voters.'
'I assume that is because people implicitly take the question as crimes related to the fabricated Russian collusion narrative where there is a grand total of 0 indictments.  Nobody cares about process crimes.'
'I feel like “Most Americans” know almost nothing beyond reality TV and super hero movies unfortunately.\n\nSource: Am American'
'I wish that survey had a "don\'t know" option. As presented, anyone who doesn\'t know would answer \'no\'. But so would everyone who (incorrectly) believes that it has uncovered no criminal activity. I\'d be very interested in seeing the breakdown between those answers. A big chunk of "I don\'t know" suggests that people just aren\'t following the news, while a large percentage of actual "no" answers suggests that people have been actively misinformed.\n\nThat\'s a valuable distinction. '
'I STILL fail to comprehend how Trump supporters STILL keep saying "but NOTHING that proves collusion "\n\n\n..... on an ONGOING investigation.\n\n\nReally, do you think that you are entitled to be on Mueller\'s contact list?\n\nDo They really believe that Mueller directs this investigation saying "ack.. I  forgot to send \'MAGATrumplover72\' an email to let them know how things are going, better get on that. '
"but no collusion! and even if there was, it's not a crime! and even if it is a crime, Putin was just an unpaid intern."
'What you people seem to forget is that the investigation is not seen as a real threat. This has been a year long investigation and trump supporters, myself included, have seen no real indication of collusion. Those are BS crimes that would be found in a year long investigation for any administration for the most part. If there was clear cut evidence discovered, then the immediate next move would be a motion for articles of impeachment. I don\'t think anyone believes trump is a great person but he has fulfilled many of the promises he ran on which is why he has support. I still constantly hear that his base is stupid or uneducated which just shows that Democrats are in some delusional land where their ideology is the only "right"  way. It is not. I understand some of the Democrat POV on topics but I don\'t agree and I have valid reasons not too. This thread is an example of hiding in these echo chambers to try to convince yourself that you are right and down vote comments you don\'t like to oblivion.  '
'Worth noting this is a *grand jury* subpoena. From the [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/us/politics/steve-bannon-mueller-russia-subpoena.html):\n\n> Prosecutors generally prefer to interview witnesses before a grand jury when they believe they have information that the witnesses do not know or when they think they might catch the witnesses in a lie. It is much easier for a witness to stop the questioning or sidestep questions in an interview than during grand jury testimony, which is transcribed, and witnesses are required to answer every question.'
"[Renato Mariotti](https://twitter.com/renato_mariotti) thread about this.  He's a former federal prosecutor and candidate for AG in Illinois.\n\n>THREAD: Why did Mueller subpoena Bannon to testify before the grand jury?  How is that different from an informal interview with investigators? **(Short answer: He likely wants to question Bannon without Bannon's attorney present.)**\n\n>1/ As @nytimes reported above, Mueller subpoenaed Steve Bannon to testify before the grand jury. He's the first person in Trump's person in Trump's inner circle to be subpoenaed. Other White House staff agreed to be informally interviewed.\n\n>2/ Typically witnesses in an investigation like this one are interviewed informally, especially if they have their own attorney, as Bannon does. So this is a very unusual move.  It could mean a couple of things.\n\n>3/ First, federal prosecutors often will send over a grand jury subpoena as a first step to then negotiate the informal interview. Ultimately the subpoena is the leverage they have to get a subject to comply with an interview.\n\n>4/ I doubt that's what happened here because Bannon is represented by a skilled attorney who also represents Priebus and McGahn, who were already interviewed by Mueller. That means Mueller's team is already in touch with his attorney and has a relationship with him.\n\n>5/ If they called Bannon's attorney, he'd no doubt agree to an interview, because the alternative is a grand jury subpoena.  Why is testifying before the grand jury worse for someone being interviewed? Because their attorney can't be present in the room with them.\n\n>6/ **No one is allowed in the grand jury room other than the witness, the prosecutors, the grand jurors, and the court reporter. Also, the fact that there is a court reporter makes it easier for the prosecutor to charge the witness with making a false statement.**\n\n>7/ Typically, prosecutors also prefer the freewheeling informal interview, because they can ask a broader array of questions in a less tense setting, with a FBI agent present. Often defense lawyers can help their clients remember details by directing them to key documents.\n\n>8/ False statements in an informal interview can be prosecuted, as Papadopoulos and Flynn discovered. Typically the desire to prosecute false statements doesn't drive a decision to issue a grand jury subpoena.\n\n>9/ The most likely reason that Mueller prefers to have Bannon testify before the grand jury is because his attorney won't be present and it will be easier to catch Bannon off-guard and receive truthful answers. Testifying before a grand jury is intimidating.\n\n>10/ When I was a federal prosecutor, I didn't like when multiple witnesses in the same case had the same attorney, even though it was usually permissible. I was worried that the attorney would use their increased knowledge of the case to help the witnesses tailor their testimony.\n\n>11/ Mueller may be concerned that Bannon won't be as candid with his attorney present as he would be with no attorney in front of the grand jury. Grand jury questioning, with a court reporter, also lends itself to a harsher questioning style akin to cross-examination. /end"

'According to the NYT article:\n>The subpoena could be a negotiating tactic. Mr. Mueller is likely to allow Mr. Bannon to forgo the grand jury appearance if he agrees to instead be questioned by investigators in the less formal setting of the special counsel’s offices about ties between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia and about the president’s conduct in office, according to the person, who would not be named discussing the case. **But it was not clear why Mr. Mueller treated Mr. Bannon differently than the dozen administration officials who were interviewed in the final months of last year and were never served with a subpoena.**\n\nInteresting'
"I mean, who didn't see this one coming?\n\nAND it comes off the heels of Trump and the GOP burying Bannon six feet deep for daring to go against him after all of his help.\n\nHe's gonna sing like a canary and they all know it."
'As in other threads, I\'ll tell you what happened when I went through this.\n\nRecap:  I worked for a MAJOR online marketing company.  We were doing half a BILLION dollars a year,  (Google \'iworks\' and \'jeremey johnson\') with a staff of about 30.  When the shit hit the fan the Feds did all the same things to me that they\'re doing to Bannon and company.\n\nI was "invited" to appear before a Grand Jury by two FBI agents about a month after the first indictments came down.  Much like Bannon, I said I\'d rather not.  They responded with a subpoena. \n\nNeedless to say, they are experts at psychological warfare.  It\'s their job to break you mentally, financially, and emotionally.  They visited me at my new job, they called me constantly, and they made it fairly clear that I needed to decide which side I was on- the side that was cooperating, or the side that was going to Federal Prison.\n\nThis was a HUGE case here in Utah- it eventually took down **two** Attorney Generals, and implicated several high-level politicians in a corruption and bribery scheme.  Again, it\'s all online, and it\'s fascinating reading.  Less so when you were right in the middle of it.  But I digress.\n\nSo, since the case was so important, they actually opened up a temporary office in the city where iWorks was located.  A week before I was supposed to appear before the Grand Jury, an FBI agent calls me and says something like "Hey, we know *you* aren\'t the bad-guy here.  No need to interrupt your life.  We\'d just like some... *information.*  Why don\'t you swing by my office, and we\'ll clear this all up?"\n\nSee where this is going?\n\nSo, I drop by their office.  I\'m not bullshitting you here- they had biometric locks on the doors, you had to be buzzed in by camera, and I was searched before the meeting even started.\n\nSo, I sit down at this big table, and aside from me, there\'s the FBI guy, the Salt Lake County DA,  a woman from the DOJ, and three other "minor" attorneys.  You\'d have thought I was Al Capone.\n\nI went in to that meeting thinking I was going to hang tough, invoke my right to remain silent, and demand that my lawyer be present.\n\nI left that meeting having told them everything I knew, clear back to my exit from the womb.  I\'d drawn charts for them on their whiteboard.  I gave them names and phone numbers.  I offered them my harddrive.  I probably would have gotten down and blown them if it meant gaining their approval.\n\nSee, this is *what they do*.  They break people.  It\'s both an art and a science.  They\'ve done it for literally decades, and they\'ve refined it to perfection.  I don\'t care how bad-ass you think you are, if there is *anything* in your life that you care about, they\'ll use it against you.   Not directly, of course.  But trust me, you get the message very quickly.\n\nI never did appear before a Grand Jury.  I didn\'t have to- they knew they\'d wrung me dry.  I didn\'t even have to appear in the subsequent hearings- note I said "hearings", plural, because their were many of them.\n\nIn the end, the bosses went to prison, and are still there today.  It might interest you to know that NONE of them went to jail for fraud, which was the original charge.  The jury found them innocent on all counts of fraud.\n\nThey went to jail for "making false statements to a bank". \nWhen Trump goes down, it won\'t be for the reasons you think.  But he *will* go down. '

'>The president appeared to ease his anger toward Mr. Bannon at the end of last week. When asked in an interview with The Wall Street Journal whether his break with Mr. Bannon was “permanent,” the president replied, “I don’t know what the word ‘permanent’ means.”\n\nI thought he was being figurative when I first read this, like he was saying "I don\'t know the meaning of the word failure" but doesn\'t seem like it... from the interview:\n\n>WSJ: Is that relationship permanently broken between you and Steve?\nMr. Trump: You never know, you know again, the word—– I don’t know what the word permanent means, OK? I never know what the word permanent means. We’ll see what happens, but Steve had nothing to do with my win. Well, certainly very little.'

"> His attorneys also support a sit-down, as long as there are clear parameters and topics.\n\nI hope Mueller drags him in front of a grand jury.

Also present would be a team of the greatest prosecutors in the country.\n\nAnd every word is recorded and transcribed. "

Some details of the requests were first reported Wednesday afternoon by The New York Times.\n\n-\n\n------\n-\n\nAdditional details in WaPo story:\n\n* Cobb has been sending stuff over to Mueller over the last few weeks:\n\n* > Over the last few weeks, White House lawyer Ty Cobb began sending a series of records to the special counsel. Cobb is working within the White House to gather more of those documents and has told staff and other lawyers that he hoped to turn over many more this week.\n\n-\n\n* Mueller also asking White House for any Manafort emails/docs:\n\n* > Mueller also asked for any email or document the White House holds which relates to Manafort, the people briefed on the requests said. Manafort resigned from the campaign before the election, amid scrutiny of his work for a powerful Ukrainian political party aligned with the Russian government.\n\n-\n\n* Mueller asked for records regarding meetings with Sally Yates\n\n* > Mueller has also asked for records about meetings Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates held with White House Counsel Don McGahn in late January to alert him to Department of Justice concerns about Flynn and all documents related to Flynn’s subsequent firing by the White House.'
'Ok, real talk Trump supporters.\n\nCan you at least now admit that, at the very minimum, members of Trump\'s campaign team very likely broke the law in a serious manner? I\'m not even talking about Trump himself, I mean Flynn, Manafort, and probably others (Sessions?).\n\nIf this is true, how did Donald Trump not know about it? I thought he was only going to hire "the best people" with "extreme vetting". What kind of boss would let criminals on his team, knowing he himself may be directly or indirectly implicated by their criminal actions?\n\nIf any Trump supporter can please explain that to me, I\'d appreciate it.'
"Are you ready for a tweet storm? I'm ready for a tweet storm..."
'My goodness. I hope Mueller can just retire and sleep for months after he’s finished. '
'I love that photo of Drumpf & Lavrov in the Oval Office trying to out-orange each other.'
"I cannot wait until the word comes through and I finally get to grab my popcorn and finally get to watch the end of the Tea Party. Even if Mueller doesn't incarcerate everyone of them, the message has been sent. Trump tried to play his games with the highest office in the land, and it wont be allowed to happen anymore."
'Boy, I sure hope Trump dies in jail.'
'>Ty Cobb, the lawyer Mr. Trump hired to provide materials related to the Russia investigation to the special counsel and Congress, has told Mr. Mueller’s office that he will turn over many of the documents this week.\n\n>“We can’t comment on any specific requests being made or our conversations with the special counsel,’’ he said.\n\n"Unless I\'m eating at a steakhouse having a loud conversation where everyone can hear me. Then I can comment."'
'Looks like McGahn is going to have to crack open that safe. '
"I'm glad Mueller has been pretty quiet during this investigation. It seems like everyone is trying to make sure they have all the info they need for this case before letting people start shit."
"The Trump Administration is leaking like a busted pipe and I'm absolutely loving it. \n\nI hope the paranoia of knowing everything they say might find it's way to the papers slowly eats away at them. "
'[The Foreign Policy article cited within this one provides a bit more information.](http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/26/trump-launched-campaign-to-discredit-potential-fbi-witnesses/)\n\n>President Donald Trump pressed senior aides last June to devise and carry out a campaign to discredit senior FBI officials after learning that those specific employees were likely to be witnesses against him as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, according to two people directly familiar with the matter.\n\nThe senior officials that Trump allegedly targeted include:\n>Andrew McCabe, the current deputy FBI director and who was briefly acting FBI director after Comey’s firing\n\n#\n\n>Jim Rybicki, Comey’s chief of staff and senior counselor; and James Baker, formerly the FBI’s general counsel\n\n#\n\n>James Baker, formerly the FBI’s general counsel\n\nIt\'s clear that Trump conducted a campaign to discredit the FBI, however neither of these articles detail exactly what Trump had his staff do.\n\nTwo anonymous sources are cited.  If they are able to provide more information to Mueller and his team beyond "There was a smear campaign", it would be much easier to prove intent in an obstruction of justice case.\n\n>That Trump may have been motivated to attack specific FBI officials because they were potential witnesses against him could demonstrate potential intent that would bolster an obstruction of justice case. \n\nMy hope is that these sources can give more information to the special counsel investigation.'
'These are definitely the actions of an innocent person. '
'“Some people witnessed me trying to obstruct the investigation into my obstruction of justice. Guess I’d better discredit them to obstruct justice.” - Trump, apparently.'
"Man Trump is dumb. He just can't stop fucking himself, it's like he wants to commit the best, greatest bigly obstruction of justice in the history of a long long time, believe me."
"Dear Trump Enablers,\n\nYou're only safe so long as he finds you useful.  And even then you're probably fucked.\n\nPS:  This also applies to Trump supporters, but I'm sure you'll be singing his praises until the very moment it's *your* house he's burning down."
"Because that's how the GOP rolls.  Attack families, hero soldiers, children, minorities, FBI agents, but support neo-nazis and the rich. "
'We should always take Trump’s behavior as a whole. Let’s not forget his past rationale as to why a person with authority is biased against him \n\n- Judge was Hispanic therefore could not render a impartial judgement on Trump cases\n\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/thehill.com/latino/329613-trump-university-judge-on-deported-dreamer-case-report%3Famp\n\nNow: \n\n- FBI investigation on him is biased because Mueller left Trump’s property over dispute on fees ( this is kind of laughable because didn’t Trump say that his continued involvement in his business would not cause any conflict of interest, apparently not, but only in his favor *rolleyes why don’t you divest then you dingbat) \n\n- Mueller worked for a law firm that represented Kushner? (Huh? How is this a disqualifying factor) \n\n- Mueller was interviewed for the position of FBI director? (Again, wtf) \n\n- An FBI agent attended a Hillary Clinton Event so now he’s an agent of Hillary because that’s how things work in Trump’s Head, kind of like, if you were ever at a Trump rally then you’re forever for Trump and his policies. \n\nHave you ever attended a Trump rally? \nOh no now you have Trump stamp \n\n\n\n'

"Yglesias' points are all well taken. The system of government described in the memo would clearly not be what the founding fathers intended, and it would be unconstitutional, given that the President is instructed in the constitution to 'faithfully execute the laws'. However, what's lacking in the essay is a description of how the other branches of government can effectively check a President who believes such an exercise of the office is permitted. Impeachment is not a remedy (how to argue that a exercise of executive decisions is unconstitutional or unlawful when the decisions are within the purview of unitary executive discretion).  \n\nWhat is the actual mechanism of enforcement if the 'independence' of the Justice Department is only an illusion, a 'norm'. It may be that there are real constitutional problems with the idea of trying to fix the practical mechanism by statute. However, because the judicial branch oversees the integrity of the courts, and prosecutorial behavior is a matter of appeal, I would think that the Supreme Court would have the final say and can impose a remedy. It seems like there needs to be specific details developed to formalize a remedy in the practical day-to-day sense because norms just aren't going to cut it anymore. On the other hand, to abandon the spirit of the law because it no longer has any power, and ask for protection from tyranny with just the letter, that's a kind of decay. It won't end well either."

'Whenever I read about the things Trump does, and the reaction from the current Republican party and its followers, I can\'t help but think of a quote from Loki in the Marvel Thor movies:\n\n*"Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It’s the unspoken truth of humanity that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life’s joy in a mad scramble for power. For identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel."*\n\nAs I try to think of something that better encapsulates how I view the modern day Trump supporting Republican, I can\'t think of one that fits it more than this. I know that a lot of people immediately think of some racist, slobbering and raging drunk redneck screaming about kicking anyone who doesn\'t look like them off their soil, but this is what I see more than anything else. \n\nLook at what\'s happening to our government. Our president has filled each department with people who often have only the qualification of being his rich friend, supporter or being related to him. His lawyer has been paid inordinate amounts of money from people who have then later directly benefited from decisions his government has made at the cost of our own personal freedoms. He is single handedly crippling the blue collar job market in the Midwest, on purpose, with tariffs that he and his will reap the rewards of. And he has now stated, unequivocally, that he is beyond reproach and beyond the reach of the law in doing any of this. \n\nOne by one he has taken dumps on every major and respected member of the Republican party, on the NRA, on gun owners, and on blue collar steel/coal/etc workers throughout the country. He has changed the tax laws to specifically reward himself and his friends at the cost of those very same blue collar workers he has just screwed. And every facet of the way that he carries himself in his personal life is a direct affront to the religious right, going down breaking each of the 10 commandments like a checklist.\n\nThis man, on paper, should be the single worst nightmare of the GOP. He would be the very anti-Christ that they accused Obama of being. \n\nSo, how do they react in the fact of their natural enemy? Throughoutall of this, what have the Republicans done? Cheered. *Good for him, taking control of the country! Good for him, stepping on us to better himself and his friends! Who needs due process when it comes to taking guns; why did we ever think that was important? He\'s obviously a godly man despite how he lives his life! Why did we ever support Law enforcement, knowing that one day they might investigate our master?! To hell with the FBI, and it\'s war-hero church attending special counsel! Walk on me more, my lord, and ignore those crybabies who scream about outdated concepts like "freedom".*\n\nI can\'t help but feel like these people WANT to be subjugated. They WANT to kneel. A far cry from the Republican party I grew up with.\n\nI feel like the era of the "Don\'t Tread On Me" conservative has died, and has been replaced with "Step On Me More, Please"'
'Ok.

'**Facts:**\n\nSean Hannity is always among the first in US media to start pushing the newest Kremlin talking points. \n\nSean Hannity hosted exclusive interviews with Assange repeatedly. \n\nJoe Scarborough called him an “apparatchik for Russia”.\n\nEx-CIA Director Michael Hayden had this to say:\n\n> Michael Hayden, who led the CIA under Bush from 2006 to 2009, told Brookings Institution senior fellow Benjamin Wittes in an email sent over the weekend that “Hannity has entered the pantheon of a true propagandist."\n> \n> “And his behavior reminds me of a conversation I had with a political officer in the mid-1980s when I was an air attaché to Bulgaria,” he continued.\n> \n> “I asked this officer what truth was to him,” Hayden said. **“He responded without hesitation, ‘Truth is what serves the party.’ And there you have it.”**\n\nEx-Speaker of the House John Boehner said he was “fucking nuts” after he started going off the deep end.\n\nThere were rumors (unsubstantiated) from a former Secret Service member that Hannity has been in talks with RT. \n\nMurdoch’s news and tabloid outlets in the UK aggressively pushed Brexit, giving Farage and co unprecedented visibility and amplification. \n\n**Conclusion (Speculation):**\n\nSean Hannity is a mercenary propagandist, and Fox was more than happy to give him a platform and reap the benefits. Murdoch’s networks willingly sold their audiences to Russian interests. \n\nMurdoch could be sweating because his networks’ roles in promoting Russian propaganda in the US and UK is teetering ever closer to full exposé. \n\nI’m not sure the probe will reach Murdoch, but I have a strong suspicion Hannity is mana-fucked. I hope Tucker Carlson is roped in as well, he’s been the cleaned up mouthpiece for normalizing white supremacy for months now. '

"As a liberal, I find it sad to see one of the few remaining respectable conservative news publications left in this country fall to shit like this. I depended on the WSJ to provide me with a real and reasonable perspective from across the aisle. I may not agree with most of the ideas and opinions that they presented, but at least I could respect and understand them.\n\nBetween the Times and the Journal, I always felt I had a fairly balanced understanding of American politics. Unfortunately, their descent into pandering, partisan trash had already forced me to reconsider my subscription, which is sad, because there are some great journalists there. \n\nI'm now left with no reliable source of news to inform me on conservative ideals. Who do I turn to? Fox News? If sources like Fox are the true representation of conservatives today, then my understanding of Republicans is truly at it's end. If this is really what the other side of the political spectrum has become, then I don't know what to do. If that is truly who many of my neighbors, friends and colleagues have become, I can't see a path forward for any of us.\n\nThis world grows more depressing every day. Fuck."

So we have one super-rich media owner slogging it against some others, while the poor people are picking which oligarch to support.  The whole situation is a big joke.  There is no winning super-rich.  The whole system is a joke.\n\nThe only winning move here is to oppose the socioeconomic dynamics that lead up to such insane levels of wealth inequality.'

"Ahh yes, today we are made to feel like there could be justice. Tomorrow's news will make us think otherwise.\n\nThis is life now."
"> Gates was “directly communicating in September and October 2016” with an unidentified person who “has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016,” the filing says.\n\n> Crucially, Gates was aware of this person's ties to Russian intelligence, the filing adds, calling the 2016 conversations “pertinent to the investigation.”\n\n"
'I love Court Filings!'
'>Gates last month struck a plea deal with Mueller, likely avoiding decades behind bars. Yet it remains unclear what information the former Trump official offered in return.\n\nThat could be the key variable here: was Mueller fully aware of this contact between Gates and the Russian intermediary before he offered the plea deal? If so, I’m inclined to think that Manafort is not the only high-profile character Gates could conceivably help Mueller take down. If not, Gates will likely find himself in no less trouble than Manafort is now. To accept a generous offer for one’s full cooperation, and then withhold key information, would be near-suicidal. Especially when dealing with someone like Mueller: tough as nails, but pragmatic.\n\nEither way, Gates now looks like a ‘bigger fish’ than initial impressions would suggest.'
"I'm pretty sure we are going to be electing the new president by the time this Russia thing actually gets anywhere. "

'Some highlights:\n\n>Special counsel Robert Mueller’s team **in mid-October** issued a subpoena to President Donald Trump’s campaign **requesting Russia-related documents from more than a dozen top officials**, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\n>**The subpoena, which requested documents and emails from the listed campaign officials that reference a set of Russia-related keywords, marked Mr. Mueller’s first official order for information from the campaign,** according to the person. The subpoena didn’t compel any officials to testify before Mr. Mueller’s grand jury, the person said.\n\n>**The subpoena caught the campaign by surprise,** the person said. The campaign had previously been voluntarily complying with the special counsel’s requests for information, and had been sharing with Mr. Mueller’s team the documents it provided to congressional committees as part of their probes of Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election.\n\n>The Trump campaign is providing documents in response to the subpoena on an “ongoing” basis, the person said.\n\n>**A spokesman for the special counsel declined to comment.**\n\n>Mr. Mueller and congressional committees are investigating whether Trump associates colluded with Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election. Mr. Trump has denied collusion by him or his campaign, and Moscow has denied meddling in the election.\n\n>Separately, the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday said senior White House official Jared Kushner hadn’t turned over all the documents it has requested and asked his lawyer to be more forthcoming.\n\n>Congressional committees earlier this year asked the campaign to turn over Russia-related documents, emails and phone records dating back to June 2015, when Mr. Trump launched his campaign.\n\n>**Sending a subpoena to an entity that says it has been cooperating with document requests isn’t unusual in cases in which prosecutors have some concern that their demands aren’t being met promptly or aren’t being entirely fulfilled,** former prosecutors said. **A subpoena can serve as a backup, to make sure the recipient is complying as promised, and as a reminder that failure to provide documents as demanded would count as obstructing a grand-jury investigation.**\n\n>Mr. Mueller’s team had previously issued subpoenas individually to several top campaign officials, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Mike Flynn. Mr. Manafort currently faces charges including money laundering and tax evasion. He has pleaded not guilty and his attorney has called the charges “ridiculous.”\n\n>The campaign has retained Jones Day—a law firm it paid nearly $3 million during the 2016 campaign for routine legal services—to represent it in the Russia probe and help with document production, according to Federal Election Commission filings.\n\n>Mr. Mueller’s team is expected to interview current and former White House officials, including communications director Hope Hicks, in the coming weeks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The team has interviewed several officials who worked with the campaign, including Reince Priebus and Sean Spicer, who went on to serve as White House chief of staff and press secretary, respectively. They have since left the administration.\n\n>**Congressional investigators, meanwhile, have expressed dissatisfaction with the document productions from top Trump officials, including Mr. Kushner,** the president’s son-in-law and former campaign aide who now serves as a senior White House adviser.\n\n>On Thursday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.), the top Democrat on the committee, said in a letter to Mr. Kushner’s attorney that the response they received to an earlier request was “incomplete.”\n\n>In their letter, the senators mentioned a document that Mr. Kushner had forwarded involving “a Russian backdoor overture and dinner invite.”  The letter doesn’t give other details about the material. A Judiciary Committee spokesman didn’t immediately respond to questions about the document.\n\n>The senators addressed the three-page letter to Mr. Kushner’s attorney, Abbe Lowell. In a statement after the letter was made public, Mr. Lowell said Mr. Kushner had been “responsive to all requests” and had provided documents related to “Mr. Kushner’s calls, contacts or meetings with Russians during the campaign and transition, which was the request.”\n\n>**More to come**\n\nEDIT: Formatting'

'Posted this in a lower thread, but adding to the top.\n\nYesterday Trump started floating the idea of "Even if there was collusion, it\'s ok because it saved us from Hillary". Look for that to get louder as the investigation progresses:\n\n>REPORTER: How do you define collusion? Maggie asked this earlier during the briefing to Sarah —\n>TRUMP: You\'re going to define it for me, OK? But I can tell you, there\'s no collusion. I couldn\'t have cared less about Russians having to do with my campaign. The fact is — you people won\'t say this, but I\'ll say it: I was a much better candidate than her. You always say she was a bad candidate. You never say I was a good candidate. **I was one of the greatest candidates. Nobody else would have beaten the Clinton machine, as crooked as it was.** But I was a great candidate. Someday you\'re going to say that.

"I would be ecstatic if the hammer falls soon (weeks/months). But I really hope Mueller has an airtight case on the players in the Trump adminstration and in the GOP.  I don't want any of these curs slithering away unfazed."

"I really feel that whomever gets indicted next will tell us a lot about the level of corruption and who's involved.  The Papa indictment was certainly a surprise but it really doesn't tell us too much.  The others were no surprise at all.  I think that when the next indictment(s) hit, that will be the blockbuster.

"What I'm personally curious about is not just if Mueller's investigation unveils acts of collusion, but also begins to unravel a huge network of financial corruption.\n\nKind of like how the Panama Papers affected global politics."
'It could be full circle type of event. Imagine if they schedule this on February 14. That’s one year after Trump forced Comey to spend time with him to get a loyalty pledge.

He was my Logistics Manager and an ex-field agent in the FBI so I wonder if his loyalty to the intelligence agency is stronger than his support for Trump. I hope that all of these attacks on the FBI opened his eyes to how terrible his choice was in choosing to support Trump. '

"I voted for Trump. I know, I know- that's not the smartest thing to say here. But it's relevant. \n\nI welcome this. I welcome the investigation; I welcome the cooperation; I welcome the special counsel. I the president of the United States, whoever that may be at any given time, did something illegal or against the best interests of the country, I want to know about it. I want us *all* to know about it. And I want him (or her, depending) out of office. \n\nCurrently, there's some smoke. It certainly makes me curious. I actually trust the process, given the amount of oversight from both parties, so I don't think that evidence will be manufactured or successfully hidden- if nothing else, not from the special counsel's office. When the investigation is complete, I'll look forward to the facts. If I was wrong to vote for him, I'll happily admit that. \n\nSo bring it on. Let's find out what happened and bring it all to light. We, the people, deserve it. "

"This tells me something very important: They want Gates to testify against Trump.  I think it is very, very clear they have quite enough to easily put both Gates and Manafort away for life.

"If it was actually feasible, I'd love to buy Mueller a steak dinner.  Medium rare, of course, not like the treasonous well-done version."
"I truly feel we're one absolutely bombshell news story away from Trump actually doing it.  The walls are closing in on him and his family based on what we've learned about Mueller following the money, top campaign members flipped and are cooperating, Bannon is likely a scorned lover at this point now that he's been made a pariah, god knows what the IC discovered already during the surveillance operation during the campaign, etc.  However this investigation ends, it won't be pretty.  Trump is all about self-preservation and when it's clear where the special consul investigation has lead, he will undoubtedly do something really stupid to stop it."
'Obstruction of justice on an investigation looking into obstruction of justice among other things.\n\nThis stable genius donnie is something else..'

"This is an opinion piece.\n\nA very well written opinion piece, but an opinion piece nonetheless.\n\nI must admit that I am getting very disappointed in this sub, as it seems to endorse one sided articles and really likes making opinion pieces seem like huge deals.  The more shareblue and opinion pieces I see here, the more it is looking like an anti-Trump echo chamber.  Too bad - there's a lot of good data buried deep in the sub, but sorting through the chaff is getting more difficult than ever."
'Maybe some of those Second Amendment folks will help take care of it.'
'FTA: "None of those issues compromised Mueller in any meaningful way. Trump must have known this, of course. But the president, a survivor to his core, had to find some novel way of explaining why he was trying to escape the clutches of an obstruction of justice investigation by obstructing justice.\xa0"\n\nThis is a dangerous way of thinking these days. We\'re still giving Trump way too much credit. When will we start to realize (or at least pontificate) the very real chance that Trump is nothing more than a buffoon and grifter who faked his way to the top?\n\nIf Schumer\'s account of last week\'s budget meeting and the hold that Trump\'s aides had on him we\'re accurate, we need to stop with the narrative that Trump is being clever, or cagey, or has any idea at all of what he\'s doing.\n\n'
'>Although there\'s some debate among legal scholars about how much latitude the president would have for such a purge, Trump\'s previous maneuvering in this investigation suggests he believes he can do almost whatever he wants. \n\nTo me this is the defining Trump mentality, "I can do whatever I want, whenever I want, however I want because what is good for me is good for America." \n\nAnd coupled with his win at any and all costs just underscores his thinking that he doesn\'t see The American Presidency as an elected office but rather, "I won it, it\'s mine, so I get to do whatever I want, however I want, whenever I want; Get over it."\n\nAnd the unfortunate reality for all of us is that aforementioned view of the Presidency is seemingly held a by a very significant amount of Americans who often treat the Presidency as if it is a divine appointment, and anyone who doesn\'t fit their profile is a usurper of all that is Republicany goodness.\n\nWe all need to change our mentality about the Presidency...it is one leg of a three legged government stool...it\'s not the center-pole bar stool of which all that is America rests or falls...\n\nAnd...I am concerned that a lot of Republican voters see the Presidency as a throne put there by the will of God, and suitable only for those whom God wills it to (also, be determined by the chosen few aka conservative Christians)...and that thinking needs to be unlearned.\n\n'
'I kinda feel like Muellers waiting for it. It would only help an obstruction case.'
'>But the president, a survivor to his core, had to find some novel way of explaining why he was trying to escape the clutches of an obstruction of justice investigation by obstructing justice.\n\nWell put.'
'Let\'s not get ahead of ourselves, Trump may or may not try to fire Mueller again. I think it\'s too presumptive to say he "will" try again. However, I think it is important to consider what we as US citizens should do if he does in fact fire him. Like the top comment in this post states, we need to go to the streets and demand his removal. '
"From the article:\n\n>If McGahn is now in Mueller's crosshairs, he might have decided that the simplest solution is to cooperate with the probe and turn over information in exchange for gentler treatment.\n\nWouldn't he have to resign from his position to cooperate? Seems like it would be a conflict of interest and/or violate attorney/client privilege otherwise. IANAL, though, so maybe someone could confirm...\n\nIf that's the case, since he hasn't resigned yet, I'd assume he's not currently cooperating in the manner that type article suggests"
'That\'s not how to get Trump to do what you want.  \n\nHere, try this:\n\nCompare: "Obama would never be brave enough to interview with Mueller"\n\nFlatter: "Trump is so strong and clearly did nothing wrong, if he let Mueller finish his job he would be adored by all Americans"\n\nDistract: "We\'re going to bring those big truck back to the while house lawn"\n\nIt would help immensely if it were Fox news saying any of these.'
'The founding fathers foresaw a Trump but what they did not imagine is that the majority party would be unwilling to do their jobs and protect our institutions from a demagogue. Our system is built on the trust in our legislative branch to do their jobs and check the executive but Republicans have failed us all. '
"The electoral college was supposed to prevent this bloated asshole from even getting into office but yet here we are.  We can't rely on dead men that lived in the 1700's to handle our issues in the 2000's.  "
"Much as I love dunkin' on Trump, I hate our deification of the founders. Yeah they almost certainly were smarter than this buffoon, but that's a pretty low bar and they didn't know everything. Talking heads reference them like some sort of hyper advance ancient alien species."
'To be fair, everyone is smarter than he is.'
"I don't know if they planned for the complete... failure, abdication, corruption?... of one of two major political parties.  Our institutions only work if they're operated in good faith, and the Republican party has proven its willingness to operate in bad faith to see its goals carried out.  And unfortunately the only reason the Republican party has for existing is to hurt brown people, poor people, gay people, and women, while concentrating more and more wealth in the hands of a few primarily old white men.  I hope that our republic can survive it."
"I'll agree that they planned for a president to go off the rails, however they didn't plan on partisan politics allowing the legislative branch to be completely in line with it. If we make it out of this alive, I would hope the blue tidal wave in 2018 and 2020 passes legislation about pardoning powers of presidents whose staff is being investigated"
'> “One might ask, if this is all a big witch hunt and Mr. Trump has nothing illegal or untoward to hide, why does he care about the privilege in the first place?” the editorial board wrote. “The answer, of course, is that he has a lot to hide.”\n\nThe above is from NYT Editorial Board. Honestly, why does Trump keeps crowing about this if this is something about a nothing burger. That reminds me of his oft repeated comment from campaign - "Only guilty take the 5th". He should shut up and work on what he has been elected for rather than watching TV and tweeting endlessly.'
"That's damning the founders with faint praise. There are squirrels more intelligent than Trump."
"Beautiful sentiment but it has a major flaw: While our Constitution may be filled with checks and balances to limit the power of a president, those machinations are constituted entirely of people. If those people abdicate their role in limiting the president, then there's not much limit to what he can do. \n\nOur forefathers may have planned for a Donald Trump, but they didn't plan for a spinless and sycophantic Congress divided by tribalism and committed to nothing other than their team winning so that their re-election campagins could be properly funded. They didn't plan on what is essentially State Media hammering the president's message into the public over and over again with exaggerations, half-truths, and outright lies in order to galvanize large swaths of the country in their support of an autocrat.\n\nOur Constitution isn't worth the paper it's printed on without leaders in place who are prepared to uphold it."
'I love the quote "America is stronger than you because our forefathers were smarter than you and they planned for you". It summarizes exactly the essence of what makes this country so great.'
'I think this is a positive way to reach trumps base. “You guys love America right? And you love the forefathers?” \n“Duh”\n“Well did you know they were trying to prevent a future tyrant like trump from overthrowing their government with these laws that he is breaking?” (List all the laws trump is breaking and considering breaking)\n\nYou have to get very simple with it. Like talking to a child. Then go back and explain why breaking these laws could destroy the country they love. '
"I wish I believed that the Republicans would impeach him if he did that, but they won't.  They've shown time and time again they value: campagn donors, party, country, in that order."
'well, that’s pretty much gonna guarantee he tries to fire him. can’t stand having his big beautiful stable genius brain insulted.'
"The forefathers did not anticipate having a rule that you can't just make your resort and high rise hotel your White House and charge the secret service lots of money to protect you.\n\nTrump is obviously smarter and found all the best loopholes. He also takes his morning constitutionals in the Rose Garden and it's rumored the plants are loving it. The best fertilizer.\n\nCheckmate founding fathers."
"Sounds like he's daring that fat orange llama to do it..."
'Donald is going to make us love America again by proving how amazing the government works when qualified people (like Mueller) are doing their jobs.'
'That is a wise comment. The founding fathers were pretty darn smart. '
"This forefather worship always gets a chuckled out of me. Modern US politics upholds the constitution as a sacred, immutable text but also a living, breathing one. I'm pretty sure a lot of these amendments are being misrepresented, and the forefathers lived in a completely different world where a lot of modern issues were simply unpredicatable. The US political system is barely working right now, so this talk about planning for contingencies like this is just lip service. Trump has already done a substantial amount of things that no other POTUS would have done before for fear of reprisal and legal consequences."
'That doesn’t sound like an ethical thing to say for an ethics chief'
'Not only were our forefathers smarter than him, my daughter is smarter than him.\n\nMy daughter will be three weeks old on Sunday.'
'They were great people. They are why we shouldn’t repeal the 2A either. '
'Jeez, I wish I was as confident as this guy.'
'>Thursday afternoon, the president tweeted a message that took a more subdued tone than that of his cable news spinning allies: "I have agreed with the historically cooperative, disciplined approach that we have engaged in with Robert Mueller (Unlike the Clintons!). I have full confidence in Ty Cobb, my Special Counsel, and have been fully advised throughout each phase of this process."\n\nThis well written text was obviously provided by someone to Trump.  He then added that idiotic parenthetical about the Clintons.    His handlers must just cringe when he does this. '
'Yet more obstruction of justice rofl'
'These are definitely the actions of an innocent man.\n\n/s'
'I guess the comforting thing here is that all these WH insiders who constantly leak things like this to the press are probably also completely fine cooperating with Mueller and giving him way more information than we see.'
"The idea that your actions are justified legally because some punndit approves of them is ridiculous and certainly wouldn't hold up in court"
'At this point if he does fire Mueller, I really this country revolts and overthrows him the old school way. What a message that would send to leaders here and around the world. It would probably inspire more people to rise up and smack down their oppressive regimes. I get that a lot of people will do nothing, but if we have hundreds of thousands marching on DC, which is what I hope it would and not just some bullshit "chant slogans and complain while not really doing anything" protest like they usually are, then we could really change things. If this happens, its not a "spreading awareness" moment. Its a surround the WH and don\'t even let Trump walk outside moment. I hope people understand that. '
'Bold strategy. This is basically the definition of obstruction of justice. '
'Interesting.\n\nNixon didn\'t have the right-wing propaganda machine that is Fox "News" back when he did this. I bet he would have survived if he did, if he was able to manipulate it like Trump is attempting to do here.\n\nHonestly we are at a point where the people that think this is OK -- that he should be able to fire all these people -- those people that believe that shouldn\'t be allowed within 100 yards of any building political building. They should not be included anymore.'

'I\'ve talked myself back around to "Person A" being Manafort.  This is complicated and relates to work by Manafort to defend Ukraine\'s prosecution of Yulia Tymoshenko.  One aspect of the campaign Manafort devised was to retain the prestigious law firm Skadden Arps to prepare a report on the proceedings.  \n\n> Skadden was hired by the Ukraine’s Ministry of Justice as an independent consultant to write a report about whether the prosecution, trial and conviction of Yulia Tymoshenko — the former prime minister and an opponent of ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych — applied Western standards of due process. The firm publicly issued the report in December 2012, concluding that under Western standards, she was denied basic rights such as the right to counsel; that she was improperly incarcerated during trial; and that she would have received a new trial in the West.\n\n[Source.](https://www.law360.com/articles/514057/skadden-s-ukraine-prosecution-report-unlikely-to-harm-firm)  (Paywalled, but I will paste it here if people are interested.)\n\nLater, papers related to the report were recovered with a cache of other documents left behind as members of the former Ukrainian government fled.

'Earlier this week, [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/04/politics/mueller-special-counsel-investigation-russian-oligarchs/index.html) broke the story that Mueller had stopped several oligarchs asking questions about Russian money being funneled to the campaign or inauguration. That story indicates that Mueller and his team were focused on two methods to accomplish this:\n\n1. One area under scrutiny, sources say, is investments Russians made in companies or think tanks that have political action committees that donated to the campaign.\n\n2. Another theory Mueller\'s office is pursuing, sources said, is whether wealthy Russians used straw donors -- Americans with citizenship -- as a vessel through which they could pump money into the campaign and inauguration fund.\n\nPrevious stories from the Dallas Morning News have also raised questions about straw donors. One of these stories, ["How Putin\'s oligarchs funneled millions into GOP campaigns"](https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2017/12/15/putins-proxies-helped-funnel-millions-gop-campaigns), focused on several specific people:\n\n* Len Blavatnik, a dual U.S.-U.K. citizen and one of the largest donors to GOP political action committees in the 2015-16 election cycle. [...] Data from the Federal Election Commission show that Blavatnik\'s campaign contributions dating back to 2009-10 were fairly balanced across party lines and relatively modest for a billionaire. [...] In 2015-16, everything changed. Blavatnik\'s political contributions soared and made a hard right turn as he pumped $6.35 million into GOP political action committees, with millions of dollars going to top Republican leaders including Sens. Mitch McConnell, Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham.\n\n* Andrew Intrater, according to Mother Jones, is Vekselberg\'s cousin. He is also chief executive of Columbus Nova, Renova\'s U.S. investment arm located in New York. (FEC records list his employer as Renova US Management LLC.). Intrater had no significant history of political contributions prior to the 2016 elections. But in January 2017 he contributed $250,000 to Trump\'s Inaugural Committee. His six-figure gift bought him special access to a dinner billed as "an intimate policy discussion with select cabinet appointees," according to a brochure obtained by the Center for Public Integrity.\n\n* Alexander Shustorovich, chief executive of IMG Artists, attempted to give the Republican Party $250,000 in 2000 to support the George W. Bush presidential campaign, but his money was rejected because of his ties to the Russian government, according to Quartz. So why didn\'t the Trump team reject Shustorovich\'s $1 million check to Trump\'s Inaugural Committee?\n\n* Simon Kukes is an oil magnate who has something in common with Intrater. From 1998 to 2003, he worked for Vekselberg and Blavatnik as chief executive of TNK. Redacted CIA documents released in 2003 under the Freedom of Information Act said "TNK president Kukes said that he bribed local officials." The CIA confirmed the authenticity of the reports to The Guardian newspaper but would not comment further. In 2016, Kukes contributed a total of $283,000, much of it to the Trump Victory Fund. He had no significant donor history before last year\'s election.\n\nAnother name worth looking at is Timothy Kasbe, who was discussed in the Washington Post\'s story about [well-connected Russians who attended the Trump inauguration](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/amid-trumps-inaugural-festivities-members-of-russias-elite-anticipated-a-thaw-between-moscow-and-washington/2018/01/20/0d767f46-fb9f-11e7-ad8c-ecbb62019393_story.html?utm_term=.c352bf8495d1).\n\nPrior to donating $150,000.00 to the Trump inauguration, Kasbe had no prior history of political contributions/donations. Kasbe was also an executive at a Russian-based jean company at the time he made the donation. Kasbe then left the country to take a job in New Zealand shortly after the inauguration.\n\nWhy was he covered in the WaPo story? It\'s because he was the one who invited Alexey Repik, one of the wealthy Russians with rumored ties to the FSB who attended the inauguration. Kasbe told the WaPo that the Repiks were "family friends from California," while Repik said "they had met months earlier during a tour of Silicon Valley companies for Russian business executives that Kasbe helped host on behalf of a headhunting firm."\n\nRepik had access to some major players during his inauguration visit. He attended various events where he met President Trump, Mike Pence, Reince Priebus, Rex Tillerson, and Mike Pompeo, posting some of these encounters on a public Facebook post and discussing others with the WaPo. \n\nHow did Repik get access to these power players? Well, Kasbe\'s [inauguration donation](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/donald-trump-cabinet-dinner-233721) would have provided some access. However, it appears Kasbe told the [New Zealand Herald](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11981768) that the event where Repik met President Trump was unrelated to his inauguration tickets/donations.\n\nWho invited Repik to that event? According to Repik\'s own [Facebook post](https://i.imgur.com/5LdPitV.png), it was **Reince Priebus.**'

'From someone on /r/ALL, you’re all starting to sound like conspiracy theorists.

'> “Trump finally broke that embargo by agreeing to provide thirty-five Javelin anti-tank launchers—fewer than the number in one US infantry battalion,” he said.\n\nAs a former Javelin Gunner USMC from 2002 - 2006 I have some questions about those numbers. \n\nIs it 35 launchers (CLU) or 35 missiles? If it’s missiles then that is a major deterrent to a tank threat. If it is CLUs then that is astounding. \n\nEach CLU can launch unlimited missiles and during my service was estimated to cost +$400K. And we only had **3-4 per Battalion** not 35. These are deadly effective and 4 Javelin teams composed only of freshly trained recruits would be an awesome sight. But 35 Jav teams? That would be massive overkill. \n\nAs a side note, during my service our Regimental Commander was Col. Joseph Dunford. He had a strange fascination with the Javelin and would sometimes just “hang out” with our platoon. Now, he is Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I wonder how much influence he had on this decision. '
'So let me get this straight.

'The right does not own patriotism. Definitely not now.\n\n\nEdit: thanks for the gold! '
"You know its bad when: Fox News reports that the Democrats erupt into cheering *'USA! USA! USA!'* on the House floor following a speech from their whip about how Putin and Russia are jeopardizing the security of elections, including text that explicitly states that the Republicans did not join in the chant. \n\nThat is when you know. its. bad. "
">Democrats then began chanting. Republicans didn’t join in.\n\nConfirmed.  Republicans are Anti-USA.  Unless it's other American members of our society protesting injustice, who just happen to not be white."
'I feel dirty because ‘Fox’ but it was too damn patriotic not to post.'
'Holy shit. I didn\'t think any Democrat actually had energy! I looked up more of Steny Hoyer on C-Span from earlier today, and I\'m pumped! He\'s tired and angry of the partisan politics being played out on issues that should easily stretch across the aisle. I like this man.\n\n[Link](https://www.c-span.org/video/?448486-1/us-house-meets-legislative-business&vod)\n\nI highly recommend clicking "View from beginning", and clicking foward to 2:41:00. You\'ll have to stomach 3:30 of Kevin McCarthy speaking to get context, but GODDAM is it worth it!'
'Honestly, I would love to see more of this.  I\'ve never been a flag-waving, U-S-A chanting zealot, but sometimes it feels right.  Trouble is, Democrats have completely ceded that space to conservative, pretend patriots, to the point where I assume a flag in front of a house or on a bumper means "gun-toting Trump supporter."\n\nLet\'s reclaim patriotism for the real patriots!  U-S-A!  U-S-A!'
'They gave him five minutes and cut him after 1 min. Fuck. Every. Single. Republican. Traitor. '
'Wow. \n\nRepublicans blast citizens for taking a knee during the national anthem as un-patriotic. They claim they are there to do a job and shouldn’t push their agenda. \n\nSame ones sitting on their fat hypocritical asses during chants of USA as Patriots hope to defend us against an ongoing attack from Russia. \n\nYou are all compromised. Fuck all of you hypocritical Republicans. '
'Patriotism on the right has always been fake. For fuck sakes, conservatives who live in northern states, including a [sitting fucking congressman](https://www.omaha.com/news/politics/rep-steve-king-draws-criticism-for-having-confederate-flag-on/article_7d870961-c77e-5870-a150-268e538e2e8e.html), proudly flies the treasonous flag of an army that killed hundreds of thousands of US servicemen.\n\nI live in northern Ohio, literally on the fucking Canadian border, and I see that traitorous flag up here all the time, under the guise of "heritage".\n\nFuck the right and their fake patriotism. Democrats have always been the real patriots. We use our patriotism as a tool to make America better, while conservatives use it as a weapon to silence dissent.'
"Fire any son of a bitch that won't stand for the US!"
"But how? I thought the Dems hated our country?  /s  Look at the turmoil going on in some of them.  Should I stand? Am I allowed to stand? What happens if I stand? I'll just sit here like family."
"It's clear as day now that the GOP are traitors.\n\nIf we have to have a 2nd Civil War then so be it.\n\nFuck these corrupt, evil morons!"
"and why didn't republicans join in?\n\nbecause they seek to harm America. \n\nfuck you republicans. fuck you trump supporters. "
'I can\'t believe that the GOP is so fucking stupid they managed to let the Dems wrest the "Patriotic" label from them.'
"That's how you do It! Take back the symbols that have been stolen by the fake patriots.\n\n\nI don't give a damn if you're a hardcore anarchist who thinks the American flag is the ultimate symbol of evil, fly one at a protest anyways. Police beating and gassing crowds of people flying flags would be really bad optics for the right.\n\n\nFly an upside-down flag, which is recognized as a distress signal."
'Conservative logic: When it’s republicans it’s patriotism but when it’s democrats it’s evil nationalism '
'Fuck Trump. Fuck Putin. Fuck the GOP.\n\nVote American, Vote Democrat.'
'The GOP, as a collective, have lost whatever brain cells they had left. After close to 2 years of denying the hacking by foreign govts (be it Russia, China, North Korea, etc..) how can you even justify this move to cut election security funding. I just found out last night thanks to Rachel Maddow that the great orange imbecile, as his first directive, fired the head of CyberSecurity for the US government. Seriously???? Wake the F UP Americans, your country is dying.'
'So it\'s considered cringey to chant USA according to the same right wing trolls that casually refer to twomp as their "god emperor"? It\'s not even funny at this point. It\'s sad and scary to see such ignorance on the loose. I can\'t wait for elections. '
'I hope this sends a message to our foreign leaders that not all of Congress is brain dead, and are willing to fight for what is right.'
"More of this shit. More, more, more.\n\nDemocrats need to chant and shout for our country over and over again. Republicans *do not have a leg to stand on here*. Our country is being fucking attacked. I remember the last time that happened 17 years ago. We all waved our flags, chanted USA! USA! and got tears in our eyes at the National Anthem. People are angry at Trump for a million reasons, but this ought to be the thing that pisses us *all* off. Get angry and get patriotic, and let's fight for our country."
'Call me crazy but this is a hell of a coincidence.  Remember Trump saying, ["Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing"](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html)?  That was July 27, 2016.\n\nNow look at this line on pages 7-8 of the indictment:\n\n> For example, on or about **July 27, 2016**, the Conspirators attempted after hours to spearphish **for the first time** email accounts at a domain hosted by a third-party provider and used by Clinton\'s personal office.  At or around the same time, they also targeted seventy-six email addresses at the domain for the Clinton Campaign.\n\n*edit: belated typo fix*'
'Here\'s a buried lede in the indictments:  \n  \n[Link](https://twitter.com/peterjhasson/status/1017805935400706052):  \n  \n>On or about August 15, 2016, the Conspirators, posing as Guccifer 2.0, received a request for stolen documents from a candidate for the US Congress. The Conspirators responded using the Guccifer 2.0 persona and sent the candidate stolen documents related to the candidate\'s opponent.  \n  \nThere\'s your fucking collusion.  \n  \nedit: My guess is [Matt Gaetz](https://mobile.twitter.com/RVAwonk/status/1017539605132906497), the most vocal in calling for Trump to fire Mueller. Gaetz is also buddy-buddy with Roger Stone.  \n  \nedit 2: Appears Ron DeSantis used some as well, see comment from user aafarensis with the link. Also, [this WSJ story from 2017:](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-alleged-russian-hacker-teamed-up-with-florida-gop-operative-1495724787) "How Alleged Russian Hacker Teamed Up With Florida GOP Operative"  \n  \n>The hacking spree that upended the presidential election wasn’t limited to Democratic National Committee memos and Clinton-aide emails posted on websites. The hacker also privately sent Democratic voter-turnout analyses to a Republican political operative in Florida named Aaron Nevins.  \n  \nSo connecting dots here: Guccifer (Russians) hack DCCC/DNC info in Florida. Roger Stone acts as POC for Guccifer, and has them give the info to Nevins. Nevins then distributes the hacked documents to DeSantis and Gaetz. My guess is that Gaetz is the one mentioned in the indictment given it says "candidate" not "incumbent" or "sitting Congressman".'
"Few quick notes : \n\n[Here's the actual indictment](https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download)\n\n\n* Guccifer 2.0/DCleaks (which Roger Stone and Wikileaks were in communication with. )\n\n* It confirms the effort (and those aliases) were directly tied to GRU and the Russian government.\n\n* The indictments mention Wikileaks as an unnamed group(not yet indicted) used for timing and distribution of the hacked information for maximum effect \n\n* The indictments mention communications with Stone as an unnamed person (not yet indicted) whom provided extensive feedback on the hacked materials. \n\n* The indictments mention distribution of hacked material to an unnamed state lobbyist/online source of political news (not sure who this is yet, might be [this guy](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-alleged-russian-hacker-teamed-up-with-florida-gop-operative-1495724787), but I'm not sure)\n\n* The indictment mentions an unnamed Congressional candidate who had sought and received material. (not sure who this is yet)  [People seem to think this is Brian Mast,](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/gop-operative-russian-hacker-gave-him-2016-voter-data) we'll see if that gets confirmed. Nevins may have assisted all Florida GOP members, its possible someone outside of Florida directly asked themselves. \n\n\n* The indictment mentions GRU working with journalist looking for dirt on Black Lives Matter. (Someone from Breitbart?, Fox? some obvious suspects there) This appears to be Breitbart/Sputnik journalist Lee Stranahan. \n\n\n\n* **The indictment mentions targeted attacks on July 27, 2016 directed at the Clinton campaign and Clinton's personal office. What else happened that day? [Trump publicly asked Russia to hack Clinton](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/trump-putin-no-relationship-226282) .** Fun coincidence huh? \n\n* The indictment, much like the last one of the Russians doesn't try to assess whether or not they had an impact on the election results. It is a specific, isolated slice as it has been every time. \n\n\n* This now means Mueller has charged 32 people 3 companies and has gotten 5 guilty pleas in a little over a year. Involving both Trump officials (whom were all charged with crimes in one way or another related to Russia) or people tied to the Russian government. \n\nThis witch hunt is finding an awful lot of witches.\n\nThis comes off the back of a joke of a hearing yesterday where the House GOP attacked and tried to discredit one of the lead FBI agents on the FBI investigation into this and also Trump meets with Putin in a few days. Quite the contrast.\n\n\nI'll edit this if I think of anything else of note/see anyone else notice anything. And if people have questions, feel free to ask. \n"
'Guys, check out bullet point 43: https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download\n\n"On or about August 15, 2016, the Conspirators, posing as Guccifer 2.0, received a request for stolen documents from a candidate for the US Congress. The Conspirators responded using the Guccifer 2.0 persona and sent the candidate stolen documents related to the candidate\'s opponent."\n\nTHAT\'S COLLUSION. Cut and dry.'
'Watch live:\n\nhttps://www.c-span.org/video/?448407-1/deputy-attorney-general-rosenstein-holds-news-conference\n\nEDIT: Presser now over, indictment documents online here:\n\nhttps://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download \n\nHoly shit, two of the 12 were trying to hack _actual voting machines_. This is huge.\n\n"Russia, if you\'re listening..."\n\nApparently, they very much were.\n\nEDIT: Wikileaks also clearly involved as a puppet of the GRU, although Rosenstein is not identifying them by name - merely refers to "another group" that was funnelled DNC documents to be released to the public.\n\nEDIT: Just so there\'s no misunderstanding: the GRU is an official intelligence organ of the Russian government. This was a state-sponsored attack on the electoral system of the United States. The timing of this - two days before Trump has a private meeting with Putin - cannot be an accident. Were I a total conspiracy theorist, I would wonder if the DoJ is setting a trap for their own President...\n\nEDIT: Trump was informed earlier in the week and is fully aware of the indictments being made today despite being overseas.\n\nEDIT: In Q&A, Rosenstein makes it clear that the timing of these indictments relative to Trump\'s meeting with Putin is coincidental. Conspiracy theorists, stand down :)\n\nEDIT: In Q&A, Rosenstein declines to speculate as to whether GRU attempts to influence the election were actually _successful_ - these indictments merely allege that they _attempted_ it.\n\nEDIT: In Q&A, Rosenstein elegantly side-steps a question as to whether Trump approved of the indictments :) \n\n"I\'ll let the President speak for himself" lol\n\nLet me guess, it\'s still a witch-hunt, amirite? :)\n\nEDIT: Oh my god, he actually did call it a witch-hunt again. Earlier today at Chequers (remember, he knew about these indictments in advance). Unbelievable.\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/hours-after-bashing-british-leader-may-trump-praises-her-n891131\n\n> He also said the investigation into his 2016 campaign\'s ties to Russia is harmful to the U.S., particularly as he aims to form a better relationship with President Vladimir Putin when the two meet in Helsinki Monday.\n\n> "I think that we\'re being hurt very badly by the — I would call it \'the witch hunt.\' I would call it \'the rigged witch hunt,\'" he said of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\'s probe. "I think that really hurts our country and it really hurts our relationship with Russia. I think that we would have a chance to have a very good relationship with Russia."\n\n> Trump said "yes" when asked whether he would tell Putin not to meddle in American elections ...'
'Rosenstein: "I briefed President Trump earlier this week."\n\nTrump this AM: "The DOJ investigation is a witchhunt!"\n\nRosenstein: "The Russians are attacking us."\n\nTrump: "The DOJ is attacking us!" '
'Fox just cut off a congressman who said this made Trump look guilty. \n\nNow they are covering Lisa Page and starting the fire Rosenstien dogwistles'
"Someday when this is a film, this scene will be intercut with Trump sitting down to tea with the Queen.  As he raises the teacup to his gross lips, the scene will cut to Rod Rosenstein announcing the indictment of twelve Russian spies. Then it will cut back to Trump and he'll make a gross slurping noise."
" He's walking out now on cspan\n\nhttps://www.c-span.org/video/?448407-1/deputy-attorney-general-rosenstein-holds-news-conference\n\nThe hacks were by GRU and targeted Clinton, DNC, state boards of elections, and voting software companies.\n\nEdit:\n\nPretty sure they just implicated WikiLeaks but didnt name them.\n\nEdit: \n\nAnd cryptocurrency funded a lot of it, those are probably going to nosedive.\n\nIf they're tracing GRU crypto spending, it's really likely they've seen all the payments coming from those accounts.\n\nEdit:\n\nDirect shots fired at trump for constantly lying to the media, I think the way Stzork was treated finally pissed off the FBI.\n\nEdit:\n\nHe said the fact that this is happening the day before trump and putin's date is coincidence.\n\nEdit:\n\nJust said that there are other agencies that have been investigating this since before the FBI was looking at it, and those investigations might still be ongoing when the FBI is done. \n\nThat sounds like CIA that was already watching Russia and saw it from that end as well.\n\n\n**Last Edit:**\n\nYou can use NPR's timeline to compare to the indictment to figure out who was who in some cases.\n\n[Timeline](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/31/537926933/2016-under-scrutiny-a-timeline-of-russia-connections)\n\n[Indictment](https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download)"
'Please humor me in engaging in a tactic called *reflection*. We know there are Russian agents on here, usually low level Russians needing cash (what with the economic depression and sanctions, Russia isn\'t doing so hot), so here\'s how you get through to them:\n\nWhenever you suspect they may be from Russia, insert some information that Russian citizens don\'t normally see. Use it as a backdoor *back into* Russia. Eventually the higher-ups won\'t like what their workers see. Eventually, it might start swaying Russians.\n\nRemember, don\'t take fault in the Russian citizens—I personally admire them and their stoicism—strictly recognize the state actors who manipulate them. \n\nSo with that, let\'s talk about Russia, the Oligarchy, and Putin:\n\nIt really is par for the course for Putin. A consistently predictable pattern of corruption. Coincidence and controversy abounds around this sadistic ego-tripping scapegoating denialist.

'We should be worried about this threat to our entire democracy. Instead, we are arguing amongst each other and playing right into their hands. This is pathetic. Look at what Rosenstein said,\n\n“When we confront foreign interference in American elections, it is important for us to avoid thinking politically as Republicans or Democrats and instead to think patriotically as Americans. Our response must not depend on who was victimized,” he said. “There will always be adversaries who work to exacerbate domestic differences and try to confuse, divide, and conquer us. So long as we are united in our commitment to the values enshrined in the Constitution, they will not succeed.”\n\nAllowing ourselves to further this schism in our country is foolish.'
'"On or about August 15, 2016, the Conspirators, posing as Guccifer 2.0, received a request for stolen documents from a candidate for U.S. Congress. The Conspirators responded using the Guccifer 2.0 person and sent the candidate stolen documents related to the candidate\'s opponent." (Bottom of Pg. 15)\n\nHoly shit'
"Bottom line is I don't care if there was direct collusion. Having this brazen attack on our Democracy happen, and then not doing anything to punish Russia or protect future elections is just as morally bankrupt. "

"Not nearly enough outrage. I recommend sending some angry calls to your reps and say this behavior is unacceptable and you're tired of the token chide Trump then back-to-business-as-usual flow that has been going on. Protests also need to be set up immediately. "
"Impeach him. Call your reps, especially if they're part of this criminal cabal called the GOP."
"I'm not American but I have a question: are you guys just going to wait until Democrats take back the House, the Senate, or is there a movement being organized to protest and kick Trump out? It seems with everything that is going on, things should be moving at a quicker pace and grassroots movements and protests should organize. The most people do seems to be to call their representative, from what I get? What is going on?"
"If I were McFaul, I'd refuse.  I'd rather go to a US jail than allow Putin to get evidence on me that he can use to kill me.  "
'Outrage over something he did/said?! I\'m not even sure that I\'m capable of any level of emotional response toward this man anymore. He is the same creature today that\'s he\'s been his entire life and those of you that voted for him without realizing it are morons. In fact, I actually have less of a problem with the people who voted for him just to say "fuck you" because that surprises me a lot less than the people who thought he was the right choice due to his platform and business "acumen". '
"If this isn't the straw that breaks Fat Joffrey's back, nothing should be.\n\nIt won't be of course, because this ship has sailed.  \n\nThe American system of government, its forms and elections, but especially its electorate and representatives are horribly irrevocably broken."
'We should be outraged that this was even considered. On the plus side, a very big plus at that, is that we have no extradition treaty with Russia and no one can be compelled to act against their will to do anything other than what they will. Trump can eff himself. '

'If this presidency doesn’t end with a Revenge of the Sith style “It’s treason then” moment, I will be severely disappointed.'

'I know I’ve said this before, but it’s always crazy to me as a black woman that America just let foreign nationals do this shit. Like this is the same country that has the time, effort, and resources to terrorize PoC both at home and abroad. The same country that has sophisticated weaponry and whole ass organizations that deal exclusively in locking up black people and profiteering off of racist policies. \n\nBut when push comes to shove, America doesn’t even keep the same energy that they use to victimize us with. Instead, she rolls over and takes the abuse because the abuser is white. \n\nThe world should observe first hand that this is what happens when you build your system on inequality and refuse to address it. It’s no surprise to us minorities here in the US that they’ve been locking innocent children in cages. After all, law enforcement puts little black kids in cuffs and has no problem taking them to jail over little things. \n\nFascism has existed for many of us for centuries and is just now catching up with everyone else.

They know we are in a position where we wont fight back. Like actually fight back. Going past fucking protesting, going past sit-ins, going past writing letters and calling our congressmen.\n\n\n They know we wont use our firearms, burn down government buildings, and put corrupt politicians in prisons. Why? Because everybody is too afraid to lose their jobs that pay too little and working 60+ hours per week so we can feed ourselves and our families. They know we are too afraid and would rather let Russia slowly insert itself into America. They know this because they have already began a soft insertion. Yeah, yeah, call me a fucking lunatic and bat shit crazy, but take a look at **FRONT FUCKING PAGE!!!** Our goddamn president of our nation is being controlled or has allied himself with a foreign power. \n\n\nIf we want to get anywhere and take back our country, shit needs to be done like yesterday. Writing our representatives, protesting countless times, and praying for justice isn't fucking working people!\n\n\nGo ahead and wait another 2 fucking years, and try to replace Trump. They aren't going to let it happen because they have rigged the goddamn system. The proof of that is also on the front page here on reddit as well. We are going to have another 6 more years, if they don't extend term limits, of Trump and his treasonous actions. There's no telling what national information him and the rest of those traitors have given to Russia in the past 2 years. How much more do you think they will gain in the next 6? Fuck Mueller and his investigations, because by the time he is finished, it will be too late. He isn't acting fast enough to bring down this regime.\n\n**WE ARE LETTING RUSSIA TAKE OVER THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND WE ARE DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT!!**"

"What happens if the government official doesn't want to talk? \n\nWhat happens if Russia says the official lied or won't cooperate?\n\nCan Russia talk to any government official? Like our spies?...one would hope not. \n\nHow long does Russia get to question? \n\nCan answers to the questions be used against the person?\n\nWhat can the government official divulge? Certainly not classified info, obviously, but what about routine business we normally don't share with foreign governments? \n\nCan our government officials have an attorney present?\n\n\nWhy in the hell would any non-compromised President even consider this? "
'I hate this motherfucker so much.'
'It has taken a lot to break through the numbness that caused by the idiocy that comes from Trump in daily basis. This however did it. It’s both terrifying and Sickening.

'Putin wanted Chaos in the west. He underestimated the level of chaos he would get. He had no idea this man-baby would waddle his way into a quasi-nuclear showdown with NK in the first 6 months. He also thought that Donald was on open to his suggestion, not literally to any suggestion, (Kushner, Omarosa, Bannon, Fox and friends,Etc.) You wanted Chaos, now you have it Vlad.'

Even by Independent standards, this is absurdly misleading "journalism".'
'Shots fired. Watch Trump still kiss his ass'
'Putin was explicitly talking about George Bush and the American people, not Trump, but I understand what he is saying.  The lack of political awareness in America is shocking.  I am an immigrant, got my BA in Political Science in America, it is truly insane how uneducated about politics people are compared to many parts of Europe, and many parts of Europe actually know MORE about US politics than the average Joe, this has been my experience in real life and the classroom.'
"This burns, because any American with sense knows it's a valid criticism. Ignorance is at an all time high in the USA. But Putin is still a pompous jackass even if he is a rather clever and perceptive one. "
'Remember when Trump complained the world was mocking us under Obama?\n\nYeah, no.   THIS (1 example of many from the last 6 months) is what mocking us looks like.  '
'But... but... her    \nEMAILLLLLSSSSS!  \nStupid, selfish cowards who refused to vote for her because of mismanaging digital documents when the consequences of not voting for her were far, far more dire.  \n'
'He may be a brutal fascist murderer but he certainly has a point. Americans should be ashamed of how ignorant the majority of citizens are. Also, it is a disgrace that most of us refuse to read books anymore. They don\'t have the attention span to plow through even a lowly six hundred page book. I lost track of the number of books I have read that were at least that long. Reading a book is unique because you are using your brain to envision what is being conveyed. It probably activates certain regions of the brain otherwise dormant. The fact that so many of my fellow citizens refuse to read is shameful, and this perfectly human talent is being squandered because hey, now we have reality TV. This is especially true on reddit (*especially r/politics*), where when I quoted Shakespeare, I was retaliated against by the person linking /r/iamverysmart  and /r/im14andthisisdeep. Pathetic attempt at "winning" the conversation.'
"This is part of the plan. Install a moron. Manipulate him. The second he's gone off of script, use him to divide the country and harm it more. \n\nOdds are, we will see some leaks soon. Trump failed Putin by not delivering, so Putin will harm Trump. "

'What the fuck did he do to deserve congratulations from the president? He rigs the US election, poisons spies on allied soil last week, rigs the Russian election, then he gets a pat on the back from our president?  \n\nTrump talks more shit on people in his own fucking cabinet than he does on Putin.

"The fact that the chemical weapons terrorist attack wasn't mentioned greatly damages Nato.  Trump is destroying long standing alliances and strengthening Russia.\n\nTrump fully legitimizes Russia in this phone call.  Trump is a traitor and criminal of the highest order."
'Stupid people do stupid things. '

Russia . . . tax cuts have benefitted no one but 1% . . .jobs haven\'t come back ... stock market is falling ... opioids are killing us, physically and financially ... nothing  on guns .  . . trade tarrifs . . . Puerto Rico is still a goddamn mess ... net neutrality ...\n\nWhen he falls asleep every night, what goes through his head?  This guy who contribute d money to Hillary Clinton for years.\n\nHe\'s a product of an illegal immigrant. His German grandfather sneaked into America to follow the gold Rush. Opened whore houses. He avoided the war. The US sent him back to Germany but Germany didn\'t want him. \n\nTrump\'s lineage comes from a certified illegal immigrant.

'We are so fucked'
'So yeah why not congratulate the dictator that attacked and annexed another country and sending a spy to an Allie for a chemical attack. '
"I didn't even have to read the article first to know that his actions were followed by outrage from McCain, moderate disapproval from other republicans, and absolutely no action against the president by Congress whatsoever."
'I love the conservative going "well Obama congratulated him too!" as if trying to make this some non-issue\n\nObama was trying to reset relations with Russia, and Russia wasn\'t as publicly seen as a bad actor then.  Seeing as the crimean invasion was still a year or so off.  Meanwhile Trump congratulated him after the UK and our own government officials declared Russia attacked Britain with a nerve agent less than a month ago!\n\nPutin attacked our ally with a chemical weapon and Trump fucking congratulated him on winning re-election.\n\n\nTrump is seriously dead set on destroying relationships with our allies, and the Kremlin making it public was very much calculated for that effect.'

But during the campaign, she connected her father’s personal lawyer with a Russian athlete who offered to introduce Donald Trump to Putin to facilitate a 100\\-story Trump tower in Moscow, according to emails reviewed by BuzzFeed News and four sources with knowledge of the matter.  \n>  \n>There is no evidence that Ivanka Trump’s contact with the athlete — the former Olympic weightlifter Dmitry Klokov — was illegal or that it had anything to do with the election. Nor is it clear that Klokov could even have introduced Trump to the Russian president. But congressional investigators have reviewed emails and questioned witnesses about the interaction, according to two of the sources, and so has special counsel Robert Mueller’s team, according to the other two.\n\nIvanka getting in on the mess.

'1984 is and forever will be a guide on how to identify fascism and whether or not your country has already fallen. The aspect of fascism that Orwell focused on the most (and that shaped that dystopic society) was the manipulation of the truth, of reality itself.\n\n\nThe power Big Brother has to shape the truth to whatever suits their needs is the thing that keeps them in power, it allows them to control everyone and everything, for if no one knows the truth and reality changes every day, how can anyone know what is wrong or that there is even a problem? For fascists to stay in power, they must keep the people blind and what better to blind the people than to blind reality itself.\n\n\nAs Orwell wrote:\n\n"the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears, it was their final, most essential command."\n\n\n\nDo not let fascism rise again, how many more millions of people must die for the human race to get it, fascism is evil and all those who partake are thusly evil.

All the while, they will be working and receiving pay and benefits.\n\nAdditionally, when you're PNG'd you have to leave the country, like, *yesterday*...you have no more diplomatic protections, you have no visa, no legal permission to be there.  That means you have to take the next flight back to the states, regardless of cost.\n\nAll of your stuff has to be packed up and shipped out, last minute, which, again, raises costs by 25-50%.  On average, it costs anywhere from $100k-$250k to move a US diplomat (this is based on size of household, a limited amount of allowable weight, and where they are going to / coming from).\n\nYou have to break *every* lease of every person that is being sent home, again, this is penalty after penalty.\n\nYou have to fire / break the contracts of all the locally employed staff (LES's) who are Russians who work support jobs in the non-secure parts of the embassy.  This will likely mean paying out whole contracts and / large amounts of severance.\n\nClosed parts of the embassy will have to have all their equipment, computers, office furniture, etc, all shipped back to the US or a depot somewhere in Europe (probably), again, very expensive.\n\nEvery diplomat and their family who is sent home is guaranteed housing and meal support (per diem) for anywhere from 30-90 days, depending, while they get resettled.  Normally these costs are spread out over years.\n\nNow...finally...take all of this times 700.\n\nThis is going to cost the US at least $20 million (possibly up to $50 million) in the short term, probably and additional 50% of that in the mid term as all these PNG'd folks are re-language trained and/or reassigned.  In the long term (post-2020 or 2024), we will likely reestablish a larger diplomatic presence in Russia, which will likely carry a 10-25% premium because the US very rarely has to do this in non-warzones.\n\nAs a final clarification...in the sense that Russia is expelling US *diplomats*, that term is being applied to any US employee with diplomatic status.  Every major embassy has multiple missions, and they are not all State Department, but they *all* get diplomatic status.  The 700-ish likely includes FBI, Commerce, Treasury, FAA, DOD, USDA, and a handful of other agencies I'm not thinking about, but they play critical roles beyond diplomacy that deal with security, safety, and the economy. \n\n\n\n\n"

What, that they’re just a payroll expense? Just a headcount number?\n\nHow insulting and demoralizing for people who take their diplomatic jobs seriously, some in dangerous or hostile countries, that the president makes a statement like this. He’s basically just told every employee at a US embassy and consulate that their work isn’t important and they’re no more than a drag on the budget.\n\nDisgraceful.'

Well, for this ignorant fool, the choice was obvious... the lap dog is now licking the boot of his master and undermining our national security.  I cannot say I am surprised, but I am more disgusted than usual about the fact so many good citizens allowed this arrogant tripe to be in a position to represent our nation.  It is one thing for him to pander to his narrow-minded base, but now he is complicit with covering up an assault on this nation\'s institutions and gives this communist tyrant further motivation to repeat his interference in our democratic process.  Any Republicans able to look the other way or spout more hyperbolic rhetoric about "witch-hunt" are now just showing how much they are willing to sell out this nation\'s integrity in exchange for their petty need to feel like they are in charge.  The truth, as long as this moron sits in the White House, is that only chaos and confusion is running this nation, or ruining this nation.'

Trump is not scared at all by rank and file Lawyers, Russian operatives, Mafia types, or Municipal and State legislators. Like a mini mighty dictator he believes he can manipulate or beat them all. He is terrified, however, of Detectives, Auditors, Intelligence Agencies, and Journalist. They can spot the deception, voodoo economics, lies, sales pitches, and the proceeds of crime. \n\nOur problem: What happens to Democracy and the Law when the electorate or a jury are a combination of, the easily manipulated, the uneducated, have a short attention spans, are apathetic or have no moral standards. \n\nIt time for a new civil and moral awakening.

If that’s not traitorous speak, I really don’t know what is.\n\nEdit: Many of you are asking if the RNC was hacked, as well. Yes, it was. In this video, Trump said the RNC was fortified enough to defend from hacks, hence why they didn’t get hacked (Ahem, but they did get hacked, yes. I’m assuming that’s why all of the Republicans are scared, as their Kompromat could get revealed.)'
'>In an interview with "CBS Evening News" anchor Jeff Glor in Scotland on Saturday, President Trump named the European Union -- comprising some of America\'s oldest allies -- when asked to identify his "biggest foe globally right now."\n\n>"Well, I think we have a lot of foes. I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade. Now, you wouldn\'t think of the European Union, but they\'re a foe. Russia is foe in certain respects. China is a foe economically, certainly they are a foe. But that doesn\'t mean they are bad. It doesn\'t mean anything. It means that they are competitive," Mr. Trump said at his golf club in Turnberry, Scotland.\xa0\n\nWhen asked who our biggest foe is, the first name that popped into his head was the EU?'
'Donald Trump, on no uncertain terms, is attacking democratic treaty allies. The only foe here is Putin, and his puppet.'
'I think the headline buries the lead here.\n\n In the CBS News interview, Mr. Trump also continued to criticize the special counsel\'s Russia investigation, saying it is having an impact on America\'s standing in the world. "I think we\'re greatly hampered by this whole witch hunt that\'s going on in the United States," the president said. "I think it hurts our relationship with Russia. I actually think it hurts our relationship with a lot of countries. I think it\'s a disgrace what\'s going on."\n\nHe is STILL criticizing the russia investigation. He said more negative things about the Russia investigation than the actual russian act of war. Fucking insane.'
"The EU and NATO are enemies. Putin and Kim are good friends.\n\nIt's insane how quickly we became the bad guys."
'Trump thinks everyone is a foe, he has a victim complex inwhich he believes everyone is out to get him unless you prove to him otherwise. he thinks this way because he built his fortune out to get/take advantage of everyone.\n\nThe news media is out to get him  \nObama was out to get him  \nThe FBI is out to get him  \nHillary is out to get him  \nCohen is out to get him (now)\nMuslims are out to get America (and by extension, him)  \nMexicans are out to get America (and by extension, him)  \nChina is pout to get America (and by extension, him) \nThe EU is out to get America (and by extension, him) \nCanada is out to get America (and by extension, him)  \n\nAnd here is the scary part; Liberals are already seen as his foe, but eventually, when bit more of  the American people turn on him, every citizen that opposes him will be seen as his enemy as well.\n'
'Has he hit every point yet? \n\nThe methodology of tyranny\n\n**Control of public information and opinion - It begins with withholding information, and leads to putting out false or misleading information. A government can develop ministries of propaganda under many guises. They typically call it "public information" or "marketing".**\n\nVote fraud used to prevent the election of reformers - It doesn\'t matter which of the two major party candidates are elected if no real reformer can get nominated, and when news services start knowing the outcomes of elections before it is possible for them to know, then the votes are not being honestly counted.\n\n**Undue official influence on trials and juries - Nonrandom selection of jury panels, exclusion of those opposed to the law, exclusion of the jury from hearing argument on the law, exclusion of private prosecutors from access to the grand jury, and prevention of parties and their counsels from making effective arguments or challenging the government.**\n\nUsurpation of undelegated powers - This is usually done with popular support for solving some problem, or to redistribute wealth to the advantage of the supporters of the dominant faction, but it soon leads to the deprivation of rights of minorities and individuals.\n\nSeeking a government monopoly on the capability and use of armed force - The first signs are efforts to register or restrict the possession and use of firearms, initially under the guise of "protecting" the public, which, when it actually results in increased crime, provides a basis for further disarmament efforts affecting more people and more weapons.\n\nMilitarization of law enforcement - Declaring a "war on crime" that becomes a war on civil liberties. Preparation of military forces for internal policing duties.\n\nInfiltration and subversion of citizen groups that could be forces for reform - Internal spying and surveillance is the beginning. A sign is false prosecutions of their leaders.\n\n**Suppression of investigators and whistleblowers - When people who try to uncover high level wrongdoing are threatened, that is a sign the system is not only riddled with corruption, but that the corruption has passed the threshold into active tyranny**.\n\nUse of the law for competition suppression - It begins with the dominant faction winning support by paying off their supporters and suppressing their supporters\' competitors, but leads to public officials themselves engaging in illegal activities and using the law to suppress independent competitors. \n\n**Subversion of internal checks and balances - This involves the appointment to key positions of persons who can be controlled by their sponsors, and who are then induced to do illegal things. The worst way in which this occurs is in the appointment of judges that will go along with unconstitutional acts by the other branches.**\n\n**Creation of a class of officials who are above the law - This is indicated by dismissal of charges for wrongdoing against persons who are "following orders".**\n\nIncreasing dependency of the people on government - The classic approach to domination of the people is to first take everything they have away from them, then make them compliant with the demands of the rulers to get anything back again.\n\nIncreasing public ignorance of their civic duties and reluctance to perform them - When the people avoid doing things like voting and serving in militias and juries, tyranny is not far behind.\n\nUse of staged events to produce popular support - Acts of terrorism, blamed on political opponents, followed immediately with well-prepared proposals for increased powers and budgets for suppressive agencies. Sometimes called a Reichstag plot.\n\nConversion of rights into privileges - Requiring licenses and permits for doing things that the government does not have the delegated power to restrict, except by due process in which the burden of proof is on the petitioner.\n\n**Political correctness - Many if not most people are susceptible to being recruited to engage in repressive actions against disfavored views or behaviors, and led to pave the way for the dominance of tyrannical government.**\n\nAvoiding tyranny - The key is always to detect tendencies toward tyranny and suppress them before they go too far or become too firmly established. **The people must never acquiesce in any violation of the Constitution**. Failure to take corrective action early will only mean that more severe measures will have to be taken later, perhaps with the loss of life and the disruption of the society in ways from which recovery may take centuries.\n\nhttp://www.constitution.org/tyr/prin_tyr.htm'
"It's deliberate propaganda, straight out of the fascist playbook, meant to muddy the waters and dilute the meaning of words.\n\nThe word foe becomes meaningless if it can be applied to our enemies and allies alike. We've seen this happening with other terms.\n\n*both sides are the same* = when the GOP is corrupt, lies, or subverts democracy: **So what? Dems do it too. Both sides are the same.**\n\n*You think America is so innocent?* = when Russia carries out an attack on American democracy to manipulate a presidential election in their favor: **So what? America does it too. So it's okay that Russia did it to us.**\n\n*The EU is a foe, Russia can be a foe in some respects* = Trump is actively working with Russia as an ally even though Russia directly attacked American democracy: **So what? All nations can be foes of the United States in some respects. The EU is technically a foe of the United States and we work with them. So why shouldn't we have a good relationship with Russia?**\n\nKeep in mind, this strategy isn't to convince or confuse the Left and those who stand against Trump, nor is it to convince or confuse the Trump cult.\n\nIt's meant for the large portion of the population that is currently apathetic to politics. The ones that are currently more concerned with funding Kylie Jenner's kick starter than fund a political candidate. \n\nSo that by the time they decide to pay attention, there will be no clear truth. The truth will be relative to whatever those in power say it is.\n\n> *We've always been at war with the EU. Russia has always been our ally.*"

It means that they are competitive," Mr. Trump said at his golf club in Turnberry, Scotland. \n\nThis is partly why Trump is the personification of capitalism. What gets in my way of profit and power is my enemy. Russia, China, the EU. Doesn\'t matter. Compete against me in any way, for anything, anywhere and you\'re a foe. In a world that is adversarial and capitalist by design this is exactly what you get right here.'
'Jesus fucking Christ. Seriously? \n\nAt what point are Republicans going to drop their party bullshit and realize this guy and his admin are Russian puppets?'
"In a related story, I think Donald J. Trump is a foe to society in general and the fact hate groups adhere to him is evidence of the fact. I think his oh-so-many bankruptcies as a private businessman are further evidence. I think his fucking moronic antics we've seen over and over again since his campaigning in 2016 started, just nails home the point."

He then said just because they are a foe doesn’t mean they are all bad, just competitive. This tells me he doesn’t know the what the fuck the severity is to call a country a foe of America.\n\nOne the other hand, he’s a god damn rotten petty pathetic liar. So he probably just wanted to call the EU a foe (because he has adopted Putin’s goals) and just said the other ones to try and make it seem thoughtful or matter of fact.  Later he’ll just say he never said that and that the video and audio of him saying it is fake news.\n\nProbably it’s a bit of both.

I can't imagine how people like my dad and their families are feeling now, because it was dangerous then, and we knew it. I knew it at nine years old, because they told us, in no uncertain terms.

In the first instance, that's an awful deal for us; to have the very government responsible for the violation of our sovereignty oversee the investigation into that episode. \n\nBut even excluding that, how can the President of the United States justify his remarks on this deal without expressing some level of support for the sham investigations Russia has launched onto McFaul, Browder, et al.? If he won't come out and call it anything other than a sham, then he's aiding and abetting a hostile and murderous regime's attempts to discredit and possibly harm our own citizens.

"Browder started his campaign against Russia after his accountant, Sergei Magnitsky, uncovered a $230m Russian tax scam and was arrested then killed in prison.  \n\nBrowder more recently testified on the Russian election interference.\n\n>Browder, who testified at a congressional hearing in July on Russian election interference, said he was made aware that Russia had successfully placed him on Interpol’s list after he received an email from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Saturday informing him his “global entry status” had been revoked.\n\n>Four previous attempts by Russia to place Browder on the list failed; on each occasional. Interpol said the move was politically motivated.\n\nWhether or not you believe Browder's testimony, he is obviously being targeted for political reasons. I hope this is cleared up quickly. \n\n**Edit:** McCain and Cardin just issued a joint statement calling for this to be investigated. https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2017/10/statement-by-mccain-cardin-on-the-revocation-of-bill-browder-s-u-s-visa"

'How Putin got him on the Interpol list:\n\n> The latest charges against Browder from Russian prosecutors allege he colluded with British intelligence to kill Magnitsky by convincing prison doctors to deny him treatment.\n\nHilariously absurd lies to game the international legal system. Fuck Putin, that corrupt piece of shit. '
"[Thread from yesterday.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/782ri5/why_is_bill_browder_banned_from_america/)\n\n[Background from Bill Browder's Senate Testimony:\n](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/bill-browders-testimony-to-the-senate-judiciary-committee/534864/)\n\n> Russia has a well-known reputation for corruption; unfortunately, I discovered that it was far worse than many had thought. While working in Moscow I learned that Russian oligarchs stole from shareholders, which included the fund I advised. Consequently, I had an interest in fighting this endemic corruption, so my firm started doing detailed research on exactly how the oligarchs stole the vast amounts of money that they did. When we were finished with our research we would share it with the domestic and international media.\n> \n> For a time, this naming and shaming campaign worked remarkably well and led to less corruption and increased share prices in the companies we invested in. Why? Because President Vladimir Putin and I shared the same set of enemies. When Putin was first elected in 2000, he found that the oligarchs had misappropriated much of the president’s power as well. They stole power from him while stealing money from my investors. In Russia, your enemy’s enemy is your friend, and even though I’ve never met Putin, he would often step into my battles with the oligarchs and crack down on them.\n> \n> That all changed in July 2003, when Putin arrested Russia’s biggest oligarch and richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Putin grabbed Khodorkovsky off his private jet, took him back to Moscow, put him on trial, and allowed television cameras to film Khodorkovsky sitting in a cage right in the middle of the courtroom. That image was extremely powerful, because none of the other oligarchs wanted to be in the same position. **After Khodorkovsky’s conviction, the other oligarchs went to Putin and asked him what they needed to do to avoid sitting in the same cage as Khodorkovsky. From what followed, it appeared that Putin’s answer was, “Fifty percent.” He wasn’t saying 50 percent for the Russian government or the presidential administration of Russia, but 50 percent for Vladimir Putin personally. From that moment on, Putin became the biggest oligarch in Russia and the richest man in the world, and my anti-corruption activities would no longer be tolerated.**\n> \n> The results of this change came very quickly. On November 13, 2005, as I was flying into Moscow from a weekend away, I was stopped at Sheremetyevo airport, detained for 15 hours, deported, and declared a threat to national security.\n\n[More background.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/782ri5/why_is_bill_browder_banned_from_america/doqty4o/)\nOther threads from today: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/787bd4/state_department_reportedly_revokes_visit_of/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/787nkb/state_dept_revokes_visa_of_top_putin_critic_report/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/787vv6/trump_officials_suddenly_revoke_visa_of_hero/)."
'Putin won. He got what he wanted.\n\nExecutive Order 13223 gives the Secretary of Defense the power to recall retired military to service. https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/10/20/presidential-executive-order-amending-executive-order-13223\n\nThey\'re about to recall retired Air Force service-people specifically. They\'re about 1500 persons short. http://www.businessinsider.com/air-force-can-recall-1000-retired-pilots-to-address-personnel-crisis-2017-10\n\nAn Air Force base in California has been preparing to revive a policy we held during the Cold War, where we had a constant 24-hour cycle of planes carrying nuclear bombs. They did this to be ready to strike even more readily than any ICBMs could manage (I don\'t know about today\'s ICBM tech, but that\'s what the state of things were when they first enacted this policy back in the 60\'s). http://www.defenseone.com/threats/2017/10/exclusive-us-preparing-put-nuclear-bombers-back-24-hour-alert/141957/\n\nThe Magnitsky Act. The purpose of all of Putin\'s meddling. He hates it. Basically, it ties up all of Putin\'s Oligarch\'s money in banks. It "freezes his accounts" sort-of-speak. The man responsible for getting this act passed, and keeping it from being revoked is Bill Browder. He is one of Putin\'s harshest critics. He was friends with Sergei Magnitsky, the man who died in prison because he found the paper-trail proving corruption (he just didn\'t realize that it was autocrat-authorized corruption). Bill fled to the US and has been a very vocal opponent of Putin.\n\nAnd guess who just had his Visa revoked? https://news.vice.com/story/bill-browder-visa-revoked-putin\n\nThis is not the whole story. Trump has shown himself time and time again to be a Putin ally. But we\'re about to see some serious changes. Trump will start a war, either in NK or Afghanistan (he\'s teed himself up to attack both) and we\'ll miss the Magnitsky fallout. Putin will get his power back (aka money). And he will have won.'
"Wait for what!? \n\nIsn't this the guy that gave that pretty damning account of his dealings that basically exposed Putin as a Mafia type Don and all the crazy stuff that led to the Trump/adoption/meeting thing?\n\nThe same guy who gave his testimony the day/week Trump did the boy scouts speech, transgenders in the military ban and Police brutality joke so that it went completely off the radar.

You start getting shit straighten out and the Russian companies profitable.  Your assets than get seized and your lawyer/accountant is arrested and tortured to death.  I would be pissed too if this happened to me.\n\nThat was a very basic explanation of what happened"
'"No puppet, you\'re a puppet." -Classic Trump projection, I\'m sure he\'s been experiencing the early signs of dementia, but in this case there\'s no doubt he\'s fully aware of being a puppet. In fact, it was probably a conscious decision trump made to keep the russian money flowing his way.'
'It\'s crazy that our first reaction is that "Trump is colluding with Russia on this." and we wouldn\'t be wrong to assume that based on the last year. \n\nCan\'t wait for this shit to be over. '
"He's been a thorn in Putins side for a long time and Putin has tried without success to have him blacklisted for many years.\n\nNow,  for some bizarre reason,  the stars are aligned for Putin and oddly the American government seems to want to suck Russian balls.  "
"Russia now claims that Browder killed Magnitsky by colluding with British intelligence to persuade the Russian doctors at the Russian prison to withhold medical treatment.\n\nHere's what they are saying then. The Russian government can't control its own employees. The Russian government is incompetent and unable to prevent the death of their prisoners from a treatable illness. And the Russian intelligence agencies can't stop one man from bringing down their entire klepotcracy by brilliant intelligence operation to kill a lawyer after having him falsely arrested.\n\nDoes that sound even a little bit like it might be reasonable? Because to me this sounds like the plot of a bad dime novel that never made it to print. "
'Predictably, i see comments blaming Trump of "doing Putin\'s will!".\n\nLet me save you a click. He was put on the Interpol list of wanted **by Putin**,. through a loop hole. He cant fly or receive a visa, because the moment he pops up, he will be arrested by Interpol.\n\n>On Saturday it emerged that Russia had placed the US-born British citizen on Interpol’s list, exploiting a loophole that lets countries unilaterally place individuals on its database used to request an arrest. Browder said he was alerted to the move by an email from the US department of homeland security, \n\nRussia hates him, the DHS under Trump warned him that Russia was trying to fuck him over.\n\n'
'Trump can use lame excuses like "bone spurs" to get out of his Vietnam obligation but Browder is LITERALLY fighting a war against Putin and we can\'t even cut the guy a break with his visa.\n\nGood job Trump..  you loser.'
"At least I can't call people idiots here for not reading the article, because Vice themselves fucked it up.  What happened is Bill Browder's visa waiver got revoked, not his visa.  US CBP has a Visa Waiver Program that uses a system called the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) to allow travelers from some countries to visit the US without receiving a visa where it would otherwise be required.  Browder's ESTA record got flagged for rejection.  If he'd had a formal visa, this wouldn't have been an issue in the first place but it's pretty apparent that some sort of automated process with the ESTA system flagged Browder in response to the Interpol status change, and thus caused the problem.\n\nAs of four hours ago, from the time of this post, his ESTA record was fixed and he's able to fly back to the US.  There is no conspiracy here, no Trump pulling strings for Putin, it's just an regular process not being tailored for every single person and specific circumstance in the world."
'Is there any chance any other countries involved in Interpol would actually have him arrested and sent to Russia?\n\nI mean... considering he would likely be tortured to death the moment he stepped off the plane.'

"The American President meeting with the leader from Russian on a trip to Asia is not at all nefarious and is to be expected. It's not supsicious at all... WHAT IS SUSPICIOUS is when they meet privately and they don't release any notes of the meeting to the public like what happened in July at the G20. That's suspicious as fuck... As if they don't want us to know what they talked about. It's also suspicious that only Rex Tillerson was with Trump on the American side for that meeting. As if they didn't want anybody else outside of the President's direct orbit to hear what they talked about. That's also pretty fucking suspicious. "
"He's a moron. If you're under investigation for drugs, you don't go to a known drug dealers' house. He should be staying as far away from Putin as possible. At least have someone else have the meeting. I can't wait until his fat ass is impeached."
"Putin fucked with our elections. Trump doesn't want to confront him on it. Fine, I actually get that logic, twisted as it is. \n\nOther Republican leaders though? Shameful. Disgraceful. Traitorous. \n\nTrump voters who insist that the story is nothing? You do so because you WANT it to be nothing. You aren't evaluating truth; you're picking your 'facts' to justify your feelings. Sorry to bash regular Americans, but you'll never be able to was off the shame you are covering yourself with, and when I hear how bad your communities are, your unemployment problems, your opiod problems, I can't give you my full sympathy because you refuse to live in full reality."
'Trump cries "witch hunt!" Then meets "witch" for lunch. '
"The frustrating thing is that no matter what Putin does in this situation, he still comes on top. Meets with Trump? Suspicious as fuck. Doesn't meer with Trump? Suspcious as fuck. That suspcion works to his advantae and it angers me how all of this controversy plays into his hands. Regardless of what the Trump Adminiatration does, he still comes out on  top because he has stirred the pot and made an example of US of the weak nature of democracy. All by exploiting weaknesses already present in our country. He played us at our own game."
"I've said this earlier and elsewhere but, as this week's elections show, the political pendulum will eventually swing back the other way. When sanity comes back to DC whoever is in charge will need to smack down Russia so the interference not only stops but never happens again. Whatever form that takes, it will harden tensions to a degree almost none of us have experienced. The American blow-back, its ripple effect, the potential escalation, all of it plead for the idea that Russia has made a terrible mistake in carrying this outright, wall-to-wall assault on US democracy. And it doesn't bode well for the future.\n\nAnd that's just the tip of America's current problems. Tough times ahead , mates. Tough times."

"It's seriously extraordinary that many people (on the right) still believe that Trump is not working with Russia.\n\nA) He's made it so exceedingly obvious and, B) So many people, including people who aren't Republicans, are still unwilling to accept the full reality of this fundamental fact. I mean, a sitting US President refuses to enforce Russian sanctions, frequently meets with Russians, has a team almost entirely up to their necks in specifically Russian connections, trashes NATO, fulfills all of Russia's geopolitical goals, meets with Putin, in private, with literally no other Americans in the room to provide witness for what he's saying. All in less than a year. That's mind-blowing. That's legitimately one of the craziest things to ever happen in politics, period. It's unheard of for a leader of a nation as wealthy, powerful and large as the US to have a leader so hopelessly, obviously compromised by the leader of a much weaker nation and everyone just sort of shrugs.\n\nI mean, I truly don't know how to comprehend the level of denial. I'm just waiting for the aftershock when most of the population finally catches on. Watching it slowly dawn on all the majority of of America that the President is a really stupid, gullible Russian asset."
'Pandora\'s box has been opened, and no amount of propoganda is going to wipe that from the public\'s mind. They have a single word to associate with Trump now, just like Hillary\'s been (Unfairly) haunted by  the word "Emails". \n\nTrump really screwed up. There\'s no recovering from this on any front except the measily 10% that are still buying into Russian propoganda. '
'Watched it live, and the thing I took away most was this: Putin did an excellent job with actually listening to and answering the questions asked by journalist. Meanwhile, Trump answered everything by ranting on meaningless talking-points he’s been repeating for ages that not only had little to do with the question, but also led nowhere (he’d talk off-topic to the point where he’d forget the actual question). \n\nSimply, Trump and Putin could’ve been arguing the size of the burger patty on a whopper, and Putin would’ve owned him just based on rhetoric and discourse. \n\nAs an American, every time this hypocritical human carrot opens his mouth is humiliating. '
'Trump is terrible he is the most un american president i have ever seen. what president just praises putin and throws america under the bus. Impeach trump for treason acting against america whenever russia is around. GOP do something you spineless idiots. GOP backs trump with anything forget about what is best for America. What a dumb terrible president. He is the worst president in modern history.   '
"Another day of Trump being president, another day of outraged Reddit comments but no real protest to speak of.\n\nLet's go America. You have the power to protest, which is far more powerful than you seem to think it is. However bad you think Trump is, realize that up to now you have done nothing about it. Not because you can't, but because you don't want to.\n\nTime to change that. Protest. All of you. If you have no critical position such as nurse or firefighter, inform your bosses you will not show up to work next friday to execute your right to protest a failing government.\n\nIf only enough of you actually did something.

They would much rather get rid of him on any of the other smaller scale things (preferably something like lying under oath about a sex scandal) because the rest of the world would be able to swallow that.'

If everyone does it then it\'s not really bad.  If everyone does it, then it\'s totally unfair that HE gets criticized and investigated for it.  So he\'s convinced it\'s a witch hunt, because he cannot possibly conceive the idea that maybe he\'s the bad guy and others aren\'t.'
'Are there no Republicans law makers who will stand with the American people? Impeach now, let Muller finish his investigation and fully punish these traitors!!'
'So he has been aiding and abetting a foreign adversary in a conspiracy. Can we all seriously contact our senators and representatives and tell them to impeach now? '
'"I don\'t see why they would do it" indeed, you chucklehead. They have all become so brazen about this, it\'s fucking infuriating. I\'d repeat the maxim to vote Democrat this November, but the voting system itself is compromised with no clear attempts to fix it. The fuck. It feels so damn hopeless.'
"Are we at the point where belief Trump's fact? His base is so stupid and programmed with bad information via murdoch, are they immune to real information?"
"No collusion yet several key Trump campaign officials have been indicted/ arrested or both. \n\nEdit: I see people saying that their charges are unrelated/ not specified towards collusion with Russia. That may be officially true at the moment, however, Manafort and Gates have been charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. While Papadopoulos and Flynn lied about their Russian connections before and during the election. This raises red flags about the integrity of Trump's campaign. Also, remember the Mueller Investigation is not over yet, no matter the House's premature closure of their investigation. \n\n https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/20/17031772/mueller-indictments-grand-jury "
'What upsets me about this is that a lot of people who are only partially informed won\'t know the difference between the House Investigation and the Special Council investigation. To them this will be vindication of the president.\n\nEDIT: I am by no means an expert on this. I\'m just a weird Australian who is moderately informed. Please correct me if I\'m wrong about any of this:\n\nBut to to those who asked, yes Mueller\'s investigation is completely separate from The House Intel Commitee.\n\nThe HIC Russia probe started before Mueller\'s investigation. It is - or is meant to be - a bipartisan investigation into Russian election interference. It is run by the Republican majority and the Dem Minority. Right from the start it has been plagued by partisan hackery. \n\nAs it stands there are several key witnesses not yet interviewed. The Republican Majority has willingly turned a blind eye to shitloads of evidence and ultimately, they ended the probe before even informing the Dem Minority. They blindsided them.\n\nThere\'s a pretty interesting statement from Dem Minority leader Adam Schiff\'s in regards to this.\n\nAs for Mueller, he was appointed by Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein in response to Comeys firing and the leaked memos. Mueller is a completely seperate entity from the House Intel Commitee. Rosenstein has stated he sees no reason to end the investigation so for now Mueller is safe.\n\nIt\'s worrying though in the sense that so many people - on both sides of aisle - will see the words "no collusion" which will stick and ultimately the damage is done.\n\nAnd ultimately Trump will exploit that for all it\'s worth. There\'s the possibility he could even use this to fire Rosenstein (who is the only one with the power to actual fire Mueller)'
'(Not)Cliffs Notes: The same group of Republicans behind lying and misrepresenting the Carter Page FISA Warrants in the Nunes Memo have announced they will soon be releasing a new memo lying about and misrepresenting Russian Interference. '
">**The report will go further and suggest that to the extent that any Russians acted on behalf of either candidate, it was for Hillary Clinton**. That contentious finding is included in the context of discussing the role of the Christopher Steele dossier that was compiled on behalf of an opposition research firm contracted by a law firm connected to the DNC and the Clinton campaign.\n\nMan ... how does Clinton do it all? I mean ... she's able to murder Seth Rich, run a pedophile sex-trafficking ring out of the basement of a pizza parlor, leak national secrets to terrorists, lie (and not get caught) about Benghazi through hearing after hearing, and now you're telling me she also had time to collude with the Russians? Incredible! /s"
'**Action plan** if this is used as a pretext to fire Mueller and his separate investigation which has so far indicted 19 individuals and three companies, and has gotten **five guilty pleas**..\n\nhttps://act.moveon.org/event/mueller-firing-rapid-response-events/search/'

That was a bipartisan bill, something very rare these days. He did say he would sign it, right? This is outrageous. He had as well claim his allegiance to Moscow. He doesn\'t understand, this is not another a Trump business. Trump works for us now. This is a job, with a salary. Our representatives acted on our behalf, and he is refusing our demands. He is either a coward who is unwilling to stand up to Putin for attacking our democracy, or Putin has control over our president, and the United Stated is now pushing a Russian Agenda. This is treason, for real. I know that only applies during a time of war, but what do you people think this is that is happening? **We are being attacked**, war is being waged against our very **democracy**, and Trump is aiding our enemy. They literally scrubbed "to promote freedom and democracy" from the United States mission statement. He should be protecting us, and signing that sanctions bill, pronto, but instead he proposes we abandon our values, and just toss our allies aside to support and endorse a brutal Russian regime who is nothing less than our mortal fucking enemy.

"Ben Cardin jump started the Magnitsky Act and was a crucial player in bringing Magnitisky's murderers to justice. He is more aware of Russian corruption and illegal activities than almost any congressman."
'>JANUARY 10, 2018\n\n>**U.S. SENATOR BEN CARDIN RELEASES REPORT DETAILING TWO DECADES OF PUTIN’S ATTACKS ON DEMOCRACY, CALLING FOR POLICY CHANGES TO COUNTER KREMLIN THREAT AHEAD OF 2018, 2020 ELECTIONS**\n\n>-\n\n>*U.S. Remains Vulnerable to Russian Interference without Unequivocal Presidential Leadership, Learning Lessons from European Democracies* \n\n>*Top Foreign Relations Committee Democrat Makes Series of Recommendations to Counter Putin’s Asymmetric Arsenal, Bolster Defenses Ahead of Future U.S., European, Elections*\n\n>-\n\n>WASHINGTON – A [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Democratic staff report](https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/FinalRR.pdf) released Wednesday and commissioned by U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.), the Committee’s ranking member, details Russian president Vladimir Putin’s nearly two decades-long assault on democratic institutions, universal values, and the rule of law across Europe and in his own country. The report comes one year after Senator Cardin introduced the Counteracting Russian Hostilities Act of 2017, which served as the basis for the sanctions package signed into law last August, and makes a series of recommendations to adequately bolster U.S. and European defenses and counter the growing Kremlin threat to democratic institutions.\n\n>“[Putin’s Asymmetrical Assault on Democracy in Russia and Europe: Implications for U.S. National Security](https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/FinalRR.pdf),” finds that President Trump’s refusal to publicly acknowledge the threat posed by the Russian government has hampered efforts to mobilize our government, strengthen our institutions, and work with our European allies to counter Putin’s interference in democracies abroad.\n\n>Never before in American history has so clear a threat to national security been so clearly ignored by a U.S. president, and without a strong U.S. response, institutions and elections here and throughout Europe will remain vulnerable to the Kremlin’s aggressive and sophisticated malign influence operations.\n\n>**“As the extent of Russia’s obvious meddling in the 2016 U.S. election continues to be investigated, it is imperative that the American people better understand the true scope and scale of Putin’s pattern of undermining democracy in Russia and across Europe. That is why I commissioned this report shortly after the 2016 election,”** Senator Cardin said. **“This threat existed long before President Trump took office, and unless he takes action now, it will continue long after his administration.  While President Trump stands practically idle, Mr. Putin continues to refine his asymmetric arsenal and look for future opportunities to disrupt governance and erode support for the democratic and international institutions that the United States and Europe have built over the last 70 years.**\n\n>**“President Trump must be clear-eyed about the Russian threat, take action to strengthen our government’s response and our institutions, and – as have other president’s in times of crisis – mobilize our country and work with an international coalition to counter the threat and assert our values,”** Cardin continued.\n\n>Across eight chapters and several appendices, the report meticulously details the tools the Russian government has repeatedly deployed from its asymmetric arsenal, and how the Kremlin has learned and perfected its techniques attacking democracy both internally and abroad. Such tools – drawn largely from a Soviet-era playbook, but updated with new technologies – include military incursions, cyberattacks, disinformation, support for fringe political groups, and the weaponization of energy resources, organized crime and corruption.\n\n>Putin first developed his techniques at home, against his own people. In Russia, he repressed independent civil society, journalists, and the political opposition, while manipulating cultural and religious institutions, the media, and fueling a corrupt kleptocracy to bolster his regime and increase his net worth. Putin’s increasing aggression abroad is directly related to his need to maintain power at home. As he looks to maintain power in Russia, he is likely to step up his attacks on democracies around the world.\n\n>Some European countries have shored up their democracies with a strategic, whole-of-government approach: publicly warning Moscow of consequences if it meddles; mobilizing various sectors of society to neutralize and push back against Kremlin disinformation; and confronting Russian efforts to use corruption as a tool of influence. It is time for the United States to take similar actions.\n\n>-\n\n>The report includes more than 30 recommendations for the U.S. and its allies.  Key recommendations include:\n\n>* **First,** Mr. Trump must demonstrate presidential leadership by declaring it is U.S. policy to deter all forms of Russian hybrid threats and begin to mobilize our government in defense. He should establish a high-level inter-agency fusion cell, modeled on the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), to coordinate all elements of U.S. policy and programming in response to the Kremlin’s malign influence operations.\n\n>* **Second,** the U.S. government should provide assistance, in concert with allies in Europe, to build democratic institutions within those European and Eurasian states most vulnerable to Russian government interference. As part of this effort, the President should convene an annual global summit on hybrid threats, modeled on the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL or the Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) summits. To reinforce these efforts, members in the U.S. Congress have a clear responsibility to show U.S. leadership on values by making democracy and human rights a central part of their agendas. They should conduct committee hearings and use other platforms and opportunities to publicly advance these issues. \n\n>* **Third,** the United States and our allies should expose and freeze Kremlin-linked dirty money.  The U.S. Treasury Department should make public any intelligence related to Mr. Putin’s personal corruption and wealth stored abroad, and take steps with our European allies to cut off Mr. Putin and his inner circle from the international financial system.\n\n>* **Fourth,** the U.S. government should designate countries that employ malign influence operations to assault democracies as State Hybrid Threat Actors and subject them to a preemptive, escalatory sanctions regime that would be applied whenever the state uses asymmetric weapons like cyberattacks to interfere with a democratic election or disrupt a country’s critical infrastructure. The U.S. government should also produce yearly public reports that detail the Russian government’s malign influence operations in the U.S. and around the world.\n\n>* **Fifth,** the U.S. government and NATO should lead a coalition of countries committed to mutual defense against cyberattacks, to include the establishment of rapid reaction teams to defend allies under attack. The U.S. government should also call a special meeting of the NATO heads of state to review the extent of Russian government-sponsored cyberattacks among member states and develop formal guidelines on how the Alliance will consider such attacks in the context of NATO’s Article 5 collective defense provision.\n\n>* **Finally,** U.S. and European governments should mandate that social media companies make public the sources of funding for political advertisements, along the same lines as TV channels and print media. Social media companies should conduct comprehensive audits on how their platforms may have been used by Kremlin-linked entities to influence elections occurring over the past several years, and should establish civil society advisory councils to provide input and warnings about emerging disinformation trends and government suppression. In addition, they should work with philanthropies, governments, and civil society to promote media literacy and reduce the presence of disinformation on their platforms.\n\n>-\n\n>The full report and some accompanying summary documents can be found at the following links:\n\n>* [**Full report**](https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/FinalRR.pdf)\n\n>* [**Preface and Executive Summary pullout**](https://www.foreign.senate.gov/download/rr-preface-and-exec-sum)\n\n>* [**Summaries and illustrative examples from individual chapters**](https://www.foreign.senate.gov/download/chapter-summaries-rr)\n\n>* [**Appendices pullout**](https://www.foreign.senate.gov/download/appendices-pullout)\n\n>-\n\n>\\###'

This is as close to all out war as you can get without firing a single bullet. I maintain that the Cold War never ended in Russia, and we\'ve been caught with our pants down.'

"I'm confused. Is this worse than POTUS using Grey Poupon?"
">“I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.”\n\nBush thought he had a good sense for Putin after hearing a sob story about Putin finding a cross in a burned-out dacha, but even he had a rude awakening the more he got to know just how conniving and calculated Putin is. Bush only later realized that Putin, a former spy, had played him and his born again Christian ideology to make a fool of him with a half-baked story about faith that was a godsend for PR relations.\n\nIt was one thing back then-we didn't know much about Putin and his behavior. But this is over a decade later and we know how he governs now, we know about his suppression of journalists and dissidents, and we know about how he allows his FSB to perform false-flag terrorist attacks within his own country to keep the people scared and easily manipulable. Trump's a fool at best, and complicit at worst. \n\nPutin was *literally* trained as a spy. Connecting to people and manipulating is *what he does*. If anyone's interested in more, I'd **strongly** recommend Masha Gessen's *The Man Without a Face*. \n\nSide note, how ironic is it that people who believe 9/11 was an inside job and that our politicians are running a pedophile sex ring in a nonexistent pizzeria basement idolize Putin?\n\nThey refuse to look at or acknowledge evidence that implicates him in the apartment bombings in the late nineties during his first election, as well as in the deaths of many journalists who have investigated that case (an FSB agent *literally* slipped up and had a member of the Duma announce one of the bombs three days before it went off). Or how about the fact that he probably had some role in allowing the Moscow Theater Siege, which left over a hundred dead, to happen? There's got to be a reason why an alleged FSB agent was with the terrorists and slipped out just before the police went in, especially when you realize that several of the terrorists were supposed to be in prison, indicating some extra-legal maneuvering was used to get them out."

Notions such as 'law', mores, and morality are all secondary considerations at this point.  Once you realize that power for the sake of power is the order of the day then things will start to make a lot more sense.  Your institutions will not save you.  Your courts will not save you.  Only you, the people can save you, and your people have been trained to hate each other.  One half of your working class has been conditioned to murder the other half if circumstances dictate.  Realize that your military class is not taken from the poorest and most marginalized from among you.  Rather they are a suburban, rich, and white warrior class that sees the 'other' as enemy."

"I was listening to a good interview with him on NPR earlier this morning.  He's fully willing to stand up to Putin and speak the truth.  He knows that scumbag had Magnitsky killed, and he also knows why Putin hates him so much.  He's currently a British citizen, so there is exactly zero chance he will be turned over.  "
"Putin is terrified of this man because he knows the truth about Russian's murderous kleptocracy and is a tireless advocate for sanctions. "
'After more than three months of untreated pancreatitis and gallstones, Sergei Magnitsky went into critical condition. The Butyrka authorities did not want to have responsibility for him, so they put him in an ambulance and sent him to another prison that had medical facilities. But when he arrived there, instead of putting him in the emergency room, they put him in an isolation cell, chained him to a bed, and eight riot guards came in and beat him with rubber batons.\n\nThat night he was found dead on the cell floor.\n\n'
"And Trump is floating the idea of allowing it.\n\nI fear were not far off from this leading to corpses. Putin already managed to move the goalposts by pushing a completely unacceptable request and having it met with an actual lukewarm response by the Trump admin. If he can get away with that, then it follows that they will try worse and worse things until they finally hit a point where they actually meet unwavering resistance. \n\nThe thing is, Trump likely doesn't have it in him to ever get to that point to tell Putin to stop."

He knows Russia helped him but he will never fess up to it because (1) he\'s a liar, (2) he doesn\'t want to admit that his presidency could be illegitimate, (3) he owes Putin something for all of the hacking that he was very much aware of ("Russia, if you\'re listening...")\n\nNo shit the trip should be canceled. We have a fucking traitor in office who doesn\'t serve his country.'
'Trump would be a idiot to go to it. This will basically confirm what everyone like myself knew all along, & will also make Republicans/GOP in congress look bad. '
"Putin's number one goal is to fuck shit up. He'll meet Trump in Helsinki to let him suck his dick some more, which will show the world Trump is loyal to Putin even in light of the new indictments. Once Trump is fully committed, then Putin can drop whatever kompromat he has for maximum effect."

'> A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear.\n\n\n― Marcus Tullius Cicero'
'Sorry for being kind of out of the loop on this, but what exactly did Trump do that was so treasonous? '
"Our president stood on stage and said the Democrats should be ashamed that they were hacked.  He didn't turn to Putin and condemn him for doing it.  Our president is powerless to protect our democracy. He is unfit to lead this country- has been since the start, but he proves it more daily. "
"He's either a spy or grossly incompetent.  Either way he needs to get the boot. "
"god damn americans are soft as fuck.\nstanding by as this president shakes hands with a slimy dictator who's constantly trying to ruin the state of the union "
"I don't think enough republicans would vote for impeachment. What we need to do is take the republican majority from the house and the senate. If this happens trump's presidency and agenda will be dead in the water"
"It's at least time for the Republicans in Congress to grow a fucking spine. Right now everyone is sucking Trump's dick out of fear of being primaried, and Trump is sucking Putin's dick out of fear of being peemaried. You want off that ride, Republicans? Here's your goddamn chance; take it, you might not get another."
"Non-American here. I don't think that it was that bad. Sure, Trump is a fucking idiot but what crimes did he commit by meeting Putin and being an idiot? None as far as I can see. "
'I hate Trump.\n\nWhen he won I told myself "Maybe it won\'t be all that bad" and to give him a chance.\n\nIt\'s actually been worse that I thought it would be.'
"It's time for **prosecution** for treason, subversion of democracy, dereliction of duty and acting as an agent of a foreign power.\n\nAnd 4+ decades of money laundering... And I am sure there are a litany of other violations worthy or FBI attention.\n\nTrump is dirtier than a whore house after a hurricane."
'Pence is a crazy twat too :('
'Beto is a sponsor of a bill in congress that uses propaganda and all around dumb fuckery to ban the majority of rifles sold in the United States. We chose the wrong democrat to run in Texas. We could\'ve retaken the senate but instead we chose a Pelosi bot with a nice smile. We need to pay better attention. This dude is waaayy out of touch with the voters. \n\nBeto classifies any semi-automatic rifle as an "assault weapon" if it has one additional feature such as an adjustable stock.....or a pistol grip..... That\'s the majority of rifles made. It doesn\'t matter what caliber. Oh and did you see that if your rifle has a "rocket launcher" on it its an assault rifle....FFS I think they purposely wrote it to include all rifles because all of them have a forward grip and then added "rocket launcher" to encourage any senator that didn\'t know anything about firearms to think "Oh my GOD they have rocket launchers???"\n\nhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5087/text\n\nFrom the bill:\n\n\n"The term ‘semiautomatic assault weapon’ means any of the following, regardless of country of manufacture or caliber of ammunition accepted:\n\n“(A) A semiautomatic rifle that has the capacity to accept a detachable magazine and any one of the following:\n\n“(i) A pistol grip.\n\n“(ii) A forward grip.\n\n“(iii) A folding, telescoping, or detachable stock.\n\n“(iv) A grenade launcher or rocket launcher.\n\n“(v) A barrel shroud.\n\n“(vi) A threaded barrel.\n\nTed Cruz is really unpopular but we\'ve managed to run a pro-ban Pelosi clone in *Texas*..... Sorry if I sound cynical but What In The Fuck Were We Thinking???? '
'It’s way past time.  \n\nSo much damage is already done.  \n\nAnd this is the “easy” part, compared to cleaning up the whole monumental mess that got us here.\n\nImpeachment is not an end goal. It’s not a big win. It’s step 1.'
"No no no, don't you see? The test turned out to show that most people won't accept what he said at the press conference, so now he's altered reality back to blaming Russia.\n\nThis is all part of the process of seeing how far people can accept his warping of the truth. Even now, the test to see if people accept his backtracking is in effect. How many people will accept it? That's the data his bosses need."

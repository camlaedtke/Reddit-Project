Trump's Mar-a-Lago trips cost more than trans soldiers' health care
Susan Collins withstood intense pressure to vote against health care repeal
GOP about to pass secret health care bill while they think no one’s paying attention
"Ohhh wow awaiting trump's meltdown tomorrow aimed at mccain"
'McCain actually did it.\n\nGood job, senator. \n\nKeep up the good work. '

"This is a historic moment. And as I watch, Mitch McConnell is trying to blame this on anyone but the GOP.\n\nTruth is, no one wanted this, not even the GOP.\n\nThe road forward is either Single Payer or to make ObamaCare fixed.\n\nThe end results means one single thing:\n\nWE WON, those who spoke, emailed, wrote letters, called, and otherwise contacted congress.\n\nWe have done this. And we have reason to be proud. Now, we need to fix the problems that exist with the ACA or to move to Single Payer.\n\nMore important, we need to keep arguing to get this incapable admin out of office. It may be that we need to press congress to keep Bob Mueller on the job, there is currently a law composed by Senator Graham to prevent Trump from firing Mueller.\n\nOur nation has other very important goals to discuss.\n\nLet's get to it.\n\nThe democrats are reaching out to work through these things.\n\nWill the GOP work or help with this?\n\nLet's do this."
'~~Thank you~~ ~~fuck you~~ thank you, John McCain.'
'Maverick saved us in his final hour. '
"In the end, it was the Maverik, the 08' challenger to President Obama himself, that tipped the scales and saved Obama's legacy. Just remember, those scales wouldnt have tipped if Sen. Murkowski and Sen. Collins hadn't been there from the start. All three of them deserve our highest praise."
"Honestly it's just funny at this point how many times they have failed to get rid of ObamaCare"
"Holy fuck it's an amazing feeling to have a little bit of hope restored."
'To everyone who said that McCain has no integrity; He just personally saved obamacare.  '
'Huge moment from McCain.  Walking down the aisle and giving the thumbs down and a loud no.  I fist pumped the air.'
'How I wish to be a fly on the wall in the room with Trump right now'
'I like to believe McCain set them up for this very moment. If only to rationalize working for him in 08. '
'Alright, we can go back to kinda liking McCain until he votes on something stupid.'
"Millions of people aren't going to die today.\n\nThanks McCain, Collins, and Murkowski for showing us there is some conscious in this clusterfuck of a governing body."
'I will not forget that one of my Senators -- Rubio -- voted for this and for every other prior version that would hurt millions of Americans.\n\nAs you celebrate, do not forget those senators who were willing to do this.\n\nWhether they come up for re-election next year, 2020 or in 2022, ***do not forget***.\n\n'
'Brilliant strategic move by McCain, and perhaps a final patriotic FuckYOU to the monumental assclowns who would besmirch the American legacy he fought to preserve. '

'Someone should start a website tallying how much it costs the tax payers for each of Trumps golf trips.  My understanding is that it costs millions of dollars for each of his trips. I think it would send a powerful message by showing the accumulative amount it is costing the tax payers.'

'Oh, so you want to cut spending to balance the budget? how about this, end the war on drugs by disbanding the DEA and pushing that all back to the states - $15billion saved of which $14billion can be used to fund the healthcare program and a $1billion gain. How about those agricultural subsidies that come to the tune of $25billion per year - lets get rid of that along with getting rid of protectionism on imported sugar so you can get rid of HCFS which might end up saving money in terms of healthcare costs.  Amazing how the first port of call for those cutting spending tends to be cutting programmes that help the least fortunate among us.'

"He still is a hero to some. Not me, but look at it from other's perspectives. I'm middle class and the ACA has done nothing for me. Do I think it should be repealed? No. But there are people who do.

"Do we really have to act like he invented a country that doesn't exist, rather than simply screwed the name up though?\n\nThere are a million better things to criticize this guy for than an embellished headline like this.  Even in this story.... for instance is Namibia's healthcare even worth praising?"

He mispronounced the name twice: that implies that it wasn't just a slip of the tongue. He didn't learn how to pronounce it, which means in all likelihood he had never even heard of Namibia before someone told him he had to talk about it. Foreign relations is one of the most important jobs of the president, and an area that he and his administration have great control over, I'm not okay with him being ignorant. I mean, how hard would it have been for him to learn how to pronounce Namibia? It looks exactly as it sounds."

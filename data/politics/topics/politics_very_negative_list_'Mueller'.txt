"> President Trump ordered the firing last June of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation, according to four people told of the matter, but ultimately backed down after the White House counsel threatened to resign rather than carry out the directive.\n\nThat's insane. He *should* be impeached for even attempting to obstruct justice in such a way (but obviously Republicans are too cowardly to choose country over party). This is an absolute **bombshell** report from the Times."
'Recall that in August Kellyanne Conway, John Dowd, and Trump himself all lied in various interviews that Trump had never considered firing Mueller.\n\nTo George Stephanopolpus on August 6th, Conway said “He has not even discussed that... the President has not discussed firing Bob Mueller.”\n\nIn USA Today on the 8th, Dowd: “That’s never been on the table, never ... it’s a manifestation of the media.”\n\nIn response to a gaggle question in Bedminster on the 10th, Trump: “I haven’t given it any thought.”\n\nFucking lying liars. '
'GOP 2016..."We can\'t have a President that is under constant investigation"! Where are these mother fuckers right now?\n\nEdit: Republicans are inventing scandals...this shit is real!'
"Guess who was calling for Mueller to be fired in June?\n\nDing Ding Ding! It's Sean Hannity!\nhttps://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/10/09/study-hannity-s-treatment-trumps-russia-scandal-takes-authoritarian-turn/218177\n"
'Just for those too young or who don\'t understand the details. The first count of Nixon\'s Impeachment Articles was Obstruction of Justice. What most don\'t realize is that the obstruction was for firing Special Counsel Cox.\n\nIf McGahn testified that he refused the order because it was obstruction (since people in the chain of command are allowed to resist illegal orders) then Trump would still be guilty of obstruction. Obstruction does not have to be "successful". It merely had to have been attempted, with purpose.\n\nHere is a detailed timeline\n\n\n1. Nixon orders Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General to fire special counsel Archibald Cox, they refuse and resign.\n2. Nixon orders acting AG Bork to fire Cox, Bork does so (but he too resigns later)\n3. Federal court rules firing Cox was obstruction of justice.\n4. Bipartisan public sentiment for impeachment soars from 22% to 71%.\n5. House Judiciary Committee files three articles of impeachment.\n6. Nixon last seen waving from the steps of Marine One.\n\nPlay it again, Sam.'
'> Trump “claimed that **a dispute years ago over fees at Trump National Golf Club** in Sterling, Va., had prompted Mr. Mueller, the F.B.I. director at the time, to resign his membership.”\n\nOh, for fuck’s sake.'
'Remember the "[documents in McGahn\'s safe](http://www.newsweek.com/russia-investigation-mystery-documents-locked-trump-attorney-safe-668199)" that had some people in the White House freaked out last year?  How much you want to bet, that one of them might be a letter signed by Trump - directing the DOJ to fire Mueller?\n\nMcGahn was given the letter to deliver, refused, threatened to resign, and then hid the note in his safe.'

'Okay, I\'ll post this long thread written by Seth Abramson:\n\n>**(THREAD) BREAKING NEWS (New York Times)**: We now know Trump already tried to fire Special Counsel Mueller—7 months ago. Many believed such an attempt would be a "red line" that would lead to impeachment. So what do we do now? I analyze that question and what this news means here.\n\n>**1/** First, here\'s the NYT story. The upshot is that last June Donald Trump *ordered* White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Special Counsel Bob Mueller. McGahn refused and threatened to quit if Trump went forward with the firing. Ultimately, Trump relented.\n\n>**2/** Some will wonder why McGahn had enough sway with Trump to stop this from happening. That\'s a very good question to ask. First, note that McGahn was the attorney from Trump\'s winning presidential campaign, so the two have known each other and worked together for some time now.\n\n>**3/** Next, we have to remember that McGahn is a potential witness—and, importantly, a potential witness *against Trump*—in the Trump-Russia investigation. McGahn was present at nearly all the key moments in the Obstruction fact-pattern that Mueller is considering referring to DOJ.\n\n>**4/** If Mueller refers an Obstruction indictment to DOJ, DOJ will likely refer it to the House Judiciary Committee for consideration for articles of impeachment—and whether or not such articles come out of that committee, America already knows Obstruction is an impeachable offense.\n\n>**5/** It\'s an impeachable offense because it already was for Bill Clinton—per the Republican Party and its votes on impeachment in the House. So while Trump may only have had an inkling of this last June, he likely knew enough to see that McGahn was someone whose loyalty he needed.\n\n>**6/** McGahn is protected from ever testifying against Donald Trump on some issues—but *not* if the conduct he is to be questioned about involves criminal conduct by the president. Remember that Don McGahn does *not* represent Donald Trump, he represents the Office of the President.\n\n>**7/** Definitionally and legally, criminal conduct is not considered within the recognized duties of a president, which means McGahn\'s role as an attorney for the Office of the President diverges from Trump\'s own legal interests as and when the president has acted illegally—as here.\n\n>**8/** McGahn was present before and after the Comey firing, as Trump concocted pretexts for that illegal action and then—afterward—a coverup for what was a *Russia-based* decision to dump Comey. That decision was illegal for the previously cited reason about the office of president.\n\n>**9/** No constitutional provision or U.S. statute ever has—or ever could—authorize POTUS to commit a crime. This means that while Trump *is* allowed to fire Comey because, say, he doesn\'t like Comey\'s dress sense, he\'s *not* allowed to fire him to obstruct a criminal investigation.\n\n>**10/** So McGahn can rather readily be used as an Obstruction witness against Trump, not just because of the Comey firing but much else—for instance attempts to pressure Congressional investigators to drop their probes or attempts to pressure Jeff Sessions into not recusing himself.\n\n>**11/** Trump was represented by Marc Kasowitz last June, and either Trump or Kasowitz would have sussed out that if Don McGahn quit the White House because he believed Trump was about to commit a *crime*—and make no mistake, that\'d pretty much be the basis—it would be a catastrophe.\n\n>**12/** The firing itself would be a catastrophe politically, but if it occurred concurrent to McGahn quitting, the chances that McGahn would be drawn even further into the investigation as a witness against Trump would be *extremely* high. And we don\'t know what *else* McGahn knows.\n\n>**13/** Here\'s the problem: Trump didn\'t back off from firing Mueller because he decided it was wrong or outside his authority or—better still—a federal crime. \n\n>This is a *critical* point: the NYT establishes Trump *only* relented to keep McGahn from quitting as White House Counsel.\n\n>**14/** Indeed, there wouldn\'t have been any story for the NYT to report—this would likely never have leaked—if Trump had simply gone to McGahn for legal advice about firing Mueller, and McGahn had advised him not to do so, and Trump immediately relented in the face of such advice.\n\n>**15/** Rather, the NYT says that—either on his own counsel or someone else\'s—Donald Trump *ordered* McGahn to do something. He did *not* ask for his advice, he *ordered* him to fire Mueller. (It may have been Kasowitz\'s doing, as Kasowitz was urging Trump to go to war with Mueller.)\n\n>**16/** So what we know now is Trump had the criminal intent—mens rea—to Obstruct by firing his *second* person who was then investigating him, but no crime occurred because there was no actus reus (no act). The only reason there was no act was a key witness threatening to jump ship.\n\n>**17/** So Trump thinks he has the *authority* to fire Mueller, that doing so is *appropriate* and *warranted*, and he has the *willingness* to do so. Also (lest we forget) he has the willingness to *lie* about wanting to fire Mueller—as he\'s now been lying about it for seven months.\n\n>**18/** When many many analysts, me included, were saying after Mueller\'s appointment that he needed to be protected ASAP from Trump firing him—because we said that that attempt *would* be made—such concerns were dismissed as conspiracy theory and the bill to protect Mueller stalled.\n\n>**19/** One effect of this breaking news therefore must be immediate passage of the bill to protect Mueller that was *only* not passed previously because the GOP told America—and they were dead wrong—that this president never had and would never have any intention of firing Mueller.\n\n>**20/** But it\'s more than that: Trump was willing to fire Mueller when his level of legal jeopardy was unclear, and Mueller had brought *no* indictments and secured *no* cooperation deals with top Trump national security aides. So what is Trump\'s temperature on firing Mueller *now*?\n\n>**CONCLUSION/** This is the last moment for Republicans to jump off the Trump ship in the eyes of history. Trump is the Titanic and the iceberg is *dead ahead*. He *will* try to fire Mueller—a crime and impeachable as Obstruction. Congress must get on the right side of history *now*.\n\n>**NOTE/** There are other ancillary effects to this story: for instance, Bill Burck *must* now see that he needs to get the hell off two of the three cases he\'s currently working as attorney: Bannon, McGahn, and Priebus. Representing all three is no longer (really never was) tenable.\n'

'So, a couple of important things. \n\n(1) This is a real slam-dunk move from Mueller - note that they Subpoena\'d the trump *organization* and not Trump personally or specific individuals. This means they will have the co-operation of Trump\'s *own employees* for providing evidence against him. \n\n(2) They very likely *already have* a lot of the documents of importance to the case, so people at Trump org. will be working under threat of indictment for lying to federal investigators if they intentionally fail to produce or destroy evidence for Trump. \n\n(3) This is a files and data case; it sounds like issued subpoenas are for documents, not witnesses - although it could be both, and if Trump has been associating with shady Russian figures for some time then that will show in records obtained from Trump Org. staff. However anything Trump gets charged with based on these financial records is more or less set in stone, there\'s no ambiguity of "he said this" or "he didn\'t say this" from conflicting witness testimony. Everything is on paper, and if he (AND his children) laundered money through Trump org. that will be shown here. \n\nThe question remaining is: What did Mueller request? Without a copy of the Subpoena we have no way of knowing what he\'s asked for. Hopefully it will be publicly available soon and then we will know more.\n\nBUT, the subpoena might list the names of people of interest with ties to the Trump association (since they probably requested all Trump org. e-mails, faxes, financial documents and maybe even phone records that have any ties to those people), and that will give us a much better picture of just how broad the scope of the crimes being investigated is and *who* the major players that we don\'t already know about are. It\'s possible (I dare say likely) Trump has been associating with international criminals for some time and there will undoubtedly be financial documents and communications records about (a) The laundering of money out of Kazakhstan (b) Trump tower Moscow; (c) the Trump Soho allegedly used to launder money that implicates Ivanka; and - probably - a lot of other alleged criminal activities).\n\nOverall, a this is a VERY bad sign for Trump. '

Assuming we don’t all die in a nuclear holocaust, our grandkids are going to ask us in disbelief what it was like during America’s soft civil war. People are going to become niche scholars of this era of politics. Mueller is going to have a fucking biopic about him that will sweep at the Oscars 20 years from now. His name will become synonymous with a cold, unflappable pursuit of justice.\n\n\nThis shit is absolutely wild and if you’re not paying attention you should be.\n'

But I think it\'s also an extremely likely scenario. \n\nWe\'re clearly rushing toward a showdown between the administration and the Special Counsel, and it\'s going to come to a head sooner rather than later. Trump is for sure gearing up for a fight, and given Mueller\'s history (and everything we know about him) he\'s not going to go down/back down silently. And all of us, and a floundering Congress, are going to be stuck in the crosshairs as we implore our government to do their jobs. \n\nBuckle up. It\'s going to be one hell of a ride from here. '

"This bill has widespread bipartisan support.  There is ZERO justification for not letting it come to a vote.  Even if McConnell doesn't personally support the bill, not allowing a bill with this level of support to be brought to the floor is an abdication of his responsibilities, and a violation of the oath he swore to this nation.\n\nOn top of that, his reasoning is batshit insane.  First, we know Trump has tried fire Mueller on AT LEAST TWO OCCASIONS.  So the idea that Trump hasn't given any sign of firing Mueller is objectively false.  Second, the idea that you need to wait for the bill to become necessary before you act is pants-on-head moronic.  You don't put a seatbelt on when you get in an accident.  You put it on when you get in the car, so you are prepared for the worst.  According to this jackass, we're supposed to wait until Trump fires Mueller before worrying about trying to protect him."

"For those of you asking how one person can have the power to do this, in a roundabout way he actually can't.\n\nYes, Mitch McConnell is the majority leader and can block bills from coming to the floor, but there _are_ levers in place that could force his hand. The Senate Republican Caucus, composed of Republican Senators, could remove him or threaten to remove him whenever they want. They could install a new Senate leader who would bring the bill to the floor.\n\nIt's similar to President Trump's seemingly unchecked power; there are ways that other members of our government (the rest of GOP) can and should intervene, but they are choosing not to. They aren't at Trump's or McConnell's mercy. They're letting it look that way so they can do the shitty thing and avoid taking the heat for it.\n\nDon't blame it all on McConnell.

'What a piece of shit. Fuck this guy.'
">“Just as a practical matter, even if we pass it, why would he sign it?” McConnell said in the Fox interview.\n\nThat's what the fucking balances of power is for. He can always veto it - and you can pass it with a super majority. Just throwing your hands up and going 'aww shucks' is abdication of duty! Do your fucking job.\n\n>Others said it’s simply not good politics to try and tell Trump what to do, likening the legislation to “poking the bear.”\n\nYou hear a lot of domestic abuse victims saying the same thing instead of getting out or speaking up.

"McConnell before firing: He hasn't fired him yet, it's unnecessary!\n\nMcConnell after firing: Too late now! No use crying over spilled milk!"
'I am probably going to regret saying this, and I really, really hate feeling this way, but... can we trade McCain for McConnell?\n\n\nI think you all know what I mean.'
'I\'ve been an American for all 33 years of my life and I still have no idea how Congress works.  Why does one old turtle have so much power over our lawmaking?  Why can\'t the other members of Congress vote regardless of what neck waddles wants?  It seems insane to me that we as a country who prides ourself on democracy and "one voice one vote" has a system in place where a geriatric Nazi gets to hold our legislation hostage.'
'Call me crazy but this is a hell of a coincidence.  Remember Trump saying, ["Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing"](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html)?  That was July 27, 2016.\n\nNow look at this line on pages 7-8 of the indictment:\n\n> For example, on or about **July 27, 2016**, the Conspirators attempted after hours to spearphish **for the first time** email accounts at a domain hosted by a third-party provider and used by Clinton\'s personal office.  At or around the same time, they also targeted seventy-six email addresses at the domain for the Clinton Campaign.\n\n*edit: belated typo fix*'
'Here\'s a buried lede in the indictments:  \n  \n[Link](https://twitter.com/peterjhasson/status/1017805935400706052):  \n  \n>On or about August 15, 2016, the Conspirators, posing as Guccifer 2.0, received a request for stolen documents from a candidate for the US Congress. The Conspirators responded using the Guccifer 2.0 persona and sent the candidate stolen documents related to the candidate\'s opponent.  \n  \nThere\'s your fucking collusion.  \n  \nedit: My guess is [Matt Gaetz](https://mobile.twitter.com/RVAwonk/status/1017539605132906497), the most vocal in calling for Trump to fire Mueller. Gaetz is also buddy-buddy with Roger Stone.  \n  \nedit 2: Appears Ron DeSantis used some as well, see comment from user aafarensis with the link. Also, [this WSJ story from 2017:](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-alleged-russian-hacker-teamed-up-with-florida-gop-operative-1495724787) "How Alleged Russian Hacker Teamed Up With Florida GOP Operative"  \n  \n>The hacking spree that upended the presidential election wasn’t limited to Democratic National Committee memos and Clinton-aide emails posted on websites. The hacker also privately sent Democratic voter-turnout analyses to a Republican political operative in Florida named Aaron Nevins.  \n  \nSo connecting dots here: Guccifer (Russians) hack DCCC/DNC info in Florida. Roger Stone acts as POC for Guccifer, and has them give the info to Nevins. Nevins then distributes the hacked documents to DeSantis and Gaetz. My guess is that Gaetz is the one mentioned in the indictment given it says "candidate" not "incumbent" or "sitting Congressman".'
"Few quick notes : \n\n[Here's the actual indictment](https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download)\n\n\n* Guccifer 2.0/DCleaks (which Roger Stone and Wikileaks were in communication with. )\n\n* It confirms the effort (and those aliases) were directly tied to GRU and the Russian government.\n\n* The indictments mention Wikileaks as an unnamed group(not yet indicted) used for timing and distribution of the hacked information for maximum effect \n\n* The indictments mention communications with Stone as an unnamed person (not yet indicted) whom provided extensive feedback on the hacked materials. \n\n* The indictments mention distribution of hacked material to an unnamed state lobbyist/online source of political news (not sure who this is yet, might be [this guy](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-alleged-russian-hacker-teamed-up-with-florida-gop-operative-1495724787), but I'm not sure)\n\n* The indictment mentions an unnamed Congressional candidate who had sought and received material. (not sure who this is yet)  [People seem to think this is Brian Mast,](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/gop-operative-russian-hacker-gave-him-2016-voter-data) we'll see if that gets confirmed. Nevins may have assisted all Florida GOP members, its possible someone outside of Florida directly asked themselves. \n\n\n* The indictment mentions GRU working with journalist looking for dirt on Black Lives Matter. (Someone from Breitbart?, Fox? some obvious suspects there) This appears to be Breitbart/Sputnik journalist Lee Stranahan. \n\n\n\n* **The indictment mentions targeted attacks on July 27, 2016 directed at the Clinton campaign and Clinton's personal office. What else happened that day? [Trump publicly asked Russia to hack Clinton](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/trump-putin-no-relationship-226282) .** Fun coincidence huh? \n\n* The indictment, much like the last one of the Russians doesn't try to assess whether or not they had an impact on the election results. It is a specific, isolated slice as it has been every time. \n\n\n* This now means Mueller has charged 32 people 3 companies and has gotten 5 guilty pleas in a little over a year. Involving both Trump officials (whom were all charged with crimes in one way or another related to Russia) or people tied to the Russian government. \n\nThis witch hunt is finding an awful lot of witches.\n\nThis comes off the back of a joke of a hearing yesterday where the House GOP attacked and tried to discredit one of the lead FBI agents on the FBI investigation into this and also Trump meets with Putin in a few days. Quite the contrast.\n\n\nI'll edit this if I think of anything else of note/see anyone else notice anything. And if people have questions, feel free to ask. \n"

This is huge.\n\n"Russia, if you\'re listening..."\n\nApparently, they very much were.\n\nEDIT: Wikileaks also clearly involved as a puppet of the GRU, although Rosenstein is not identifying them by name - merely refers to "another group" that was funnelled DNC documents to be released to the public.\n\nEDIT: Just so there\'s no misunderstanding: the GRU is an official intelligence organ of the Russian government. This was a state-sponsored attack on the electoral system of the United States. The timing of this - two days before Trump has a private meeting with Putin - cannot be an accident. Were I a total conspiracy theorist, I would wonder if the DoJ is setting a trap for their own President...\n\nEDIT: Trump was informed earlier in the week and is fully aware of the indictments being made today despite being overseas.\n\nEDIT: In Q&A, Rosenstein makes it clear that the timing of these indictments relative to Trump\'s meeting with Putin is coincidental. Conspiracy theorists, stand down :)\n\nEDIT: In Q&A, Rosenstein declines to speculate as to whether GRU attempts to influence the election were actually _successful_ - these indictments merely allege that they _attempted_ it.\n\nEDIT: In Q&A, Rosenstein elegantly side-steps a question as to whether Trump approved of the indictments :) \n\n"I\'ll let the President speak for himself" lol\n\nLet me guess, it\'s still a witch-hunt, amirite? :)\n\nEDIT: Oh my god, he actually did call it a witch-hunt again. Earlier today at Chequers (remember, he knew about these indictments in advance). Unbelievable.\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/hours-after-bashing-british-leader-may-trump-praises-her-n891131\n\n> He also said the investigation into his 2016 campaign\'s ties to Russia is harmful to the U.S., particularly as he aims to form a better relationship with President Vladimir Putin when the two meet in Helsinki Monday.\n\n> "I think that we\'re being hurt very badly by the — I would call it \'the witch hunt.\' I would call it \'the rigged witch hunt,\'" he said of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\'s probe. "I think that really hurts our country and it really hurts our relationship with Russia. I think that we would have a chance to have a very good relationship with Russia."\n\n> Trump said "yes" when asked whether he would tell Putin not to meddle in American elections ...'
'Rosenstein: "I briefed President Trump earlier this week."\n\nTrump this AM: "The DOJ investigation is a witchhunt!"\n\nRosenstein: "The Russians are attacking us."\n\nTrump: "The DOJ is attacking us!" '
'Fox just cut off a congressman who said this made Trump look guilty. \n\nNow they are covering Lisa Page and starting the fire Rosenstien dogwistles'
"Someday when this is a film, this scene will be intercut with Trump sitting down to tea with the Queen.  As he raises the teacup to his gross lips, the scene will cut to Rod Rosenstein announcing the indictment of twelve Russian spies.

'Please humor me in engaging in a tactic called *reflection*. We know there are Russian agents on here, usually low level Russians needing cash (what with the economic depression and sanctions, Russia isn\'t doing so hot), so here\'s how you get through to them:\n\nWhenever you suspect they may be from Russia, insert some information that Russian citizens don\'t normally see. Use it as a backdoor *back into* Russia. Eventually the higher-ups won\'t like what their workers see. Eventually, it might start swaying Russians.\n\nRemember, don\'t take fault in the Russian citizens—I personally admire them and their stoicism—strictly recognize the state actors who manipulate them. \n\nSo with that, let\'s talk about Russia, the Oligarchy, and Putin:\n\nIt really is par for the course for Putin.

'We should be worried about this threat to our entire democracy. Instead, we are arguing amongst each other and playing right into their hands. This is pathetic. Look at what Rosenstein said,\n\n“When we confront foreign interference in American elections, it is important for us to avoid thinking politically as Republicans or Democrats and instead to think patriotically as Americans. Our response must not depend on who was victimized,” he said. “There will always be adversaries who work to exacerbate domestic differences and try to confuse, divide, and conquer us. So long as we are united in our commitment to the values enshrined in the Constitution, they will not succeed.”\n\nAllowing ourselves to further this schism in our country is foolish.'
'"On or about August 15, 2016, the Conspirators, posing as Guccifer 2.0, received a request for stolen documents from a candidate for U.S. Congress.

'I don\'t think it makes sense to say "if Trump crosses X line" we impeach. There is no moral line he will not cross to glorify himself.\n\n\nLook at the lines he has already crossed: \n\n\n1. Obstructed justice by asking Comey to "let go" of Flynn investigation.\n2. Fired Comey thinking it would end the total investigation.\n3. Held private meeting with Russians, where American media was banned, but Russian media allowed. Spoon fed top secret classified information to Russians at this meeting.\n4. .... any many more things.\n\nWe must impeach now. The rules governing a special counsel puts Mueller FAR, FAR outside Trump\'s reach in firing.  If Trump could, he would have fired him by now. \n'
'> If Trump fires Mueller, as many now speculate is possible, the United States will find itself in a constitutional crisis—where the executive branch rejects scrutiny, checks and balances, and the rule of law in order to protect itself from accountability. \n\nI agree with what they’re saying, and thought it can get much worse, the crisis has been here since the beginning of Trumps presidency. \n\nTrump has rejected EVERY SINGLE piece of scrutiny that was thrown his way. In Trumps mind,he’s done literally nothing wrong and everything right. He’s waged a war on the press, he’s attacked courts, judges, intelligence agencies and our entire system of checks and balances. He’s threatened and attempted to obstruct the methods of checks and balances. Trump doesn’t understand what any of those things are for, and since Trump can do no wrong in his mind, they’re a bunch of biased, time and money wasters, out to get him. Unfortunately many of his millions of supporters also don’t understand how these things, like checks and balances, are supposed to work, why they’re in place, .etc look to Trump to form their opinions and world views. \n\nSo yes, it’s already crisis. Trump could rally support for the most insane, illegal actions if he wanted. It doesn’t help that they’re also short-sighted and aren’t thinking about precedent. Trump isn’t going to be the last president we ever have (unless we get nuked to nothing), so what about the next time a (D) president they despise comes around. If they start pulling the same shit, these republicans better realize it’s on them. But I know they won’t. '
'https://twitter.com/maddow/status/941812414487478273\n\nSome people are hypothesizing this will be the downfall of Rosenstein, which means Mueller could be in jeopardy. A lot of what-if\'s... But consider the news from the last 24 hours. \n\nGowdy saying McCabe won\'t be around next week, Trump saying they are going to "rebuild" the FBI, increased rhetoric from right wing media (esp. Fox) amping up support for Mueller firing, some unsubstantiated rumors of a Kushner indictment (plus his hiring of a crisis management firm), & the revelation that Cambridge Analytica turned over documents to Mueller months ago.'

"There's a lot of talk about how Mueller's team had these e-mails for a long time and used the contents to inform the scripts they produced for questioning witnesses and everyone is giggling to themselves.  Folks...this is the most incompetent and quite frankly DUMB criminal conspiracy in the history of the United States. These guys were literally committing crimes against the United States through e-mail, Facebook messenger and apps on their phone.  This isn't some Mr. Robot 256bit encryption PGP shit.  It's literally a bunch of completely NON-technical savvy people leaving so many fingerprints and audit trails that its actually BAD for Mueller because he has to hire more staff to sift through all the nonsense.

For he will likely obtain this information—**a giant risk to [the bank’s] reputation**.”\n\nInterpretation: why this is more damaging than rest of DB irregularities - perhaps because Trump related collusion would get **mass media coverage** (and tabloid level - reaching everyone) - contrast this with usual bank irregularities which stay relegated to financial press (and a day or two as top news).  Add to that a prolonged trial and steady leaks about Mueller investigation, and DB name would the subject of real and imagined speculation for weeks.\n\nOriginal news report (German):\n\n- [Deutsche Bank findet Hinweise auf zweifelhafte Geschäfte von Trumps Schwiegersohn Kushner](http://www.manager-magazin.de/unternehmen/banken/deutsche-bank-meldet-zwielichtige-geschaefte-von-jared-kushner-a-1188345.html)\n\n-----\n\nOther coverage:\n\n- [Jared Kushner’s Firm Tied to “Suspicious Transactions” at German Bank](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/01/deutsche-bank-reports-suspicious-activity-related-to-jared-kushners-accounts-1/)\n\n>The bank is, by far, **Trump’s largest creditor**, having lent him more than $300 million in recent years through it’s private bank ..\n>\n>The Trumps and Kushners relationship to Deutsche Bank is a particularly large conflict of interest, given **the bank’s history of clashing with regulators**—it has made several multi-billion dollar settlements with regulators in the US and Europe for its role in the LIBOR-rigging scandal and the 2008 mortgage crisis. It continues to be under investigation for its role in a possible money-laundering scheme that helped Russians evade sanctions and move money out of that country. \n\n- [How money laundering works in real estate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/01/04/how-money-laundering-works-in-real-estate/?utm_term=.93be9c94fe0c)\n\n>“You realize where this is going,” **Bannon reportedly told Wolff. “This is all about money laundering**. Mueller chose Weissmann first and he is a money-laundering guy. Their path to f—ing Trump goes right through Paul Manafort, Don Jr and Jared Kushner. … It goes through Deutsche Bank and all the Kushner s—-.”\n\n----\n'

"> It’s unclear whether Mueller’s investigators also have evidence that Cohen actually met with a prominent Russian – purportedly Konstantin Kosachev, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin — in the Czech capital. Kosachev, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee of a body of the Russian legislature, the Federation Council, also has denied visiting Prague during 2016. Earlier this month, Kosachev was among 24 high-profile Russians hit with stiff U.S. sanctions in retaliation for Russia’s meddling.\n\n> But investigators have traced evidence that Cohen entered the Czech Republic through Germany, apparently during August or early September of 2016 as the ex-spy reported, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is confidential. He wouldn’t have needed a passport for such a trip, because both countries are in the so-called Schengen Area in which 26 nations operate with open borders. The disclosure still left a puzzle: The sources did not say whether Cohen took a commercial flight or private jet to Europe, and gave no explanation as to why no record of such a trip has surfaced.\n\n> Cohen has vehemently denied for months that he ever has been in Prague or colluded with Russia during the campaign. Neither he nor his lawyer responded to requests for comment for this story.\n\nHe wouldn't vehemently deny it if he was there for something banal.  If they have evidence he was there, that's going to be extremely difficult for Cohen *and* Trump to explain.  Shit is *really* going to start hitting the fan soon.  Very soon.\n\n> Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller’s office, declined comment."

"**Remember** \n  \n  \nPrior to this, **only** George Nader received immunity for testimony. This is big and we are going to learn a lot over the next few days.

'Okay, there\'s a crucial detail about Manafort and the general direction of the special counsel that I see ignored here, on Twitter, and in media coverage:  \n  \nManafort was done the minute Gates pleaded guilty. Signed, sealed, delivered. Gates is the major witness in this case and will sink Manafort completely. Ballgame.  \n  \nBy extension, Gates cooperating is the largest fish that could have been netted short of someone like Manafort himself, Kushner, Stone, Don Jr., Ivanka, or Eric pleading guilty. Gates was also deputy campaign chair, stayed on after Manafort left the campaign, AND helped manage the inauguration, which is another one of Mueller\'s subject areas.  \n  \nGates has as many bodies to unearth as Cohen does. At least on the campaign/GOP/political side. I don\'t understand why people don\'t include this in their takes on the Manafort case and the special counsel as a whole. Gates ain\'t exactly Moby Dick, but Mueller certainly reeled in a nice Mahi Mahi or Blue Marlin with Gates.  \n  \n~~I guarantee Gates is one of these that\'s being given immunity.~~ He should be the star witness for the prosecution. And strangely, I haven\'t noticed efforts to discredit him by Trump or Paulie Walnuts.  \n  \nAnd for those saying it\'s a witch hunt, they blatantly ignore Gates\' plea deal and his position under Trump.  \n  \nedit: I now realize these are previously "unknown" witnesses'

"Do we need another front page post to remind us of [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7t12e6/trump_ordered_mueller_fired_but_backed_off_when/) from January, with basically the same headline, that had almost 95,000 Upvotes? \n\nIs the collective memory of reddit only four months old?\n\nWhy are we bringing it up *again*? What's the purpose of rehashing literal old-news? \n\nJan. 25, 2018:\n\n>After receiving the president’s order to fire Mr. Mueller, the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, refused to ask the Justice Department to dismiss the special counsel, saying he would quit instead\n\nApril 8, 2018:\n\n>. . .White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, threatened to quit unless Mr. Trump stopped trying to get him to fire Mr. Mueller.\n\nI guess that's just *the way the news goes.*"
'If the AG or deputy AG were fired and their replacement fired Mueller, how is that person not also obstructing justice?  The conflicts of interest the president tried to bring up about mueller previously were laughable. There is no reason to fire him other than to stop the investigation. Is it possible that Trump won’t find anyone that will do it because anyone that does knows they will be opening themselves up to an obstructing justice charge?'
"If he was going to fire him, he'd have done it. He didn't really hesitate to fire Comey at just about the worst timing possible. The reason why he felt he could was because he felt he could go based on others' recommendations (to try and lay it off as not really HIS decision), and there's no way anyone would seriously recommend him to fire Mueller. I think he's found his limit on optics and realizes firing Mueller will do the opposite of making this go away.\n\nIt won't stop him from bitching about what's going on, and essentially try to discredit it all as a witchhunt, which in the end won't really help himself in any way, but it should be obvious by now even to him that firing him would hurt himself much more than helping himself."
'But I thought Trump told us that he was certain the investigation would be done before 2018? Why would he need to fire him if he thought the investigation was finishing?\n\n\nOh, right.  Senile sack of lying shit.'

'The real headline is "Poll: 18 percent of dumb mother fuckers think Trump shouldn\'t testify under oath to Mueller."'
"Really doesn't matter. Under oath or simply an interview with Mueller, it is illegal to lie. He'll fuck up regardless of the setting."
"If he is innocent the investigation will prove it. He shouldn't have anything to worry about. Nixon ordered the break in to the DNC because he feared they held evidence of his treason. He did everything he could to stop or smear the investigation. Donald Trump is exhibiting the same behavior history has told us a President guilty of treason commits. The American people deserve to follow Robert Mueller's investigation to its conclusive end and accept the results, whether guilty or innocence. Any politician unwilling to pass a law to protect Mueller is complicit in obstruction of justice.  "
"Of course he should\n\nEither he'll be an idiot and actually lie under oath, or he'll be an idiot and *tell the truth*. "
'What the fuck is going on with the other 18%?\n\n"He\'s guilty as fuck, but sometimes you have to break the law to do what\'s right." And of course, in other words they really mean "You need to break the law to fuck the parts of the constitution we don\'t like"\n\nAs for the other 82% - it\'s comprised of "Yeah, I want him to get busted" and "He has nothing to hide!" and "I\'d like to see exactly how far this goes."'
"What is the point of being under oath when the man doesn't respect the constitution, the law nor does he respect the truth.  It's meaningless to him."
'Trump and the GOP are of course largely at fault, but I am so enraged that there were no safeguards put into place. If it simply boils down to who holds allegiance to who how are we any further along than the Greeks or Romans? I fear there is no form of government free from corruption and powerlust for humans. '
'There is zero chance of this happening. Trump is dumb enough to do it but his lawyers would never allow it. With the way he talks and lies he’d be walking into a perjury trap. '
"Shouldn't we be really concerned about the other 18 percent who don't have any faith in the Russian investigation OR in the lawful legal process? \n\nEDIT: If Trump has nothing to hide, his supporters should have no problem letting him testify. Unless they also know he's a bumbling idiot who might put himself in a hole given a chance."

"TLDR: Manafort and Gates laundered about 33 million dollars of Putin connected cash coming from their work with Yanukovych starting around 2006. \n\nThat's bad, but here's the kicker.

"I would like to stop and appreciate for a moment the absolute freak out shit show that the Trump cult would be doing if instead of Manafort, this was Hillary's campaign manager. \n\nOr hell, if it was someone she once walked past on her way to the store and nodded slightly at. \n\nThinking about that...imagine if this had come out during the campaign. "
'Bloody hell. 32 new charges. No wonder Gates has changed his mind on fighting this in court. '
"This will terrify Trump. For three reasons:\n\n* a) it shows Mueller is not only looking directly at the election conspiracy but also at financial irregularity and historical money laundering by people connected to the campaign. Mueller has very detailed bank and offshore company transactions going back to 2008. And he's indicting for tax avoidance. If he is digging into Trump's/Kushner's finances in the same way, there will be a ton of shit to be found. There was a reason Trump never released his tax returns. \n\n* b) Mueller is likely zeroing in a ways that money might have been flowing from Russia into the Trump campaign. According to the indictment, Manafort and Gates were laundering money while working for the Trump campaign. It's worth noting Manafort was working for Trump *for free*.\n\n* c) Trump will realize that Manafort and Gates are completely screwed and they will now be highly motivated to plea deal. Trump will likely be very worried what they say. \n\nWe can expect more and more erratic behaviour and lashing out from President in the coming weeks. He will be feeling the noose tightening and there's isn't much he can about it.  And if the GOP and NRA are implicated, expect a concerted desperate political effort to bury the investigation once and for all. "
'>In total, more than $75,000,000 flowed through the offshore accounts. Manafort, with the assistance of Gates, laundered more than $30,000,000, income that he concealed from the US[...] Gates obtained more than $3,000,000 from the offshore accounts\n\nGates ruined his entire life for a measly 10% cut. Pathetic. '
'>The pressure on Manafort heightened further in a court filing unsealed on Feb. 16. Prosecutors said in the document that he engaged in a “series of bank frauds and bank fraud conspiracies” not charged in his indictment. Those frauds relate to a mortgage on a Virginia property that Manafort seeks to pledge to secure his $10 million bail, according to the filing.\n\nSo does that mean he goes to jail now?'
"Page 22...\n\n>Later, on January 26, 2016, MANAFORT wrote to his son-in-law to advise him that when the bank appraiser came to assess the condominium, his  son-in-law  should “[r]emember, he believes that you and [MANAFORT’s daughter] are living there.”\n\nIf Manafort's son-in-law did say that to the appraiser, but it wasn't true they were living there, wouldn't that wrap the son-in-law into some kind of fraud charge???\n\nI guess the appraiser could have not asked or something, but that reads like Manafort's family were in on it..."
"The comments on Fox News are HILARIOUS.\n\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/02/22/special-counsel-files-new-tax-charges-against-manafort-gates.html\n\n> What gave Mueller probable cause to dig up these taxes that were completely unrelated to the original allegations?\n\n\n\n> Robert Mueller is as honest and trustworthy as James Comey.  Or Andrew McCabe.  Or Barack Obama.\n\n\n\n> At this rate it's going to cost more millions for the investigation than the amount of millions that were found to be not filed. Way to be cost efficient, Mueller.\n\n\n\n> I “might have” said I made $70k in order to secure a loan for an extension on my home in 2014.  I really made $50k, but the loan is totally paid off now... does that mean Mueller is coming after me next??  I’m nervous!\n\n\n\n> How about Hillary?

"Imagine being a teenager.  While at a friend's over the weekend, you get a call from your Mom asking her if she can borrow a pen from your backpack.  You agree and tell her your pens are in the front pouch of your backpack.  You come home to find your Mom and Dad on the porch to confront you over the weed they found in your backpack while searching for the pen.  Instead of take responsibility, you throw a tantrum over your parents looking into the wrong section your backpack without permission, and storm off cursing obscenities and threatening to file a lawsuit.\n\nThat's Paul Manafort and his lawyers right now."
'Manafort is desperately looking for an out without having to flip. Rick Gates is going to flip on him. He will soon be faced with the decision to flip on trump & company or go to prison for life. '
"Probably because... It's lawful.  And it should be investigated.\n\nDuring a dinner at the White House on Jan. 27, 2017, Trump asked for a pledge of “loyalty” from James Comey, then the F.B.I. director, who was overseeing the investigation of the Trump campaign.\n\nOn Feb. 14, Trump directed several other officials to leave the Oval Office so he could speak privately with Comey. He then told Comey to “let this go,” referring to the investigation of Michael Flynn, who had resigned the previous day as Trump’s national security adviser.\n\nOn March 22, Trump directed several other officials to leave a White House briefing so he could speak privately with Daniel Coats, the director of national intelligence, and Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director. Trump asked them to persuade Comey to back off investigating Flynn.\n\nIn March and April, Trump told Comey in phone calls that he wanted Comey to lift the ”cloud” of the investigation.\n\nOn May 9, Trump fired Comey as F.B.I. director. On May 10, Trump told Russian officials that the firing had “taken off” the “great pressure” of the Russia investigation. On May 11, he told NBC News that the firing was because of “this Russia thing.”\n\nOn May 17, shortly after hearing that the Justice Department had appointed Mueller to take over the Russia investigation, Trump berated Jeff Sessions, the attorney general. The appointment had caused the administration again to lose control over the investigation, and Trump accused Sessions of “disloyalty.”\n\nIn June, Trump explored several options to retake control. At one point, he ordered the firing of Mueller, before the White House counsel resisted.\n\nOn July 8, aboard Air Force One, Trump helped draft a false public statement for his son, Donald Trump Jr. The statement claimed that a 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer was about adoption policy. Trump Jr. later acknowledged that the meeting was to discuss damaging information the Russian government had about Hillary Clinton.\n\nOn July 26, in a tweet, Trump called for the firing of Andrew McCabe, the F.B.I.’s deputy director, a potential corroborating witness for Comey’s conversations with Trump. The tweet was part of Trump’s efforts, discussed with White House aides, to discredit F.B.I. officials.\n\nThroughout, Trump (and this quotation comes from the Nixon article of impeachment) “made false or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the United States.” Among other things, Trump repeatedly made untruthful statements about American intelligence agencies’ conclusions regarding Russia’s role in the 2016 election."
"This burning wreck is taking far longer to crash than I'd like. \n\n\nIt's so fucking nervewracking. Every day that goes by before we inevitably jail or execute these traitors does more damage to the nation."
'This memo and the pathetic attempt by the GOP to discredit the investigation was the nail in the coffin for them, they  fucked up so bad.\n\n '
'It seems that the GOP has learned the worst possible lesson from Trump’s campaign and presidency: that for a large portion of the country, consistency in your options and attitudes and values does not matter at all. That you can say one thing one day, and say the exact opposite the next day, and the base simply doesn’t care. \n\nI’ve always been far more worried about the long-term effect of a Trump presidency than any one particular thing he might do . . . that his utter contempt for the office and for a political tradition that at least pretended to have some respect for the notion of integrity would damage or destroy the foundational fiction that we’ve been maintaining for decades: that words have meaning, and ideas should be consistent. \n\nI think people on both sides have recognized that this is largely a fiction, and that voters have been hoping for someone to throw back the curtain and reset the system to try and recapture some of those values. \n\nBut what has happened is that, yeah, the curtain is pulled and everyone is seeing a certain amount of the man behind it according to their views, but Trump has taken the seat for himself and is wallowing in the filth and actively making it worse. \n\nIn truth this is all of our fault for being at least a little tribal. For not thinking about how powers can be abused when the other team is in charge before we grant increases of power to the executive branch. And this started at least a couple of generations ago when congress gave up the right and responsibility to declare war and handing that power directly to the president, and we (not literally we—most of us weren’t born at the time.) didn’t do anything because it was for a good cause.\n\nWe didn’t care when Clinton went and started bombing other countries to distract the public from his scandals. Or when he used executive orders to de facto create legislation. We didn’t care about Obama abusing FISA counts, illegal mass surveillance, or using a military drone against a U.S. citizen on our own soil. And now we have a crazy person vested with all of these powers that no president should ever have had, regardless of how good the cause was or how evil someone else is. \n\nI’m not saying this to say that both sides are equally guilty. But rather because we all know that it’s fairly impossible to have a reasonable debate with the Trump dumpsters. So we have to have that debate amomst ourselves. \n\nWe have to have blue victories in mid terms. We have to stop this train wreck. But then we also have to go after the Democrats we support to roll back the worst of these changes, take responsibility for doing their jobs, and not get fooled into complacency just because it’s our team that wants to grab more powers. \n\nI know that’s in the future, but we need to push for this as soon as some level of sanity gets restored before people get too comfortable and the memory of how bad things can get starts to fade. \n\nIf we’re not able to understand our role in how we got to where we are now, this is going to continue to happen'
"When the motion attacking the investigation gets denied, it's time for Manafort to flip."
'I think we should cut Manaford some slack. I mean the guy is either going to die in prison or he’s going to die from polonium. \n\nNot saying he dun deserve it. He has no good options. But then again, he shoulda seen this coming doing all those inhumane things in his past. Deal with the devil.'
"What exactly is going on with the comments in r/politics? All of a sudden we're seeing pro-Trump propaganda and talking points everywhere. It's becoming unwieldy to wade through (none of it deserves a response, obviously) and it just ruins discussion when we're trying to engage with reality and the news and they're just popping in on vacation from Fantasyland.\n\nIf any of them see this: yes, we don't want to talk to you or see your bullshit. No, that doesn't mean we can't  argue with you. It means we've given up because of what you have shown us- you don't care about the truth, you don't have anything intelligent or insightful to say, and you don't deserve us engaging with you. "

We need to fire every single useless anchor they currently have and replace them with men and women who know how to call the GOP and their talking heads out on their lies and treason. \n\nI\'m sick and tired of seeing MSNBC, CNN etc allows these people to come on a lie to us while their anchors stutter and stumble around to call these people out. \n\nIf they had any brains they would have just done show after show of them laughing at this memo, while explaining how it shows that Trump\'s campaign manager Carter Page is a proven American turncoat who has admitted to being turned into a Russian spy. Go ahead assholes, lets watch you scumbags answer:\n\n>"So tell us again why it\'s important for the Republicans and President Trump to defend an admitted traitor to the United States of America? Why are you and your party defending Trump campaign manager Carter Page\'s treason with this memo? When did Donald Trump learn that Carter Page was a traitor and Russia Spy?"\n\nInstead we\'ve got the WORST anchors with zero guts getting roasted each night, "thanks for coming on!", and Elon Musk planning his escape to Mars or underground to live with the mole people.'

'You sound like you’re losing your shit over this.\n\nThere IS evidence that Russia interfered with our elections. There is also evidence that Trump met with Russians about “adoptions”. This is code for lifting sanctions. Trump asked Russia live on TV to hack the DNC, and they did.\n\nIt may be impossible to verify 100% of the dossier, but 80% of it is believed to be true. The dossier is a map of where to look. The investigation is looking into whether or not Trump obstructed justice by trying to derail the investigation.\n\nSo, if your argument is that we can’t prove that the dossier is 100% verifiable, then you’re in for a rude awakening. This isn’t about the dossier completely. This is about Trumps actions to derail the investigation. This is about what he knew and when, of Flynn and Manafort’s actions in regards to working with Russia while Russia was trying to hurt Hillary and sway our election. The investigation is also likely to reveal Trump’s shady business dealings with Russian mafia and money laundering.'

'I noticed last week that my Youtube feed was starting to be filled with a lot of anti-left videos. You know, videos like, "Watch this free speech advocate destroy some SJW\'s." I have not actively sought out videos like these at all and yet my youtube recommendations have a bunch of them now.\n\nOne of the big reasons myself, and I believe a lot of other people were so unexcited about Hillary Clinton was this flood of youtube vidoes that ended up on my recommended list about SJW\'s and the like and acting stupid.\n\nbut it gets weirder. Follow me down the rabbit hole. A few days ago there was a video link on the front page to a video about 3 southern guys talking about sex. When I watched the video this immediately filled my recommendations with anti-SJW videos. What if that video was placed on the front page with bots to get anti-SJW videos on people\'s Youtube play list.\n\nbut, even further down the rabbit hole, I wonder how many of these protestors I have seen on videos who do nothing but act like assholes are being payed by Russian influences or being manipulated by Russian influences.\n\nThis whole thing is so scary. The internet has been corrupted. I can see the forest through the trees now. This exact same type of thing happens in Russia before elections. Start showing endless videos that make you dislike the left and vote for the right. You might even start seeing more and more patriotic movies on tv. This is a common Russian trick. Just stay vigilant. Very weird. '

'People need to know that it wasn\'t Mueller that decided on the raid on Cohen yesterday.  The decision maker on the raid was Geoffrey Berman, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York.  Mueller simply "referred" the evidence to Geoffrey Berman\'s office.  \n\nGeoffrey Berman [donated $5400 to Trump\'s campaign](http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/371309-trumps-pick-for-ny-prosecutor-scrutinized). Not only did Trump pick Berman, but [Trump also personally interviewed Berman](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/19/politics/trump-us-attorney-interviews/index.html) before hiring him.

"Way past time.  I think the GOP still think Trump won't do it though, and they see political risks in pushing this through, not to mention that it would only piss Trump off more.\n\nThat said, I really think the Republicans are playing with fire on this; it's going to be a political disaster for their party as a whole if Trump does fire Mueller/Rosenstein/Sessions."
'Republicans want Mueller fired, they just don\'t want to say it out loud. Once Trump has fired Mueller they\'ll find a way to either shut down the investigation or to appoint somebody who\'ll be tasked with "damage control" (aka throw out as much charges and evidence as they can).'
'Really? Not like months ago?!?!?!?\nBullshit!!'
'It is so screwed up that if Trump was a Dem the GOP would be screaming their heads off for impeachment and jail time for him and most his cabinet. Nor would the let a single thing go brining it up for years and years.'
'Protection from what? Being fired? Can I get that too?'
"I don't understand why they wouldn't support this... it would help them avoid the pickle they'd be in if Mueller was fired and the media and Democrats began demanding impeachment."
'I’ve called the offices of Hatch (didn’t answer) Lee and Governor Herbert, as well as my personal congresswoman, Mia Love, and asked them the following questions.\n\nDoes x support, or plan to introduce legislation protecting the special counsel Robert Mueller from being fired ala a Saturday Night massacre scenario? Will x support or enact impeachment proceedings against the president if the special counsel, Rod Rosenstein, or Jeff Sessions is fired in the scenario above? And if not, what is the justification of keeping Trump in office, over Mike Pence, someone conservatives praise and respect? \n\nTheir responses:\n\nLove: She is monitoring the situation closely, but has made no statement.\n\n“Why has she made no statements on this serious matter?”\n\nLove: I don’t have an answer right now\n\nLee: The Senator is for the investigation and has expressed support for Mueller, but he hasn’t made any statements regarding legislation.\n\nI was transferred to Herbert’s personal email and asked the question above, I’m awaiting response from either him or a member of his team.\n\nCall your senators, governors, ask them these tough questions. Don’t allow our politicians to avoid this responsibility to remain silent while the American people remain terrified and anxious over this presidency. Silence is complacency and we should not stand for it.'
'The GOP won’t. Every reasonable person knows this. They are are either complicit, or just don’t want to take part in something they know is going to damage their party.\n\nThe *only* solution is to vote these fuckers out, and replace them with dems.'

'Flynn colluded with Turkey to kidnap a Turkish dissident and send him to back to Erdogan where the dissident will be executed. Not to mention the fact that **while he was National Security Advisor** he was still receiving money from the Turkish government (which he failed to disclose) and vetoed a raid on ISIS that would have hurt Turkey.'
'Somewhere, Flynn is pacing back and forth in a dingy hotel room wearing nothing but a wifebeater and boxer shorts, and just repeating "oh man, this is bad, this is bad, man" to his drinking buddy in the corner.  '

"I don't even think Trump is fazed by any of this. A person with severe narcissistic tendencies will never ever admit they fucked up. Trump considers this all to be a hoax because he makes the rules in his head. He'll also use ANYONE around him as sacrificial lambs. He'd throw Ivanka under the bus if it came down to him looking bad. Flynn, Manafort, Carter Page, or Papapa are all just pawns to him. He'll knock them off the board without even thinking twice. I have no empathy for these people either. They sold their soul to the devil and now it's coming back to bite them in the ass."

'Remember, remember the FIFTH of November. The gunpowder, TREASON, and plot. I know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot.'
"Guys, Flynn was barely involved as national security adviser. He mostly just fetched coffee. And he's only 58! Basically still a child. Plus he's a proven liar, so we can't trust anything we hear about him. Nobody even remembers this guy."
"I was thinking that the younger Flynn would be a sleeper piece to this case a la Papadopoulos. He's obviously knowledgeable about a lot of his father's dirt and into a fair amount of his own, and per past Twitter history not nearly smart enough to cover his tracks adequately.  Father Flynn may not be willing to see his son  serve out 15-20 in federal pound-me-in-the-ass prison for Trump. "

'> According to Malloch, when he exited his flight from London he was taken aside by a TSA official and an FBI agent, and separated from his wife.\n\n> He said they told him it was a felony to lie to the FBI and he told them he would "gladly" cooperate with them. According to Malloch, the agents also produced a document allowing them to seize and search his cellphone.\n\n> He said they asked him about former Trump campaign adviser **Roger Stone**, author Jerome Corsi and **WikiLeaks**. Malloch said he told them he met Stone a total of three times and always with groups of people, and that Corsi had helped edit one of his books years ago.\n\n> He said he was asked if he had ever visited the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been living since 2012, and he replied no.\n\n> Malloch also said the agents served him a subpoena from Mueller\'s team that had been issued that day, March 28, and that he later arranged with the Special Counsel\'s Office to appear for questioning on April 13.\n\n-\n\n> A former professor at the University of Reading in the U.K. and the author of several books, he has a book coming out in May called "The Plot to Destroy Trump: How the Deep State Fabricated the Russian Dossier to Subvert the President."\n\n> Roger Stone wrote the forward. Infowars host Alex Jones and Brexiteer Nigel Farage have written blurbs for the book cover, according to Malloch\'s publisher.\n\nInsane.'

"Look, if there was NOTHING to the collusion, they would not be focusing like this THIS later after they started.  There is just no way they'd be doing it now if they looked, and there was not enough evidence, or none, or it was clear they couldn't bring people down with it.\n\n There is ample evidence, it's going to kill the WH, and there's nothing they can do about it.  Other than, you know... destroy the country.\n\n"

'Seeing these angry red hats makes me think Mueller struck a nerve. '
"God, so many times I felt *this is it, this is it, this is it, it's happening, happening fast* and then it wasn't but I feel like that again now. Detaining someone at the airport seems like an escalation."
"Loved that bit at the end about his book. Total nutjob or lying, self-serving sack of shit in bed with other lying sacks of shit. I'm thinking both."

"Trump:\n\n> The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!\n\nHe keeps saying the same things even tho they've all been proven **wrong**.\n\n"
"So much for [Dowd trying to cover up the fact that he got the idea from Trump](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-lawyer-its-time-to-fire-robert-mueller) huh?\n\nThis of course comes right after we learn [McCabe was interviewed by Mueller, and handed over Memos about his interactions with Trump, including information about Comey.](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/17/politics/mccabe-memos-trump/index.html)\n\nTrump will likely try to fire Mueller, he's had GOP/Hannity acting as his attack dogs for months now to try to give justification for firing him or undermining the investigation. That's all the Nunes memo, or the HPSCI GOP ending the investigation, or the Peter Strzok texts were trying to do. Find some false justification for ending the Mueller probe. There is a reason all the conspiracy comes from the same clowns. \n\nRosenstein will not fire Mueller though. So Trump will have to try to get rid of him as well. And even in the highly unlikely scenario where Mueller was fired, there are likely contingency plans. The investigation doesn't go away, the FBI still has the evidence. And I expect quite a lot of people to be protesting either way if it happens. \n\nThere is no escaping justice. No matter how much Trump wants to try. "
'> Gloat now, but you will be fired soon. And it’s not going to be done cowardly, as you’ve done to so many who’ve served you.

'>"The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime,"\n\nHow many people in your campaign have pled guilty to federal crimes again? Remind me.'
'Such doomed. Much desperate.'
'Then you shouldn’t have fired Comey, dumbass '
"He couldn't even act more guilty even if he tried. You can almost feel the pure panic radiating from this tweet."
'> The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime.\n\nA bit late for that spin, after multiple people pleading guilty and 13 Russians with a very detailed indictment detailing their election interference.'
"Mark my words fellow Americans, what you're seeing is the beginning of an attempt at a Dictatorship...firing everyone in the White House, firing the heads of the FBI, CIA...sound familiar? This was the same thing done at the start of Nazi Germany. Now a President who is an undisputable traitor is now trying to end all investigations against him. This is the beginning (Not exactly beginning as we've all seen this coming and have been for quite some time despite the media doing its best....Fox News and associates, to shut it down) of a man trying to consolidate power among his cronies and erase the truth. Get ready for a very interesting time in history. One where a corrupt leader tries to ruin his country in order to seek power and money...naturally at the expense of all others. We as a country will continue to be lied to, our media censored, and the facts swayed. Trump is a dangerous man, let there be no doubt, lest the history of corruption of so many shitty leaders be forgotten through thousands of years. I for one will stand against this corruption should the time come, who else will stand to?\ufeff\n \n\n"
"Trump is so fucking stupid. I don't inow how anyone can defend this clown at this point. I can only imagine what his Reddit cult is saying besides how corrupt Mueller is. "
'Fuckface is doing it tonight, isn’t he?'
'Jesus Christ he’s so desperate and disgusting '
"Trump's right. The GOP should never have let him run. Media should have never given him a platform spew hate. The Electoral college failed to protect us from an obvious demagogue. The GOP should have held you accountable for the n-th thing that would cause any other president to be impeached. etc. etc. et fucking cetra"
"Go fuck yourself you giant orange twat.  I will dance in the streets when you're in jail. "
"If you didn't want the Mueller probe, you shouldn't have had so many criminals on your campaign staff.  With multiple people already having been charged and admitting guilt, the days of pretending that this investigation is baseless are over.  "
'Fucking goddamn gop traitors. We need checks and balances and the rule of law. You fucking Republicans are ruining it for everyone.'
'I’ll be glad when this moron is out of office. I miss my country having a level-headed leader. Get his ass Mueller.'

"Interesting.\n\nSo last week the keebler elf was interviewed in the russia investigation by Mueller.\n\n~~This week he is pressuring the director of the FBI to fire the deputy director on behalf of trump~~ \n\nAnd now he's opening a probe into the missing text messages... how quaint.\n\n\nSeems a bit odd, don't you think?\n\nedits: Striked out the info on sessions pressuring the director since it happened prior and was only recently released. \n\nBut here's the timeline that's really interesting.\n\n> 1/17: Jeff Sessions interviews with Mueller.\n> \n> 1/18: House intel committee votes to share classified FISA memo with full House.\n> \n> 1/20: Sen. Johnson writes letter about 5 months of missing texts btw FBI officials.\n> \n> 1/22: Sessions vows to investigate missing texts.\n\nNothing to see here, right? "
"Today is not F5 all day it is F5 every other minute.\n\nSo in terms of stories from the past 24 hours...this is number 1 now right?\n\n1. FBI\n\n2. GOP senator hot Mic \n\n3. Oh yeah the shutdown \n\n4. Gerrymandering\n\n5. Ted Cruz lying \n\n6. More Gerrymandering \n\n7. Fallout from women's march \n\n9. Man tries to kill CNN.\n\n10. GOP senator has dinner with Gorsuch\n\n11. Trump screws over solar\n"
'Hell of a way to start Tuesday.'
"Sessions obviously relayed some bad news to Trump and now they're going psycho about phony memos and text messages. \n\nNow that people are following the Putinbots around it's easy to tell when Trump has been damaged politically. If the bots go nuts you know where your focus should be.\n\nThis ends with Trump's financial crimes."
"I'm starting to feel hopeless about all this.\n\nThe Justice department, the executive branch and the CIA (head) seemed to be ganging up against the FBI and Muller. \n\nTime and again, Trump and his hemorrhoids have lied, cheated and obstructed with seemingly no consequence. See Nunes for the latest example - jumps up and down about an FBI conspiracy, but refuses to spell out what his accusation is. \n\nThis will be one hell of an uphill battle. Prosecuting the AG sounds more difficult than impeaching the President."
'Remember when Sessions tried to quit but Trump rejected his resignation letter? The Ku Klux Keebler remembers.'
"Things are getting really tense. The bots are out in full force and there's way too many Republicans not taking any of this seriously. They're fighting against the investigation. Others are totally complacent. Mueller needs to get his work done asap. \n\nThis is one of the most politically charged events I've ever witnessed. With Trump's mouth, we know we're in for a rollercoaster. I'm definitely worried about future elections. What we're seeing isn't the usual political attack stunts. This is a serious propaganda campaign and it makes one wonder how far it will go. The next steps are towards more direct election tampering like voter fraud. \n\nOur government isn't defending us at this moment."
'Reading the article and it talking about Trump being upset at Sessions for recusing himself - it was a topic on Laura Ingraham\'s radio show this morning.  Don\'t really know much about her (other than name and she\'s a conservative) but she and her call-in guest (Joe someone) really went all out on Jeffy.\n\nThey said he had no balls, that he should be protecting the president, that he never should have recused himself, that he should have fired McCabe, should have fired Wray... I mean on and on.  She kept saying how much she liked him, but that he was caving to the liberal plot to oust Trump.\n\nHearing shit like that scares the hell out of me because it tells me these people have no real sense of justice whatsoever and only care about "winning."  She even flatly said that other than this whole Mueller thing, the president has done nothing but win since he took office.\n\nAt some point I have to believe that this isn\'t just radio shock-jock talk to get ratings and that these people really do believe the stupid shit they are saying.  The FBI was praised by Trump just under a year ago, until he started insulting them all and then suddenly because they don\'t do what he wants, they are corrupt and against him.  \n\nDo these people really not get how dangerous all of this is?  Do they not see what has happened in places like Turkey with authoritarian powers at work?\n\nIt is all getting to be a bit too much.'

'Mueller: "Mr. Sessions, let\'s b—..."\n\nSessions: "Russia!? I\'ve haven\'t met with any Russians! We had no secret meetings. I wasn\'t involved with the espionage I swear!

"#*A partial overview of Paul Manafort's past ~~crimes~~ career:*\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n***Washington, DC:***\n\n\n- **1976**: Delegate hunter for the President Ford Committee\n\n- **1978 - 1980**: Southern coordinator for Reagan's presidential campaign (and running-mate George H. W. Bush), deputy political director of RNC.\n\n- **1980**: Formed political lobbying firm Black, Manafort, [Roger] Stone, and Kelly; which was employed by Reagan's election campaign.\n\n- **1980 - 1981**: Personnel coordinator, Office of Executive Management, during the Reagan administration's transition period.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n\n***Black, Manafort, Stone, and Kelly:***\n\n\nThe lobbying firm created by Paul Manafort and Roger Stone used connections within the US government to generate military, political, and economic support for brutal dictators all over the world. In the mid-2000s, Transparency International released a list of the world's top kleptocrats - [three of the top four corrupt leaders were Manafort clients:](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/26/indonesia.philippines)\n\n\n> - Suharto (Indonesia, $15-35 billion)\n- Ferdinand Marcos (The Philippines, $5-10 billion) – **Manafort client**\n- Mobutu Sese Seko (Zaire, $5 billion) – **Manafort client**\n- Sani Abacha (Nigeria, $2-5 billion) – **Manafort client**\n\n\nManafort (and Roger Stone) have made their fortunes from this dirty money:\n\n>The well-connected Washington lobbying firm of Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly has seen dictators such as Somalia's Mohamed Siad Barre, the Philippines' late Ferdinand Marcos and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire vanish from its client list. **So Black, Manafort knows the value of a steadfast tyrant. In the case of Jonas Savimbi, the controversial Angolan rebel leader, it's $600,000 a year - plus expenses.**\n\n>Trouble is, between 1985 and 1992, Black, Manafort's cash cow may have indirectly been the U.S. Treasury.\n\n>**Up until 1992, Savimbi, whose UNITA guerrilla forces long battled the Soviet-allied Angolan government, received up to $60 million a year in U.S. aid.** Much of it took the form of guns, ammunition and other military supplies shipped by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) via Zaire (whose longtime military dictator, Mobutu, was a $1 million-per-year Black, Manafort client until December 1990).\n\n>**With most of his war supplies provided by the U.S., Savimbi was able to pay Black, Manafort some $5 million to lobby for U.S. aid, generate favorable U.S. media coverage and gin up political support in Washington.** With Black, Manafort's help, Savimbi has made at least five well-publicized trips to Washington, visiting President Reagan at the Oval Office, dining with former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and meeting with then-Vice President George Bush in 1988. [source](https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-13571831/on-the-town-with-jonas-savimbi)\n\n\n^ *This* is how Manafort and Stone got paid. Manafort's daughter put it best in a test message to her sister about their father:\n\n[“Don't fool yourself,” Andrea Manafort wrote. “That money we have is blood money.”](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/manaforts-ukrainian-blood-money-caused-qualms-hack-suggests-235473)\n\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n***The Torturer's Lobby***\n\nBlack, Manafort, Stone, and Kelly had no ethical boundaries in who they assisted.\n\nIn 1992,  the Center for Public Integrity released this report:\n\n[The Torturer's Lobby: How Human Rights-Abusing Nations Are Represented in Washington](https://cloudfront-files-1.publicintegrity.org/legacy_projects/pdf_reports/THETORTURERSLOBBY.pdf) [pdf link]\n\nManafort and Stone's lobbying firm appears throught the document.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n\n***Some of Manafort's past clients:***\n\n\n\n- **Ferdinand Marcos** - Authoritarian leader of the Philippines from 1965-1986. His regime was famous for its corruption and extreme brutality, and supported by the US government. In 1986 Marcos fled the Philippines with his stolen wealth and was granted asylum by the US government, where he lived the rest of his life in exile.\n\n\n- **Mobutu Sese Soko** - Military dictator of DRC / Zaire from 1965-1997. Seized power through military coup d'etat. *The* classic African dictator - deeply criminal but willing to be a US ally, Mobutu destroyed his country through nepotism and embezzlement. In 1997 Mobutu fled Zaire and lived the rest of his life in exile.\n\n\n- **Sani Abacha** - De facto President of Nigeria from 1993-1998. Seized power through military coup d'etat, for the ~5 years he and his family were in power they stole $5+ billion from the government.\n\n\n- **Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo** - President of Equatorial Guinea 1979-present. Seized power through military coup d'etat, currently the second longest-serving non-royal leader in the world. His government is effectively a legal dictatorship, and has been marked by corruption.\n\n\n- **Siad Barre** - President of Somalia 1969-1991. Seized power through coup d'etat. Regime characterized by widespread human rights abuses and authoritarian rule. In 1991 Barre fled Somalia and lived the rest of his life in exile.\n\n\n- **Viktor Yanukovych** - President of Ukraine 2010-2014. In 2014 Yanukovych fled Ukraine; he is currently living in exile and wanted in Ukraine for treason.\n\n\n- **Donald Trump** - President of the United States 2017-present.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n\n***Other scandals:***\n\n- **The Karachi Affair** - [(Timeline)](http://www.france24.com/en/20101118-karachi-bombing-pakistan-submarine-sales-timeline-france-sarkozy-villepin-chirac-justice-corruption-mediapart-luxembour) In 2002, 11 French engineers working in Pakistan were killed by a suicide bomber. They were there to assemble a fast-attack submarine purchased from France. The bombing was initially blamed on al Qaeda, but was later discovered to be financially motivated: the 1994 sale of French submarines to Pakistan had involved massive amounts of bribery, kickbacks, and illicit payments to both Pakistani and French middlemen. A confidential report by France's intelligence service found that a discontinuation of payments was the reason for the attack. [In 2013, Manafort admitted to being paid by middlemen in the arms sale.](http://www.france24.com/en/20130804-karachi-affair-karachigate-us-political-consultant-new-clues-balladur-france-pakistan) \n\n\n- **Employment by Pakistan's intelligence agency** - From 1990-1995, Manafort received $700,000 to lobby on behalf of the Kashmiri American Council (KAC) - a covert front organization for Pakistan's ISI: \n> The investigation unveiled an elaborate scheme on the part of the Pakistani government to influence Washington policymakers while hiding behind a seemingly innocuous nonprofit organization.

'The funniest part of the indictment is Manafort\'s company DMI has a "30 day email retention policy" to prevent investigators from obtaining emails...LOL does their email server have a 4 GB USB hard drive? No company would ever do that unless they were up to suspicious shit from the very start. '
"No wonder that Trump and GOP has been getting extra antsy about shutting down the investigation when they knew that there was collusion that could be proven so conclusively.\n\nIt's stupid how obvious they are."
"I don't want to rush to judgement, but I'm starting to think Manafort might not be the 'best people'."
"Manafort was already fucked. I want Stone or Don Jr. for fuck's sake."
"Seems pretty damning. Manafort is yet another disgusting animal exhibit in this shit zoo of an administration that is hell bent on destroying democracy. Less than 10 years ago conservatives were insisting that letting gays get married was going to ruin the country, and this whole time, it was conservatives doing the deed. Who'd have thunk it?"
"Every day I wonder why this idiot ran for president. He could've had a cushy life until he died. "
'Hey you guys remember when Obama’s campaign manager was a scumbag traitor? Oh wait...'
"So what are his options? Going to jail next Friday and him and his family losing EVERYTHING and being homeless and ruined.\n\nOr....cut a deal and get protection for him and his family and keep his shit?\n\nHoping Muller doesn't need him and ruins the whole family and he get buttloved for the rest of his life in jail."
"As Rachel Maddow said today Trump has to pardon Kilimnik  along with Manafort if he wants to end that part of the investigation.  So just as Rachel said a few days ago if Trump wants to pardon everyone to end this Russian investigation then he's going to have to pardon the Russians too.  Only an idiot with a death wish would do that, but Trump would be stupid enough to do that.  "

'While this is a popular idea here ("Trump/the White House should be paralyzed until the investigation is complete") I actually don\'t agree.\n\nShould Trump not be able to do stuff? Most likely.\n\n**But** does that mean we go "if an administration/sitting POTUS is under investigation, they shouldn\'t be able to do anything"? I say no. That gives **incredible** power to the FBI/whomever else is conducting the investigation and would literally paralyze 1/3 of the government for months/years at a time.\n\nNot saying it\'s the case here, but what if the investigation showed no wrongdoing? Did we put the cart before the horse? Punish someone for something they didn\'t do?\n\nIt\'s very easy to go "oh yeah Trump should be stopped!" but the implications of such a restriction goes beyond him.'

Until then it should function as normally as possible. \n\nIf any of those dipshits have ever seen one gangster film you never put the boss in the same room as the killer.'
'This is my problem with our current political situation: DEMOCRATS ARE TOO PATIENT.\n\nYou’d think they’d all be collectively kicking and screaming in the fight against the far right and their oligarchical aspirations. But no, our leaders feel they can sit and wait until Mueller makes his move meanwhile an entire system is working tirelessly to overtake our government.\n\nI know I may be off base, but I’m tired of playing the waiting game. Democrats have proven to be terrible long term strategists, and I’m just worried that before we can get Trump out of office the damage will already be done and the house, senate and judiciary branch will be republican owned for the next generation. \n\nWe need to be more vocal in calling out McConnell and his ilk on all of their BS. Otherwise we’re all screwed. '
"I wish more people would realize that the GOP will do NOTHING. This is exactly what all of them want, even starting a nasty war that kills a bunch of foreigners and liberals.

'What are the chances they are looking into hacked voting machines? I know we have been told over and over that no vote counts were changed, but I find it hard to believe that so many were potentially tampered with and no vote tallys were changed.'
"I've been cautiously optimistic about this from day one, but in the face of Congress and a President bitching about expenses and talking about using that as an excuse to kill this investigation Muller hiring another expert is some big stuff.\n\nEven if Trump himself walks away from this, everyone in his inner circle who has ever committed a fraud against the US Government or one of its United States is going to be strung up by the heels.\n\nIf nothing else, maybe it will wake people up to how serious this is."

"Given the case law created around Clinton, I don't think they are going to avoid it. Plus, trying to do so, is going to make Trump look even more guilty of having committed a crime. "
"If they *just now* started researching precedent then Trump really does have the worst fucking lawyers.\n\nWe've known where Mueller's investigation would end since last June. These guys are so bad at their jobs."
'Please, Trump supporters. Explains this to us. You have been screaming and crying that Hillary provided testimony but was not under oath (which doesn’t matter as lying would still constitute a crime regardless), but Stable Genius and his lawyer’s are trying to avoid it all together?\n\nBetter yet, don’t bother. You can’t defend it, at least not without twisting yourself into a hypocritical \U0001f968 '
"Real question here: has anyone in the media started to have the discussion about what's going to happen when this is all over? I feel like we're only thinking half way here, like the fish at the end of Finding Nemo. \n\nHe's gonna go, either through impeachment or regiznation and then who will be left? Pence? Ryan? How will this shake out. \n\nAnd is anyone going to address the fact he WILL become a martyr to his base. And that base will be PISSED and ready to raise holy hell. "
"> “You fight back, oh, it’s obstruction,” Trump mockingly told reporters.\n\nIf you fight an investigation into Russia's involvement in the US election, you fight for Russia and against America."
"Anyone who thinks Trump will ever step foot in front of Mueller are goddamned delusional. Everyone knows he's guilty so there's nothing for for him to gain and everything to lose from doing it. He has repeatedly shown he doesn't give two shits for the rule of law and he believes he's above all of it and he will do everything in his power to avoid it up to firing Mueller and purging the FBI. And of course Congress won't do shit, again anyone who believes they will are also delusional. The groundwork has already been put in place and his base laps that shit up. There's been zero actual effort to even begin to counter the incredibly sophisticated attack still ongoing from Russia.  \n\n~~Time to wake up sheeple~~ If sweeping changes aren't made in the next congressional election Trump may become President for Life..and his base will cheer.\n\nScary times indeed.\n\nAnd anyone who wants to argue? We have an admitted rapist, openly racist, alleged child molester, money laundering buffoon with zero experience who has literally lied thousands of times and has repeatedly and unquestionably profited from his Presidency all while doing his best to sabotage HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION in order to derail an investigation that includes a foriegn attack upon our nation...and he's in the driver's seat of our democracy. \n\nI fear for my children and any person who doesn't have a dick, wealth and white skin.\n\n*Edited to strikethrough my sheeple comment. I didn't want to delete it outright however I can see how it could come off as me being a dick, my apologies*\n\n\n"
"How pathetic. The compulsive liar is admitting he cannot even try to tell the truth. And if he tells the truth, he's fucked. "
'Why? If you’re innocent the you have nothing to hide.  \n\nThe fucking hypocrites on the Wrong believe that they have the right to take your privacy because “you should have nothing to hide.”  Lets ruin them.   Lets hold their feet to the fire until they burn, scald them on the same blame they used to take our rights repeatedly.  Only when we take them to the hot iron will they realize how Wrong they are.'
"Well no shit. This was predicted by pretty much everyone. He said he would speak with Mueller just to get the attention on that, convincing his loyal(brainwashed) followers that he was innocent and could answer anything Mueller threw at him. \n\nBut anyone with an actual brain(Those who didn't vote for Trump) would realize it was just a publicity stunt, to try to distract from how shitty and corrupt he is. He wanted to appear like there was nothing wrong. \n\nBut his intention was clear from the beginning. He would never ever want to meet with Mueller. Because he is guilty. And now he will blame his lawyers as the reason he won't meet with him. \n\nBeing an American, having Trump as our President, makes me hate being an American more than anything else. It used to be a kind of good thing to be an American. \n\nNow, under Trump, it's an embarrassment to admit you are an American. \n\nFuck this guy and all that he stands for. And fuck all of his racist, freedom hating supporters he has. \n\n"
"I don't know why they wouldn't just let Mr. Diarrhea-of-the-Mouth talk to Mueller. After all the was NO COLLISION and NO OBSTRUCTION. \n\nIf he interviews, the result will be a YouTube video that we will be watching the rest of our lives."
"It's official: Trump is too stupid and too guilty to face Mueller without incriminating himself.     \n\nWhat a prick. "
'Mueller’s just going to charge him anyways.\n\nThe man has enough to charge Trump with a multitude of things. That only thing he’s missing is a charge of lying to the FBI.'
"It's almost like they know what he did was illegal and he's too stupid not to incriminate himself."
'Charlie Dent is on MSNBC right now.... He is trying to be non-partisan, but he it’s somewhat failing. If Republicans want to have more support, they need to call out Nunes, Issa, Gaetz, etc on their bullshit'
"Why are these people that committed treason still on the streets?If it were a regular Joe they'd be locked up real quick before they could do any more damage. The longer they wait to arrest these traitors the worse off our country is going to be. Get your shit together & get them away from fucking up our country more than they already have."

'Mostly lying to the FBI, no big deal. No collusion, no collusion, no collusion. /s'
'This is severely misleading.\n\nMost of the crimes were indictments against Paul Manafort for things he did long before he was chairman of the Trump campaign. Mueller didn\'t "uncover" those crimes, he went to the FBI and DOJ and took the case files of investigations that were previously being worked on, but not brought to trial \\(for whatever reason\\).\n\nOther indictments were for what were called "process crimes," such as lying to the FBI. Sending agents to speak to someone and then catching them in a lie is hardly "uncovering a crime."'
'One can interpret this exactly like you’d see a seasoned prosecutor process information set aside some knowns (which include indictments and guilty pleas) and keep following the investigation. *The evidence against the President is irrefutable at this point. No, Trump isn’t the goddamm target, he’s just the star-struck, greedy mook in this mess!*\n\nMueller knows this, he just set that aside in his quest for the truth: Where’d the money go, who got the influence? ...and bet he’ll get there too. \n\nHe’ll stop right damn close or right in the same room with Putin holding the cash. Then he’ll stop. ..and everyone, America and the world: Yeah!  they actually fucking did it :|'
'My trump supporting friends and family say that the crimes so far are puffed or not worthy the investigation. \n\nThe media is accusing the president of treason, corruption and collusion. After a year all Mueller has is “lying to the feds” as a crime. The magnitude between what has been accused and what has been uncovered is night and day. \n\nIf you spend millions or dollars with an army of the worlds best lawyers you’re going  to uncover something. And this is all they can come up with? Shut it down. No collusion!\n\nI’ve decided I’m going to bite my tongue and wait until the real shit comes down. Because in the meantime they are getting more rabid and unbearable. '

'This may not be a popular comment, but what did people expect. Our media has infantilized a generation and our education system has been unable to instill critical thinking skills in large portions of the population. That’s what happens when you strip educational resources to the bone and let people inject their insane ideas into the common curriculum. The crimes being uncovered are predominantly white collar. I bet a lot of those people that don’t know about these crimes think money laundering involves a literal washing machine.'
'Can confirm. I just had a Facebook argument with a couple of middle aged women who were calling this investigation a "waste of tax dollars" and "not 1 shred of evidence" having been found. When I pointed out the indictments and plea deals that had already been executed, it was crickets.'
"I'm curious why we hold some people accountable in government, and not others? Why are we charging Papadopoulos, Gates, and Flynn have all been charged and pled guilty to making false statements.  By charging former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn for lying to the FBI, Mueller emphasized that even the appearance of false testimony is felonious behavior.\n\nIf that is so, then the DOJ will likely have to charge former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe with perjury or related offenses. A report from the Office of the Inspector General indicates that McCabe lied at least four times to federal investigators.\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey may also have lied to Congress when he testified that he had not written his report on the Hillary Clinton email scandal before interviewing Clinton. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former CIA Director John Brennan lied under oath to Congress on matters related to surveillance.\n\nClinton aides Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin likely lied when they told FBI investigators they had no idea that their then-boss, Hillary Clinton, was using an illegal private email server. Both had communicated with Clinton about it. Mueller is also said to be investigating whether Trump or his advisers broke laws concerning the release of confidential government information.\n\nIf so, the DOJ may have to indict Comey. He confessed to passing along confidential FBI memos to a friend for the expressed purpose of leaking their contents to the press."
'Most Americans are stupid. More shocking news at 11.....'

'Most of us are STUPID'
'"Most Americans" is a meaningless figure anymore. That number is gathered from online polls, which are now meaningless and will never have meaning again. They are easily and constantly manipulated. '
'* Michael Flynn, former national security adviser and a key Trump campaign surrogate, pleaded guilty to making false statements to federal investigators in December.\n\n* Rick Gates, a top aide on the Trump campaign and a longtime business partner of Paul Manafort, pleaded guilty to false statements and one count of conspiracy.\n\n* George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser on the campaign, pleaded guilty to false statements.\n\n* Alexander van der Zwaan, a London-based Dutch attorney, pleaded guilty to making false statements about his contacts with Gates and an unnamed Ukrainian.\n\n* 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies have been indicted on conspiracy charges, and some on identity theft charges, related to Russian social media and hacking efforts.\n\n* Richard Pinedo, a California resident, has pleaded guilty to an identity theft charge related to the Russian indictments.\n\n* Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign chair, is facing two separate indictments — one in DC about conspiracy, money laundering, false statements, and failure to disclose foreign assets; and one in Virginia about tax, financial, and bank fraud charges.'
"The problem with all of this is the number of Americans who are 100% serious in their stance that since Hillary Clinton 'got away' with Bengahzi, the email thing, and every cooked-up conspiracy like Uranium One, pay-to-play (otherwise known as 'you have to pay off the republicans first if you're going to destroy America'), that until she's hauled to jail and kept there until she is sentenced to prison, everything is an unfair witch hunt against trump.\n\nI still can't tell whether all the crimes that will eventually be uncovered is because Trump really is that cozy with Russia, or if foreign governments goaded trump into all this because they all really believe Hillary 'got away with it all' so they think they can too."
'95% of our populace is brain dead. '
'Sadly, the Trump investigation* is shaping up to be more like Iran-Contra than Watergate.\nIran-Contra was a big deal, certainly much worse for the country that lying about a blowjob, but a few people went to Jail, got pardoned an the President just moved on.

'At first I was surprised that Bannon was the first of the inner circle to go before a grand jury; but considering this happened LAST WEEK after all the Fire and Fury chaos ... something strategic is obviously happening that is beyond my ken.\n\nAnd I like it!'
"I don't know what Mueller thinks he is going to find by talking to Steve.  He was such a low level guy in the campaign and in the White House.  Nobody even really knew his name until that fictitious book came out.\n\nedit: whoa!  People took this seriously?  I guess there are no more implicit /s's anymore. :("
"I hope he is really angry at the Mercer family, and shows us everything that has anything to do with Cambridge Analytica and Russians.\n\nAlso Bannon feels like to me if he witnessed a crime he will go ahead and say it because in his mind they shouldn't have committed the crime in the first place. I don't think Bannon will be used directly as a witness but he could lead the way on what questions to ask what people. Also compare his story to what Flynn has given up and straighten the timeline even more.\n\nJared Kushner seems like the type of person who is too dumb to even realize that he should be worried. I can I see that stupid grin on his face all the way to federal jail or witness protection."
'Mueller is savage. He’s picked the exact moment when Bannon is feeling vulnerable, left adrift without a paddle and his reputation in shreds. This is no accident, the sharks have smelt blood. '
"Not that I think Trump is planning to fire Mueller...\n\nBut it'd be 100x as politically damaging for him to do so now that subpoenas have starting coming into his inner circle."
'I like where this is going.\n\nEspecially since there is little that will cause more chaos than spilling out everything. Bannon loves chaos. He can create a lot of chaos here.\n\nHopefully it also all blows up in his gin-soaked face.\n\nJust a reminder for some of the people who may not have followed this thing obsessively: Bannon was the campaign CEO from August, then the first employee to enter the White House. He was Chief Strategist until he was fired. Bannon was in the inner circle for nearly a year. He knows a lot. A whole lot.'
'You know how I can tell this is a big deal?\n\nBecause the Trump-bot line in this thread is just "Oh, nothing matters, this won\'t lead to anything".\n\nNo pivots to Hillary.  No calling it fake news.  No attempts to distract with silly conspiracy theories.\n\nThey know this is a big deal.  And all they can do is pretend to be whiny and apathetic.'
"There is no universe in which Jared is not completely and totally fucked by this. There isn't a single person on this earth that Bannon hates more than Kushner. He blames everything that went wrong with Trump on Jared having the President's ear and giving him bad advice while turning Trump against Bannon.\n\nIf I were Jared I would start packing for Cumberland.

"> However, some of Trump’s close advisers and friends fear a face-to-face interview with Mueller could put the president in legal jeopardy. A central worry, they say, is Trump’s lack of precision in his speech and his penchant for hyperbole.\n\nThey mean Trump's penchant **for lying**."

"https://twitter.com/SethAbramson/status/955920445726973952\n\nSeth Abramson sums it up in a few paragraphs, very well-written.\n\n>**(THREAD) BREAKING**: We now know two topics Mueller plans to ask Trump about: the Flynn firing and the Comey firing. And Trump is demanding that he be able to answer some questions in writing—an obvious attempt to get most or all of the questions in advance.\n  \n>**2/** The Washington Post also reports that Mueller wants to ask Trump about some related events, such as his attempts to pressure Sessions into resigning—a resignation which would have allowed Trump to appoint a new AG, and possibly given him a quick path to firing Mueller himself.\n   \n>**3/** Trump allies will seize on this story as evidence that Mueller has nothing on Trump that's directly related to Russia—a talking point you should entirely ignore, as Mueller asking Trump about Flynn (who is a cooperating witness for Mueller) is a doorway to asking about Russia.\n   \n>**4/** So yes, Mueller can ask about Flynn in a way that gets to the Obstruction question (i.e., Comey's firing) but he can also ask Trump about Flynn in a way that gets to what orders Trump gave Flynn (or others) as to negotiating sanctions with Russia during or after the campaign.\n   \n>**5/** More importantly, it's clear Mueller is much further along in his (*far easier*) Obstruction investigation than in the Conspiracy investigation—which explains why the topics he has for Trump at the moment (quite apart from what topics he might have later) focus on Obstruction.\n   \n>**6/** We know Mueller has a ways to go on his Conspiracy probe (whether it be Money Laundering-, campaign finance-, or Computer Crimes-related) because he's still seeking bank records from Europe. So it's *far* too early for him to have what he needs to ask Trump about those issues.\n   \n>**7/** Mueller knows there's *one thing* that protects him from being fired: having already referred an indictment for Obstruction to the DOJ (and likely, then, from DOJ to Congress). Why? Because Trump firing him *then* would be: (a) consciousness of guilt, and (b) more Obstruction.\n   \n>**8/** So Mueller needs to move fast on Obstruction before he's fired—and it's the easier case to make (and an impeachable offense) anyway. Nothing about The Washington Post story means Mueller isn't *also* working the Russia conspiracy angle and *won't* want to ask Trump about that.\n   \n>**9/** Granted, referring an Obstruction indictment to DOJ permanently ends all communication between Mueller and Trump—but it's little matter to Mueller: Trump is more likely to struggle to tell the truth on the Obstruction issue. On Russia, he'll just claim ignorance of everything.\n   \n>**10/** And of course if Mueller's fired he can't ask Trump about *anything*—so he has to take what he can get now, particularly if it keeps Trump from firing him. But the separate Russia angle to the Mueller investigation remains 100% alive and well after this Washington Post story.\n   \n>**CONCLUSION/** Be wary of the news over the next day: many people who don't follow the Russia story closely (and many anchors on cable news, even) will try to imply that this Washington Post story means Mueller is *only* pursuing Obstruction. \n\n>That's false—and we *know* it's false.\n"

"Imagine being 71 years old. Your money is all tied up in real estate and you can't get a loan stateside because of your reputation for not paying people back. You start borrowing from Russia in exchange for some laundering. No big deal. No one will find out. \n\n\nWith your name being the most profitable thing you own, you decide to get a corner of the conservative news market, TrumpTV. Afterall, these people have been eating up your birther non-sense for the past 8 years, they're rubes, they're idiots and they're mad. \n\n\nLike any new product launch, you need a marketing campaign. Last time you ran for president it gave you a boost. Sure you ducked out early because there was no way in hell you could beat Obama but it showed you something much more important, your new audience and what would later slim down into your base. \n\n\nSo you're blessed with a cattle call of candidates. Dividing and splitting away the neo-con establishment's ability to pick their mule. You make it to the general. Now here's where Flynn, Lewandowski and Manfort really sale you on a Russian deal. Voter rolls that can be used to micro-target swing states through tailored social media fake news and massive ad buys on Facebook and twitter. Not to mention, hundreds of millions of bots created on Russian farms pushing all of it. If it works you're President. If it doesn't you can spend the next years of your life getting TrumpTV off the ground with claims the election was rigged. My guess is Trump bet on the latter. His face on election night tells that story. \n\n\nNow he's here. Maybe months away from being completely exposed. The tweets, the constant unrest, and stress, the ridiculous daily bullshit, it can't save him from what is being put together by the man who we chose to lead the FBI directly after September 11th, 2001.\n\n\nTo say the least, I think it's safe to say Donald J.

"Okay so my take on this development given the announcements yesterday (Rosenstein, Manafort, etc):  \n  \nBasically, Rosenstein being interviewed and now the search for White House documents suggest that Trump himself (alongside Sessions) is being investigated for obstruction. I think this story more or less confirms it. They interviewed Rosenstein supposedly and now the request for documents about firing Comey suggests that Mueller is probably finding tons of holes in their official reasons for firing Comey- Clinton's Email Investigation.  \n  \nI bet there's a recording, document, email, or some sort of smoking gun showing that Trump fired Comey specifically over the Russia investigation and then had Sessions and/or Rosenstein (likely not Rosenstein, judging by the language in yesterday's story about him) lie about it and create a front that Clinton's Emails were the real reason. I'm guessing Mueller already has evidence or testimony of some sort confirming Trump and Sessions cooked this up in a lame attempt to end the Russia investigation.  \n  \nPair this with Trump's disclosure to the Russians in the Oval Office as well as his admission to Lester Holt that he fired Comey over Russia, and boom you have a very unreliable potential testimony from Trump already. And I feel like Mueller will have an airtight obstruction case, given that same charge (after the smoking gun tape was found) ended up sinking Nixon. Although, Nixon had a democrat congress after 1972, which is odd. But most Republicans supported impeachment after the smoking gun tape came out.  \n  \nIt's a matter of time before a similar revelation of evidence will occur and if the GOP leadership sees it'll sink their majority in 2018, they'll bail on Trump. Unless, of course, it really is this giant conspiracy involving nearly every high-up republican congressman or senator. Then we're going to have a crisis akin to the Civil War."

He has no idea that this is Mueller's turf and on this turf Mueller is a God among men. \n\nMueller is about to wipe the floor with Trump. Mueller is like Darth Vader, Superman, Wolverine, Neo, Arya Stark, and Thor all wrapped up in Captain America.\n\nTrump is an even stupider version of Dr. Evil.\n\nAnd he honestly has no clue how bad it is yet.

">Special counsel Robert Mueller’s office has told a federal judge it has found evidence that Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, committed bank fraud not addressed by the indictment last October in which he was charged with money laundering and failure to register as a foreign agent.\n.\n\nMueller has had a big day, and I'm thrilled."
'Prosecutors’ references to “conspiracies” suggest that someone beyond Manafort was involved in the alleged fraud, but no further details were given.\n\nWhat a day today eh? '
"It's been a VERY bad week for the Trump faithful.\n\nWhat will they do when their GEOTUS is in prison for treason?\n\n"
'There goes the argument that because nobody\'s been charged with anything specifically related to Trump colluding with Russia there must be no collusion.\n\nI had someone argue that nonsense to my face today, and then they insisted there couldn\'t be any more charges coming because if they had more evidence they would have charged them already. I wondered when that argument would fall apart spectacularly. I didn\'t expect the answer to be "about four hours". '
'All of Trump’s anxieties are about his financial dealings because he and the rest of his family are all involved (or at least had knowledge).  Trump only exists because the Russian mob, oligarchs and Italian mob used him to launder their money. If not he’d be the welfare son of a racist real estate developer.'
"From what I'm reading (correct me if I'm wrong) this doesn't have much to do with the Russia investigation. This has to do with Manafort allegedly attempting to avoid taxes by exaggerating losses from his business ventures, correct?"
'Is Manafort fucked in every orifice he has?'
'Trump seen taking a crossbow to his bedroom, proceeding to browse for whores on craigslist.'
'The lead was thoroughly buried:\n\n> Prosecutors’ references to “conspiracies” suggest that someone beyond Manafort was involved in the alleged fraud, but no further details were given.'
'Hurray, here come the financial fraud and money laundering charges. *This* in my armchair expert opinion is what will bring down Trump and every one of his hemmaoroids.'
"I'll bet he is pissed that all four of his passports were confiscated. "

'It never ever seems to have an end. There is no bottom too low for the GOP. I’m disgusted. Traitors! Every damn one of them are traitors to our Constitution. It breaks my heart.'
'I\'m actually really curious about this as it seems to be a different tactic that McConnell in the Senate.  McConnell, by my read, is trying to head off a situation where Republicans will have to take a formal stance on a highly controversial issue (protecting Mueller, and to a less extent Rosenstein).\n\nThe actions in Congress however seem to be driving a similar confrontation to a head.\n\nNote that the Committee can push a privileged resolution for contempt to the house floor, but the entire house must vote on it.  With how vulnerable the house is already to flipping Dem, it really seems like a bad play for Ryan to let this come to the floor.\n\nSo the big question is, is this a bluff?  Are the committee Republicans trying to get a hold of the documents for the reasons listed in the article, and will fold if Rosenstein comes up with a "reasonable" reason to refuse, or will they push for a full house vote to push for Contempt if he refuses, which will setup a public show down that, again, I cannot image the House leadership wants.'

'a lot of Republicans still think Nixon could have avoided resigning if he were even more sneaky and the Republicans of the time covered for him'
"How a good chunk of our country is oblivious to all this or just don't care boggles the mind, it's saddening and frustrating.  People are proud of their ignorance as long as it pisses off everyone who isn't a republican."
'Firing Mueller would be the single dumbest thing Trump does at this stage in the game. He shouldve fired him months ago and the damage control wouldve been much easier. At this point It would unleash hell. Mueller has been preparing since day one to get fired. You dont think there are back ups built in NY for indictments? There are already sealed documents floating about. The trap is laid, and if the Don fires Mueller its checkmate on donnie because the gloves come off, people will be in the streets and then all of the real evidence can be presented because it is a constitutional crisis.'
'No shit. Republicans are treasonous dicks. '
'The GOP is gleefully killing American Democracy. They are a cancer, unfit to govern, and every last one of them need to be voted out of office.'
"Why have no GOP congress members been indicted?  There is no doubt they're committing crimes.  I've never been so disgusted with this country in my life.  "
"Look at where the investigation has led Mueller? Right into the GOP's coffers.\n\nTheir embracing of Trump in order to gain control of all branches of government has literally resulted in their sources of money being investigated, and Mueller is finding shit in there.\n\nHad they rejected Trump no one would have known.\n\nSo now the cockroaches are all in a panic at the possibility of being outed for the fucking traitors they are.\n\nHence, where we are now."
'America is so messed up. I\'m constantly amazed at how my republican friends are so "we\'ve got it so hard, everyone hates us, the media hates us, everyone is against us" when they "own" all three branches of government. \n\npathetic. '
'To save their own hide. They are up to their gills in Russian and black money. And the Russian hack of the GOP likely returned damning data regarding their anti poor and minority platform that they would not like the public to know about. They must obstruct justice or be caught. They have to destroy democracy to preserve their position.'
'I still find this strange given how the majority of them thought Trump was the worst case scenario to their primary.'
"They all need to be charged with obstruction, in the least, possibly conspiracy. Their hindering a criminal investigation. I don't know what else you could call this."
'They simply don’t want to be faced with incontrovertible proof that their president is a criminal, actively committing crimes in the White House, and possibly even a traitor. If that happens, they HAVE to act, but that would simply hurt their poll numbers with their base and they’re cowards. \n\nIt’s absolutely shameful. '
'I would introduce a legal name change for Mitch fucking McConnell. Rename him to reflect what he is, call him; "state cancer", or "senate syphilis", or "mud face Mitch McCrupt", or "deep state herpes", or "dung democracy dweep". Both Ryan and this twat should be fed to a graphite inferno.'
'Why the heck are people so obsessed with Trump?  The man is the worst human being on the planet.  Who wants to tie themselves to him and risk prison?'
'Who is more guilty?  The criminal, or the people who protect the criminal?'

'The Yahoo version of this story was linked on Drudge. The comments are just... I don\'t even know what to make of them any more.\n\n>"Talking to Mueller would be a big mistake. Mueller knows there is no collusion and the only reason to talk to Trump would be to try to trap him into a lie like he did Flynn"\n\n-\n>"bull! Trump is going to entrap MUELLER and then FIRE HIM."\n\n-\n>"Trump is awesome! He sure knows how to keep the unstable leftists screaming at tje sky and in constant crisis. Knowing Trump the entire thing is already worked out and coming to an end. Stable genius."\n\n-\n>"Trump knows lawyers better than most and surrounds himself with the best. My sense is there is a deal being worked out to save face for both Mueller and Trump. Let\'s end this fake inquiry and turn towards the real enemy: Hildabeast“\n\n-\n>”The entire point of everything Mueller has done is to weave together a narrative so that no matter what Trump says one way or another he has someone on record contradicting him, and it will be someone close to him and he will be forced to attack said person and undermine credibility. Oh yea, I\'m totally loving all this law and order. Martial law please, order us out into the streets to hang these communists and we will do it in a heartbeat.“\n\n-\n>”Mueller is expert at entrapping people and turning the slightest fumbling of words into crimes. #$%$ of the Earth. Listen to your lawyers, President Trump. Let Mueller send you a list of questions in writing, and your lawyers answer them in writing. Meanwhile, indict Clinton, Comey, Lynch, Obama, Mueller, et al for their very real and easily proven felonies.“\n\n\nI only post these comments just to show how the "other side" is thinking about this. It seriously saddens me that so many of my fellow Americans are so uninformed about what\'s actually going on and have no idea how any of this works.'
'“All the grownups around me keep warning me not to stick my fork into the electrical outlet. But what the hell do they know!”'
'In the comments of the “Dowd Quits Donnie” article, it was hypothesized that Trump wasn’t listening to Dowd and was about to do something so monumentally stupid that Dowd had to resign or go down with the ship. The ideas were either “Trump fires Mueller” or “Trump meets with Mueller.” The question was which was it.\n\nThis answers that question.'
"How did this moron survive to a ripe old age without going to prison already? He's like the dumb violent kid in middle school who isn't afraid of the cops. Do it, Donnie. DO IT."
'And that explains why Dowd decided to quit today.\n\nThis interview is happening folks, no two ways about it. I expect Mueller to drop charges on Trump before the end of the summer.\n\nEDIT: Also, how many GOPers in the Senate & House right now are shitting their pants? All of them?'
"This feeble line is for his supporter's consumption.  The last thing Trump is *ever* going to do is submit to questioning where he will be under oath and cannot lie and deflect.  Ultimately, he will fight to the very end to avoid sitting in front of Mueller's team of crack lawyers."
'I hope this doesnt turn into "I was planning on cooperating, but this darn new AG fired him before I could!"'
"This has to be why Dowd wanted out. He knows that no amount of legal strategy can defend Donny if he testifies. Dowd is no dummy he's fully aware of how dumb and how prone to lying Trump is. Lawyers live or die by the amount of big cases that they win and he's not taking a guaranteed L."
"**My biggest fear:** \nTrump comes out of this interview complete unscathed legally, because he goes in an makes a bunch of claims, Mueller has evidence disproving his entire testimony from multiple sources, and it becomes clear he actually had 0 idea what was going on with his campaign, he is all talk, and his obsession with Russia and Putin is one of pure jealously, not out of being compromised.\n\nLong story short: He's completely incompetent, and has no idea he's surrounded by traitors, and gets to stay in the White House because he literally had no idea what put him there."
"Trump has been able to talk and bully his way out of trouble and get what he wants his whole life so he thinks can do so here too. He's never tried to talk his way out of something this big before. The last time I know the federal gov't. was after him I remember they got him for housing discrimination. "
'Coming at this from a different, psychological angle: could this be l\'appel du vide (the call of the void)? Perhaps Trump is so exhausted by everything in his Presidency that he just wants it to end. He wants to go to the edge of the cliff and jump off. I\'m not sure if it\'s a conscious thing or a subconscious thing, but either way. To go Freudian on it: Maybe his ego is telling him to do it based on the dumb assumption that he could beat the Mueller team, which is fueled by his id which wants him to get out of this stressful situation. \n\nThe guy is old and in way over his head. But he also has an ego, and he might not see resignation as an option because that\'s "giving up." So perhaps he wants to get impeached, so he can continue to go kicking and screaming about conspiracies, witch hunts, and fake news. He (along with his followers) will blame it on some deep state bullshit. He gets to preserve his ego by going down saying it was all a lie, while getting out of the stress of being President. Seems like a win-win, if he can manage to avoid prison. Maybe he thinks he can be pardoned like Nixon.'
"So, some people are saying his lawyer left because Trump was going to fire Mueller. It's really possible he left because Trump was going to testify, which would be an equally bad idea. "
'I think it’s just sickening that we live in a time when Trump can attack our greatest politicians in modern history with childless quips referring to beating them up like some grade school bully, threatening leaders of other countries over Twitter, while endlessly kowtowing to his Russian overlord, calls Putin to congratulate him on a rigged election while ignoring bipartisan imposed sanctions on him for meddling in our democratic process and killing citizens of other countries in broad daylight while the main media focus is on his adulterous relationship with pornstars, the media eats it up and it’s disgusting. Don’t let any of these cheap veils the media is conveniently placing over your eyes distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer’s table.'
'You have it all wrong, it’s missing a comma;\n\nTrump says he wants to testify to Mueller, in Russia.'

'Mueller is one of the most patriotic bastards this country has ever given birth to. '
"Regardless of who it is they are the first domino.  So with that said, let's play r/politics favorite game: who's gonna be fucked on Monday! \n\nPossible candidates:\nManafort: if there's any person mueller has gone hard on the most, it's Pauly boy.  Alerting him of an indictment, uncovering past crimes, the fucking raid. It's truly a series of bad events for our mr manafucked.  \n\nFlynn:  he's been very quiet on Flynn these past few days, and most of the interviews he has done were with Flynn associates, so what's stopping him from laying the hammer of justice on him?  He's got all the markings of a traitor to be honest, more so than any other trump crony.\n\nTrump Jr.:  I always knew he was the worst of the children.  Look it's bad enough that the stories that he and the lawyer never matched so someone is fucking lying.  And obviously mueller isn't gonna arrest the Russian lawyer.  So he could be in big trouble.  \n\nThe other guys:\nA podesta grunt: he's gonna go after everyone eventually and this may be a guy of interest\n\nPage: while he is a small fry in the long run, he is the PERFECT voodoo doll for mueller to acquire.\n\nA bannon memeber: you can't tell me that these assholes aren't in trouble, they contacted Wikileaks for Christ sake, that's an enemy of the state! \n\nA congressman.  There's always that possibility that nunes is truly fucked...."
"Trump is not just the problem. He's also a symptom. \n\nMy generation fucked all this up. I'm a baby boomer. Fortunately, young adults are overwhelmingly opposed to the GOP in general and Trump in particular. \n\nPlease register to vote if you haven't, and vote for candidates who seem to be at least 50% of what you want. Keep voting for the right imperfect people, and things WILL change. You will send the right message over and over again. This is now a protracted mission rather than one battle."
'b-b-but fake news\n\nb-b-but deep state\n\nb-b-but witch hunt'
"Just think of the millions of dollars in tax payer money Republicans have spent on Hillary Clinton over the years with Zero indictments. That's not even including the $100 million they spent to uncover a consensual blowjob. \n\nIn 9 moths Mueller is handing out the first of many indictments. \n\nThe GOP used BinLaden as a boogieman for 8 years to strip personal freedoms. Democrats just killed him and moved on. The GOP used Hillary as a political bogieman for 20 years, Mueller just does the job and brings charges. It's the difference between reality and propaganda. News and Fake News."
'Mueller\'s spokesman must be pissed! "Just when I got used to saying \'no comment\' over and over, they go ahead and file indictments." '
'I think it\'s going to be Manafort, but I want to highlight one piece of evidence that points towards Donald Trump Jr and/or Prince Jared also being indicted:  the resignation on Friday of Dana Boente.\n\nExecutive Order 13769 issued by Trump changed the order of succession for the Department of Justice.  It is now (1) Deputy Atty General Rod Rosenstein, (2) Associate Atty General Rachel Brand, (3) US Atty for Eastern District of Virginia Dana Boente, (4) US Atty for Northern District of Illinois (currently vacant).\n\nIf Trump goes through a "Saturday Night Massacre", he may fire Sessions, Rosenstein and Brand in that order.  Boente would be next, but having tendered his resignation may no longer be qualified to take office.  Fourth in line is a vacant office (does the acting USA take office?).\n\nIn summary, I think Boente resigned because he sees a Saturday Night Massacre coming and doesn\'t want to get any blood on his hands, or wants to give Brand cover to fire Mueller (e.g., "I have to fire him because otherwise the DOJ will be in chaos without a leader..")\n\nA Saturday Night Massacre will come if Mueller indicts a Trump or Kushner; Trump won\'t take the political hit for Manafort or Flynn.'
"You know when Manafort is arrested wearing a fake mustache trying to board a plane to Switzerland, he'll claim it's a Halloween costume."
'The White House and the red hats are all in a mad panic. This is absolutely beautiful.'
"Oh shiiiiiit!! It's about to go down. Go get those fuckers Mueller!"
'Not American. Does this mean your rapist president will be indicted? Kushner will be pulled from under the rock he slithered under? \n\nFrom the outside looking in. You guys should have been here well before Mueller.'

'The story as reported elsewhere is that the Dutch lawyer who just plead guilty to lying to the FBI panicked when he learned his firm might be in legal jeopardy.

"Why isn't the news talking about this instead of yammering on about Kim Jung and the China visit. \n\nI mean isn't this pretty clear cut that Trump's campaign (Gates particularly) has now been shown to be talking to the Russians, a spy no less, during the campaign. "

'I have to wonder if Manafort is going to be facing even more charges around conspiracy and violating election laws.  And.. espionage?

">Can we call them Fake Memos?\n\nUsually Trump doesn't hesitate in calling something FAKE news. The fact that this time he poised it as a question (a common 'I never said that' ploy) suggests he is beginning to realize that he might be called on his on BS. "
'This is the top "hot" link right now here on r/politics, followed immediately thereafter by "Kushner Cos. filed false documents with NYC."\n\nEverything Trump accuses others of doing, he and his criminal family are already doing the same thing and have been doing so for a long time.'
'It is fitting that “Why so serious?” was asked ten years ago, I remember I was restless; simply awaiting the next comic book film to release, talking comics, fishing, working out, I did not care about the future. I wasn’t serious about anything. I saw the world at war and thought everything was a joke. I had no interest in politics. The main thing I knew was The Dark Knight was out and how awesome it was. It is common knowledge that adults and youth at the time were obsessed with the portrayal of a character in comic book mythos: The Joker. As an anarchist, he proceeded to carve a path through the fictional city of Gotham. At one point The Joker asked with a silent, roaring intensity “Why, so serious?”. In that moment, a question became a statement that defined an entire generation.\n\nThat statement, while fictionally-sourced, struck a nerve worldwide and the apathetic nature it evoked can be seen to this day. However, that was never enough for me. In those ten years I sailed around the world as a United States Sailor, was trained by arguably the best Intel community in the world, worked towards my degree in International Politics, worked with both the United Nations and World Bank as an independent consultant. The world was not what I was led to believe. With that in mind I then started to look at America like I did everywhere else. What I found disturbed me.\n\nIn 2011 I left the Republican party as there was only so many times I could have been told that (insert elected official) was coming for my guns and all the other hateful rhetoric Fox “news” spread. That hateful rhetoric that is still here. In the last three years I cannot impress upon you enough how many variations of the phrase “Fuck your feelings snowflake.” I have heard. Vile racist behavior is out in the open and when confronted, you will hear variations of the same thing “It was just a joke” and “Why so serious?”\n\nI sat back as opinion somehow became “facts”. I also saw fear and misinformation win with little effort. I saw a charlatan, clear as day, use that fear and misinformation to galvanize an electorate. I watched as, then Presidential nominee, Trump mocked a gold star family. I watched as, then Presidential nominee, Trump mocked a disabled reporter. I watched, as then Presidential nominee, Trump mocked American Prisoners of War (POWs). I watched and brought up these articles, sources (1-42), and was ridiculed for my efforts. Then James Comey was fired and obstruction was introduced into the game. The President of the United States told Russians that his firing of Comey would ease up pressure on them. The President of the United States also verbally assaulted the FBI and James Comey through twitter. James Comey testified and gave evidence that The President of The United States asked him to drop his investigation into Mike Flynn. In not doing so, James Comey and the FBI were, again, verbally assaulted by The President of The United States. (43,44)\n\nEven with all this going on, The President of The United States still had time to continue to lie that one of our biggest trade partners is sending over only rapists, killers and criminals. Stating that they are going to pay for a wall on our border. He also actively called them “our enemy” when they have never been. In doing this, Trump not only gave credence to the idiots of this country to believe that those of Latin descent were in fact criminal, he also strained relations with the government of Mexico.\n\nThe President of The United States has further alienated our other allies to the point of exclusion from deals with the European Union, as we are now seen as an unreliable ally. The EU also began to form their first army due to Americas actions. We are losing on trade deals and that will negatively affect our economy. Making matters interesting is our allies saying it has been easier to reach better deals without America involved. What happens to America when the world moves on without us? Also, let’s not forget the Human Rights Watch has openly singled out Trump for his encouraging oppression. [52]\n\nAt this point I am not even halfway through everything this administration has done and yet, even to this day, it continues. This last Friday The President of The United States ordered the Attorney General to fire the second FBI director investigating him. After months of The President of The United States attacking his own Intelligence Community and Department of Justice.\n\n“Chuck, it is serious.” Senator Patrick Leahy’s hand-written note said. Three simple and yet for some excruciatingly hard to say words, it. is. serious. I feel like many of us have said those words numerous times since 2015. That three years feel like a lifetime ago is a testament to how exhausting it is. The last decade has been a whirlwind in that sense.\n\nIn this decade, I have witnessed all of this and spoke up, only to be asked (and to paraphrase what Pat and others have said many times to me) “Why so serious?”. For over ten years I have heard that statement, that question, and let it go unanswered. Allow me to rectify that mistake. Why so serious? It is because The President of The United States is a Russian asset.\n\nEdit: fixed wording on quote - bullhorn_bigass thank you also love the name.'

'Its an age old tactic for investigations at this level.  It really is. You leak shit yourself and then bitch about the prosecution.\n\nThey talked about this in the beginning when some things leaked, noting that their would be absolutely zero reason for the prosecutor to leak that particular info. It wouldnt put the screws on anyone. It didnt correct any misinfo in the media. It didnt help their case at all.. but the defense, it would help them in their claims that the prosecution is dirty.\n\nAnd take note though, the GOP having a hissy fit over leaks just like they freaking out over that commedian, meanwhile nunes fights with theri own justice department to get the secret memo that launched the investigation and immediately leaked it. Same with the fisa request. And also did that communication way in the beginning that he said proved obama illegally tapped trump, when it was a tap on a foreigner.\n\nwanna bet if we count more leaks come from their side? just like it was from bush during the run up to the iraqi war as they bitched about leaks, while simultaneously selectively leaking shit from the intelligence community while hiding other shit that disagreed.

'Everybody missed this during Sarah Fberg\'s presser yesterday, but there was a big paradigm shift in talking points:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/h5G4EtM0kJs?t=910\n\n\nIt seems to me that SHS is saying that Trump believes IC ~~community~~ that Russia interfered in election, but that doesn\'t mean "he participated in it...  Those are two very different things.  Stating something happened is very different than having helped make it happen".\n\nTrump has *always* questioned the IC assessment that Russia interfered in the election; and he\'s been very vocal about corruption in IC.\n\nBut now the message is shifting to "Look.  It happened.  But he didn\'t help."  SHS didn\'t even include wording that denied trump\'s knowledge of the interference.\n\nThis is a big change in the talking points.  Signals that they know some big news is coming, but Trump is going to deny personal involvement in any "collusion".  (Conspiracy to commit crimes against the US is the wording I prefer.)\n\n*And, now we know why the message has shifted:\n\n[Senate panel to release interviews with Trump Jr., others involved in meeting with Russian lawyer](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/senate-judiciary-committee-to-release-transcripts-of-interviews-with-trump-tower-meeting-participants/2018/01/25/3f8f12a0-01e3-11e8-bb03-722769454f82_story.html?hpid=hp_no-name_no-name%3Apage%2Fbreaking-news-bar&utm_term=.ebcca464b712)\n\nI\'d hazard a guess that Session\'s recent interview with Mueller also helped change strategy.\n'

'I\'d be surprised if we didn\'t see an indictment tomorrow.  And not someone small like Papadopoulos.  Someone large, like Nunes, Trump Jr, or Trump\'s attorney.\n\nThere are two response the GOP will have the moment the knowledge a GOP politician has been indicted.\n\n- They will turn on themselves like piranhas.  It will be a skeleton outing of the highest order.  Trump will suddenly be persona non grata for the GOP.  The interest will be in saving their own hides and pushing each other infront of Mueller, "I may have done this but Bob here....Bob did something even worse!"\n\nOr\n\n- They will attempt a final assault on the integrity of the US judicial system.  Mueller will be fired or attempted to be blocked legislatively.  Mouth pieces will rail against the attempted coup by Mueller and try to get riots and violent action by their supports.\n\nWhich one we get is largely dependent on who Mueller starts with.  Targeting someone like Nunes will bring out the former as he has been providing nothing but headaches for the GOP.  Someone like McConnell or Ryan would provoke the latter.  However, with the calls from Dent and other GOP congressmen to lay off the character assassination of the FBI, they may be sabotaging any attempt to successfully pull of the latter option without devolving into an even bigger rush to confess.\n\nKeep in mind, I\'m looking at Congress as a bunch of children who know the teacher/parent is about to lay down punishments.  They are going to try to deflect to someone they know is guilty in an attempt to escape.  When they know something big is coming and they can\'t lie or avoid the coming fury, the goal is to minimize your punishment by sacrificing a friend/sibling/frenemy.'
"I can't believe I'm reading this about the US of all countries.

A shining city on the hill in your terms. It's been downhill since Gingrich but I never thought I would see Republicans defend treason and corruption so blatantly and worse, see the electorate cheer them on. \n\nIts all just so depressing. Even if Trump is deposed, there's been so much damage to America's moral authority over the past twenty years.\n\nAnd I still admire you as a people. But damn it if you aren't making it very hard. "

Mind boggling. '
"My nightmare scenario is that trump is charged but nobody on the right does anything. Mass protests and outrage ensues and trump uses that as a means of clamping down and removing rights. There's a scenario somewhere in there that is worse than where we are now. "
"I have a feeling that while Trump and his immediate cronies will be dethroned from this, that GOP by in large will walk away unscathed.\n\nThey will simply claim ignorance. Once the hammer starts to fall, they'll turn on the Trump administration, and claim they were there the whole time. And their sycophantic, mindless drones will lap up every word. Because voting GOP isn't voting FOR the GOP, it's voting AGAINST the democrats with their abortion for everybody and taking god out of church.\n\nThat way even the every-day churchgoing catholic 80 year old grandmother of 20 can justify to herself she didn't vote for the wrong person. Trump may have been misogynistic. He may have been a non-believer. He may have been anti-american. He may have been screwing a porn star after his 3rd wife after she gave birth... But, goddamnit, he wouldn't appoint any pro-abortion judges!\n\nWhen what you're fighting against in your view is child murder. You can justify anything.

'I have to believe Mueller has a dead man switch. There must be a report with all his findings ready to be released in the event of his firing. '
'Just a little casual treason, no biggie but remember when Obama wore a tan suit? That shit was outrageous.'
'Trump cannot not fire Mueller eventually. He is obviously guilty as shit, not only of obstruction (not 100% sure of the collusion yet) but of decades of financial crimes. Whatever the blowback might be from firing Mueller is still worth it when he simply cannot allow the investigation to finish.'
'Now that Mueller knows he was going to be fired, Trump will use THAT as the reason of Mueller\'s conflict of interest. \n\n"How can he be impartial when he knows I wanted to fire him?  Also Hillary!"'

Even as a European it's disgusting and frustrating seeing this kind of abuse of power go unpunished, so I cannot even imagine how you are feeling.\n\nIf he really does fire Mueller, you have to react. Go to the streets, show them you don't fear them and that you demand change. And show them that nobody is above the law.\n\nHere in Europe we don't blame the American people for what's happening. We blame Donald Trump, the GOP members that cover for him, the neo-nazi/racist groups and Trump supporters that turn a blind eye.\n\nTake the USA back from these greedy assholes!\nStay strong my American friends!"

They’ve all but cleared them of colluding with Russia as it slowly trickles all that Mueller wants to question him on is Comey and Flynn. Which is flimsy and likely to not be anything able to be pursued as Trump can fire anyone in a nominated office he chooses...and people act like comey was investigating alone, it didn’t stop the investigation at all...and the facts are still essentially what Comey told him: he’s not under investigation for collusion. \n\nThe day he proposes sweeping historic immigration reform, putting on the table citizenship for 1.8M people. 1,800,000 people. Three times the population of Vermont...and then this comes out to distract people from what he’s trying to accomplish again. I am no fan of the person trump is, but I am sickened by the media using allegations of discussions months ago to take people’s eyes off the fact that progress is being made...president racist wants to give citizenship to 1,800,000 people that the left will have you believe he despises. \n\n/end rant.

'What I’m wondering is, considering how silent / complicit the GOP has been over the insane list of things Trump has done; Mueller has likely dug up nasty shit on them as well. \n\nWhile the scope of investigation has been Trump & the election; if the disease is far deeper, how would he handle that?

"To bad they didn't foresee a whole party willing to throw away the constitution to enrich themselves and the companies, wealthy individuals donating to them.\n\nAt some point the US needs to move past the whole 200 years ago some people foresaw and put in place restrictions. blah blah blah.\n\nWhat is required is an overhaul of the system. Move away from a two party governship. Move away from an system that allows states with 10x less people have equal or more representation. Move away from constitutional rights that need to be replaced if not removed as they have no merit in the current world. Perhaps even move away from a presidency that allows so much control without opposition and a presidency where they run based on party rather as individuals without party affiliation.\n\nAt this point, i think the only way the rest of the world will be willing to take the US seriously again, is going to require a lot of changes to the US system. As the US has proven that it cannot be trusted to even elect a sane president, but they cannot be trusted to uphold and sustain partnerships and treaties and deals beyond the term limits of the present presidents political party."

The man’s face looks it’s decaying from trying and failing, to hold all the evil inside the human shaped meat sack.  \n\nEven if you agreed with all of his abhorrent policies, I still can’t believe people looked at him and went “This is most certainly a well put together and healthy individual! He most certainly does not look like the human equivalent of a Hellmouth!”'
'They warned us and put mechanisms in place but we have to rely on people to activate them. The first line of defense was the fucking electoral college which utterly failed. '
"I'm sorry but as long as it's 'former' this or 'former' that, it doesn't really bloody matter. He doesn't listen to anyone but he's sure as hell not gonna listen to a 'former' something.\n\nUntil someone currently in a position of power tells him to shut the fuck up then chances are he's going to go on his stupid impulses and fire Mueller.\n\nOf course, then the sealed indictments come into play, along with state charges in NY and hopefully it causes enough disruption that congress reinstates Mueller to carry on because Trump will have proven he's guilty as sin.\n\nI mean, he's guilty as sin so he's trying to save his own skin but the truth always comes out eventually. Especially you're as monumentally stupid as Trump is."
"Trump is legendarily stupid.  He fired Comey and everything went from a 5 to a 10.  He is still too stupid to put together the correlation there, that firing Comey directly led to the appointment of Mueller.\n\nHe WILL fire Mueller at some point, or publicly try to.  And it will take it from a 10 to a 50.  He's just too fucking stupid to understand."
'For all the people suggesting our forefathers failed:\n\nThe correction comes from our vote. The one true power we have over our elected officials, and is a right our forefathers fought and died for. We begin this correction in November and is how America works. If Donald does nothing more than inspire better people to get into politics, and win, then we will be stronger in the end. \n\nAlso, generational polling is the worst it has been in polling ***history*** for the GOP. Their future is bleak as hell and GOP leadership knows this. '
"Our forefathers might have plan for somebody like Trump, but the citizenry at-large is still continuing to fail from removing him from office.\n\n I mean seriously we can talk for days about the list of things this guy's done wrong, was unconstitutional, as a threat to not just the average American but the world as a whole ( remember his nuclear comments) but hey let's just keep bitching about Donald Trump on our politics because that's going to affect real change!"
'Too bad the electoral college failed to realize their purpose of existing when they went ahead and voted for him anyway.'
'I am heartened by the American political system. It is remarkably resilient.\n\nThe system was designed to work against a pandering demagogue like DJT.\n\nFirst, it was designed to ensure he didn\'t win the election. And it came close, but ultimately failed in that regard.\n\nThen you have Congress and the federal courts. Republicans in Congress have essentially doubled down on Trump\'s "populism", thinking it\'s easier to deal with him now and just consider him an ambulatory hand to sign their legislation into law, as opposed to rejecting him and all he stands for, as they should have done to maintain their last vestiges of credibility.\n\nBut as Congress has failed (until November...), the courts have stepped up, over things like his Muslim ban, DACA, EPA regulations, and several other major policy areas. They have checked his worst excesses, exactly as they were meant to.\n\nThis is why, even after all this shit and everything that\'s happened over the past ~15 months, I am optimistic for the future.\n\nThe system is working, and it is blocking or delaying Trump where it matters most. And no amount of Tweets is going to change that.\n\nBut the people have to do their part. Vote in November. Vote in every election from now until the end of time. Vote the Republicans into the Dark Ages for inflicting this shit on us and enabling such a wholly unqualified and unsuitable person to be president. Make them regret it over and over and over again.\n\nThen and only then can we say that the problem has been resolved. '
'The fact that he can pardon everyone indicted, fire the guy investigating him, and cannot be charged with any crime unless the opposite party is in charge of Congress means they did a fucking shitty job planning for him.'
"Forefathers planned for you...yet he still gets elected, is still in office, is still not impeached. Not trying to jab here, but if they did plan for this, it failed and his presidency shouldn't be left to the forefathers, but people living currently to handle it."
'Well, they tried, but that failed spectacularly. \n\nAlexander Hamilton on the electoral college:\n"the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications."\n\n'
'Every time I see someone warning Trump not to make a mistake it’s  or wrong decision it comes with the title of “former” we can listen to these former government officials who are now private citizens all day long. Wake up! It’s the people in office **now**. Trump disregards current people in government. We already know if he fires Mueller there will be backlash, from the people. But not by the government. Both Dems and Reps will go about how they tend to. The left will criticize Trump and the right will ignore it and move on. We’re not operating on normal ethical etiquette here. We’re running on Trump’s. It’s been more than a year. How long will it take people to figure this out already. The man has been apart of scandal week in week out. Things have changed. Politics have changed. Ethics for being president have changed.'

Van Der Swaan was charged with a criminal information, which **typically precedes a guilty plea**.\n\nSo he was brought in 4 days ago and looks to already pleading out. \n\nEdit 3, this is what the GOP will be focusing on today:\n\n>Paul Manafort was involved in recruiting Skadden to prepare the report on behalf of Ukraine, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg News. **The Skadden team was headed by Gregory Craig, a partner who had worked as President Barack Obama’s White House counsel from 2009 to 2010 and for President Bill Clinton during his impeachment.**'

If the purpose of the Russian meddling was to cause disunity and dissension amongst Americans .. haven't they already succeeded ? It seems there is no coming back from this and the further this thing goes the more divided our country will become. For Americans, this is entirely a no-win situation right ?\n\nI could see a future candidate being very successful by running on a strong anti-Russian campaign, which will inevitably lead to more proxy wars which is what both Democrats and Republicans want anyways. \n\nNo matter what happens Americans lose. Fuck it all . I'm going back to apathy and jaded observation.  "
'Mueller\'s team is phenomenal at acquiring everything they need as evidence, unbeknownst to the suspects and witnesses they interview. In this case they uncovered or otherwise became aware of "surreptitiously recorded calls" and apparently deleted emails that were omitted in conversation by Zwaan.\n\nTo think  that this incredibly tangled web of international fraud and deceit by so many parties would\'ve remained unnoticed were it not for Trump getting elected (whether or not many of these are directly related, it is the basis for Mueller\'s wide-reaching probe).

He has to really be wondering how he could have been the only ethically, morally and criminally clean member of his family and his circle of associates. It has to be like a bad dream.  His whole world view is crumbling.

"Most people on reddit are too young to have seen it first hand, but the difference between this investigation and the Starr investigation against Clinton could not be more different.

'Everyone start calling Trump a pussy for using lawyers in this situation. He will hop on Twitter in a fury and drop his legal counsel to show you all Trump ain’t no chump!'
"OK, I know it's tempting to want a courtroom showdown, with all the drama.  To want to see Trump bluster and make an ass our of himself, and refuse to comment, and then maybe to make a mistake and admit wrongdoing.\n\nThat's not what we really want.  We want Mueller and his team to be able to build their case.  We want clear, concise answers about what happened.  We don't want a media circus, we don't want Fox News rallying the idiots with their sound bites and cried of UNFAIR.\n\nWe want boring.\n\nWe want Mueller's team to submit questions in writing, we want LAWYER OK'd responses from Trump, and we want this to go on until Mueller is done.  No surprises, no drama, no room for Trump to scream UNFAIR, etc."
"There are no options here. If Trump refuses to sit down for an interview with Mueller, the grand jury will subpoena him and force him to answer questions under oath. Trump will of course be unable to stop himself from lying. There will be no written response. There will be no signed affidavit from Trump saying he's innocent."
'You want to pay off the national debt and pay for these tax cuts? You pay per view that testimony live. '
'Trump may be able to make a case that a face to face interview would be unfair do to his pathological inability to tell the truth.'

'Mueller: "So Mr. Priebus, it says here that if you remove all the vowels from your name you\'re left with RNC PR BS"\n\nReince: "I\'m sorry I thought I was here to talk about Trump?"\n\nMueller: "...what the hell kinda name is \'Reince\' anyways??"'
'I still think Priebus is deep in.\n\nHe was the Chair of the GOP when Trump injected his weird pro-Russian change into the GOP platform.\n\nAnd then everybody pretended they had no idea how it happened.\n\nBut sure as shit the Chair of the GOP knew. And then he became Chief of Staff.'
'Well that should bring some horror to Trump this Friday Oct. 13. \n\nThen again I have been terrified all day.'
'Nice. This week has been so lame with no bombshell leaks. '
'Can’t wait for the twitter update. Hope this ends soon and we get these shitheads sent to prison. '
'So I’m just going to lay this out there. I hate to say it but this all means diddly squat if Congress does nothing with it. And from what I’ve seen, these cowards (aka Republicans) aren’t going to accept anything Mueller’s report says. All Donny has to say (and has already said) is that this is a Fake Investigation that’s trying to return control to the swamp. And his little minions will believe it. Bannon will double down on anyone who steps out of line therefore, hardly anyone will. \n\nSeriously the ONLY hope we have as a country to survive this mess is to vote vote vote in every election that we can. And while we can maybe never actually trust the validity of any election again, that’s all we have to maintain some semblance of the democracy we once knew. If the Democrats can pull it off in 2018 and again in 2020, we may can get off this horrible ride. If not, I’m not sure we will ever get back on track. '
'I hate to throw cold water on all of this, but Reince Priebus is a well-known coward who only exists to serve the GOP. Anyone with even half a testicle who had been humiliated the way Reince had would absolutely tell Mueller everything he knew. Sadly, Rience lost his balls a long time ago if he ever had any to begin with. '
"Is it bad that even between Trump's moves to cancel ACA subsidies and decertify the Iran deal, that all I could wonder was what crazy Russia news was going to drop this weekend?\n\nTheir attempts at distraction are just sad at this point."
"priebus is a bitch, he won't sell out trump even though trump wipes his ass with him."
"Oh shit! Mueller comin'!"
"**This is a copy of a comment I made earlier. Please, if you can go, go. Share the link below with everyone, it's now or never. If we don't let our government know that we will not stand for this any longer, it will be too late.**\n\nThere is a mass protest planned accross the country on Nov. 4th and it's supposed to go on everyday until Trump resigns or is kicked out of office. \n\nCrazy alt-right people are absolutely losing their minds, claiming this is the radical left or antifa planning to start a civil war on the 4th. Thanks to Alex Jones. They are even calling for everyone to get their guns and be ready. Anyone who can protest should, but be very careful. Hopefully these people are all talk. \n\n**Link to website with more info/resources on protest:**\n[Refusefascism.org](https://refusefascism.org/protests-and-events/)\n\nEDIT: seriously guys, GO PROTEST. For some reason the news of this protest has been slow to spread, I just learned about it yesterday and I actively look for events like this to go to. It looks like it's getting suppressed and there is a mountain of fake news surrounding it. I thought it was not even a real event when I first heard of it, I thought the right was just losing their minds over a fake story or something. Go to YouTube and search Nov. 4th or Nov. 4th protest, and the only thing you will see is hundreds of crazy Trump people, INCLUDING POLICE OFFICERS telling you to be afraid and arm yourselves because the left are about to come murder you. It's absolutely insane. \n\nWe need to show the world there is more of us than there are of them. Stay peaceful and spread the word! "
'Is it me or is trumps pattern so predictable now. He picks a fight with the media. Signs or tweets something outrageous then something new about Muellers investigation is revealed. So this week. \n\n1. Says he hates the first amendment. \n\n2. Sabotages Obamacare via EO\n\n3.  Followed by this story \n\nWhen trump signed the Obamacare EO I was expecting something new about Mueller being revealed. '

'Yet his supporters will go on about how distracting it is from the presidency and how many millions are being wasted. Fuck off.

Where are the WaPo stories and r/politics posts about that?'

'I know Mueller has a huge investigation on his hands but man this is taking a very long time. The longer Trump is president the more damage he will do'
'Of COURSE Russians funded Trump.  \n\nThe thing to understand about Russian oligarchs is how they view democracy.  Any movement "of the people, by the people, for the people" Threatens their  power; democratic societies were designed to undermine oligarchs. \n\nTheir number one enemy is a democratic society.  This 2015 piece from *Time* describes it in better words than I can:\n\n>Russia invaded Ukraine not to halt a “military coup,” as President Putin rather oddly claimed on Monday, but to hinder a democratic movement by military action. In Syria, Russia has helped and presumably will continue to help Assad repress all resistance, not just the Islamicist variety.\n\n>From Moscow’s perspective, there is not much difference between university students protesting in Kyiv for closer ties with the European Union and Islamicist terrorists gaining ground in Syria. In both cases, Russian leaders can, quite understandably, see a coming domestic problem. If people can gather peacefully in Kyiv, why not in Moscow? If Islamic terrorism can work in Syria, why not in southern Russia?\n\n>But the more important factor is domestic public opinion. Russia is a television culture, and Russian television news is devoted almost entirely to the world beyond Russia. In the last few days, Russian television has completely changed the subject: from Ukraine to Syria. What must not be mentioned is that Russia has not achieved its goals in Ukraine. The Ukrainian war shows that Russia can fail even when the European Union pays only a very small amount of attention to the conflict. What Russian leaders seem to want in Syria is a war without EU sanctions, which they can win for the viewers at home.\n\n[source](http://time.com/4054941/putin-russia-syria/)'
"More GOP early retirements on the way. Add this to Cambridge Analytica using stolen data to push targeted GOP/Russian propaganda to millions. It isn't just that the GOP doesn't have a spine, they are directly complicit. The only way to hold them accountable is to vote them out.  "

'With the Russian intervention in Ukraine in 2014 (de facto occupying Crimea; they came in, forced the crimean legislative assembly under arms to hold a "referendum" generally not acknowledged as a free election, then "russian volunteers" started an "uprising" in Donbass), Barack Obama had one of his weakest points as President. The intelligence services were not prepared for the scenario, and Obama tried a soft approach, where a hardline stance was needed against Putin. Ever since, the ukrainians have gotten increasingly more international support; but with this limitation: everything was under non-lethal aid classification: training, equipment, counter-battery radars etc. The one red line that was never crossed; arms supplies.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd **this** is where we see Donald "I love Putin" Trump put down his only move that is directly harmful to russian interests, that differ from Obama. He sends them the one thing, the one weapon system they have above all others been asking for: a gamechanger in warfare against the "seperatists"\'s russian-supplied tanks (spoiler alert; they\'re russians and russian stooges). Donald Trump just committed the most overt obstruction we have evidence of. He bought the ukrainian\'s silence with weapons of war. This needs to be shouted loud from every rooftop.\n\n**This. Is. Obstruction.**\n'

'In case you\'re wondering, yes.  \n\nYes, that\'s a shit load of subpoenas / witnesses for one criminal case.  \n\nIf I\'m his attorney, I\'m begging for a plea deal.  But at this point, I\'m not sure there\'s any reason Mueller would offer him one.\n\nEdit:  I agree with the lawyer below me.  I initially read this article as these 70 "being in addition" to the original 35 subpoenas that were issued.  I consider 70 total still a very high number for a *criminal* case, but not unheard of in a complex white collar case, and not the over 100, I originally based this post on.  \n\nObviously, the more paper evidence involved in the case, the more subpoenas.\n\nSo you do generally get more subpoenas issued in white collar cases than crimes of violence, for example.\n\nNone of this changes the fact that if this goes to trial, Manafort will die in prison.  Although he may find that preferable to the risk of he or his kids being suicided if he flips.\n'

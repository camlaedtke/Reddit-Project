Russia favored Trump in 2016 election, Senate Intelligence Committee says, breaking with House GOP
'Huge shoutout to NYT for some awesome reporting during this entire Trump Presidency. They are playing a legitimate role in saving our democracy. '
'I have been a student of history. And honestly I don’t remember a Congress in recent history that wouldn’t have been up in arms against such a president. Instead we have a congress where republicans are going out of their way to not only defend this sham of a presidency but attacking the men and women of intelligence agencies that are the frontline defense for the security of this country. This is the polar opposite of making America great.  This is Putin’s check. Will it become checkmate is what should scare every decent American, patriot or otherwise. '
"It's worth noting... \n\nThere's likely a *very* good reason we haven't heard about this, until now. \n\nMost of the big leaks regarding Trump and this investigation have been carefully timed. I'm sure it's no coincidence that we're hearing this the day after Trump leaves the country"
'Every person commenting better have subscribed to a newspaper of some sort. A free (and financially supported!) press is one of the greatest weapons we have against tyranny. '
"To all who is guilding this post, please consider subscribing to the Times. We need to support this kind of journalism and they've earned it."
'>Ty Cobb, who manages the White House’s relationship with Mr. Mueller’s office, said in a statement, “We decline to comment out of respect for the Office of the Special Counsel and its process.”\n\nTranslation: please, please, please use lube'
'The free press is literally going to be responsible for saving our republic. God bless them. They don’t get enough praise or credit. '
"> After receiving the president’s order to fire Mr. Mueller, the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, refused to ask the Justice Department to dismiss the special counsel, saying he would quit instead, the people said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing a continuing investigation.\n\n\nI'm impressed by McGahn for the first time."
'Honestly this entire debacle has really helped shape my life. I was a listless young adult and I’m now chasing a law degree and wanting to get involved in politics. I apply to uva and William and Mary in the fall. Wish me luck...'
"Honestly I'm not surprised, I didn't think Mueller would get this far. Good on the lawyers"
"I hope young people are paying attention to this. This is something you'll be talking about well into your adulthood. Believe it or not, one day you'll know people much younger than yourselves who were not around to witness this, or are too young to remember. You'll be the person they ask about this when they're doing their homework, or learning about it generally.\n\nIt's one of the best things about getting older. Keep these details and developments in your mind."
">WASHINGTON — The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has subpoenaed the Trump Organization to turn over documents, including some related to Russia, according to two people briefed on the matter. The order is the first known time that the special counsel demanded documents directly related to President Trump’s businesses, bringing the investigation closer to the president.\n\n>The breadth of the subpoena was not clear, nor was it clear why Mr. Mueller issued it instead of simply asking for the documents from the company, an umbrella organization that oversees Mr. Trump’s business ventures. In the subpoena, delivered in recent weeks, Mr. Mueller ordered the Trump Organization to hand over all documents related to Russia and other topics he is investigating, the people said.\n\n>The subpoena is the latest indication that the investigation, which Mr. Trump’s lawyers once regularly assured him would be completed by now, will drag on for at least several more months. Word of the subpoena comes as Mr. Mueller appears to be broadening his investigation to examine the role foreign money may have played in funding Mr. Trump’s political activities. In recent weeks, Mr. Mueller’s investigators have questioned witnesses, including an adviser to the United Arab Emirates, about the flow of Emirati money into the United States.\n\nSo if they've had to resort to subpoenas, is it safe to assume the Special Counsel already requested the documents and were denied by the Trump Organization?\n\nEdit - from Ari Melber; Senior congressional source says that Mueller beginning with a subpoena, rather than typical document request, suggests special counsel intends to put every Trump Org staffer on alert not to destroy evidence."
'I love that the NYT is doing this right before Huckabee takes the podium.'
'I love that this comes out after the House Intelligence Committee Republicans closed their investigation\n\nFoot -> mouth. '
"If you think about it, Trump is a character worthy of his own shakespearean tragedy. Born with a silver spoon in his mouth, always trying to fill the void where his fathers love should have been. Someone who - if he had been humble enough to feel contend with what he had - would have had an easy life full of luxury most people could only dream of. But then he nearly loses everything he owns because of his ineptitude. Overcoming this by turning to the dark side even more, he craves fame. But fame isn't enough in the end, he needs to have respect, admiration and power as well. Which leads him to become the most powerful person in the world. Then, when he thinks he has it all, everything around him starts to crumble, every evil deed is being dragged into the light, every sin exposed. In the end, he has nothing again and tainted his family name forever.\n\nAssuming that it ends this way.\nI can almost picture the play. "
'Can we just take a moment to appreciate what Obama did to make this possible?  Allowing our intelligence services to communicate freely and share information most likely saved our democracy from tyranny.  He will go down as the most important President since Lincoln. '
'>Mr. Trump’s lawyers are in negotiations with Mr. Mueller’s office about whether and how to allow his investigators to interview the president. Mr. Mueller’s office has shared topics it wants to discuss with the president, according to two people familiar with the talks. **The lawyers have advised Mr. Trump to refuse an interview but the president wants to do it, as he believes he has done nothing wrong and can easily answer investigators’ questions.**\n\nNow this is just impressively stupid.'
"He subpoenaed documents he could just asked for.\n\nHe didn't bother asking and just subpoenaed them.\n\nWhich tells us, this is more assertive but also perhaps Trump associates have not been forth coming with what they have been asked to produce or be truthful about."
'It\'s kind of beautiful that the first subpoena directed at the Trump Organization is on the Ides of March. Google\'s definition is pretty funny: "it was marked by several religious observances and notable for the Romans as a deadline for settling debts."'
"Mueller doesn't give a crap about crossing any red line, because there isn't any. He has broad authority to investigate any matters arising. he is zero afraid of the investigation being terminated, and is acting as if he has zero fear of that. he is not stepping on egg shells. he is being strategic with his subpoenas and indictments, but he's not cow-towing.    \n\nit makes me think he's got something that can stop Trump from actually shutting it down or trying to shut it down. not sure what that would be unless he's also friends with Putin and they've been sharing as well. or he has such a good back up plan it won't matter (protected off-shore data vault, numerous state AG's having copies of evidence, etc etc.)"
'Happy Infrastructure Week!'
">The lawyers\xa0have advised Mr. Trump to refuse an interview but the president wants to do it, as he believes he has done nothing wrong and can easily answer investigators’ questions.\n\nOh please please please do it. Feed your ego by going in there thinking you're smarter than Mueller. I hope there's video released if it ever happens. "

"I don't ask for much, but PLEASE someone make this happen."
'Tillerson has a degree in Civil Engineering and is the former CEO of 2 massive organizations. \n\nTrump is a trust fund baby that got lucky...gee I wonder who wins. '
"Not that Trump would actually take them up on this, but if he did it's pretty clear how it would turn out.\n\nWhile taking the test, Trump would get frustrated and feel out of his depth, prompting him to just up and leave right in the middle.  He'll play both sides and complain about how it was unfair but also that he would have scored very high if he actually finished it.  He doesn't have the aptitude or the attention span for a test like that.\n\nWhy would we expect him to do anything less?  That is his playbook for uncomfortable interviews and meetings.  Why on earth would he act any differently when taking an honest to god exam?"
'> “I think it\'s fake news,” Trump told the magazine of Tillerson’s “moron” remark, “but if he did that, I guess we\'ll have to compare IQ tests. And **I can tell you who is going to win**."\n\nTo be honest, Trump didn\'t say *he\'d* win, only he knew who would win. \n\nSo Trump was honest: Tillerson would win, and he knows it! '
"Smart people don't have to tell anyone that they're smart.\n\nIf someone is truly intelligent, everyone around them already know it."
'Trump would get stumped on the first puzzle, I have zero doubt. And not even one of the hard ones, just the ones where they give you some sticks and ask you to make as many triangles as possible. \n\nHe would just make one big triangle and then claim he had actually beat the test because no one had thought to make one big triangle. “It was a tremendous triangle, believe me. And the testers and the scientists, they were just amazed, and standing around cheering, and saying no one had ever thought of that. Not even the people who had designed the test thought of that. You have all of these genius psychologists, and none of them were smart enough to realize that one big triangle was actually how you win the test. “'

'Roy Moore liked this night a lot better when it was younger!'
"As a 21-year-old black kid who hadn't paid attention to politics in the slightest bit until Donald Trump became president. This is some of the happiest news I've ever woken up from a nap to see in my entire life. Thanks to the black voters that turned out and swung this election around. Thanks to Alabama for doing the right thing. And the BIGGEST middle finger to Donald Trump for supporting Roy Moore. Hold this L my guy. "
"Before we all head off for the night, can we agree to drink to the fine folks in Alabama who turned out to vote with such strength they swung the state blue to protect America from Roy Moore? Y'all did something amazing today."
'I’m so fucking proud of my state! I knew it, I knew we could do it! For weeks I’ve seen people saying Moore would win, that Alabama is a bunch of bible thumbing hicks, but tonight I’m proud to say I’m from Alabama!'
'<<"It’s not over,” Moore said. He added, “We know that God is still in control.” >>   Ah the hubris in believing that you know the mind of God, and the vulgarity of making God in your own image.

"On the off chance there are any Republicans from Alabama that read this comment -- if you held your nose and voted for Jones instead of Moore, thank you. If you have a family member that did this, thank them for me.\n\nThis weird little election represented the country, I am glad that you made this choice -- you see, you did what I had to do, what a lot of people had to do last election. A lot of us voted for Hillary and wanted almost anything but that. The only worse thing we could have imagined was Trump. We wanted someone to shake the system up too, we just thought Sanders was our man instead of Trump.\n\nI know the majority of people that voted for Clinton didn't feel that way, but I can speak for a *ton* of people that did. It sucks, but it had to be done. I'm sure you know what I mean. If you simply abstained from voting, same deal, thank you. We cannot have people like Moore representing the best country in the world.\n\nAnyway, I said all of that to say this -- get your normal human being republican ready to run next time, get out in mass numbers and vote that bastard in if you want. Just thank you thank you thank you from the bottom of my heart for not voting for this guy. Thank you.\n\nedit: I do not think Clinton is as bad as Moore. Jesus fuck people. Context. "
'Let us not go TOO far into celebration here.  Yes, Jones won and that\'s great.  But let\'s not forget who almost won.  Roy Moore has:\n\n\n\n-twice been removed from office as a judge for violating his oath of office\n-made overtly clear his belief that homosexuality should be a criminal offense\n-explicitly stated his belief that non Christians should not legally be allowed to serve public office\n-publically stated that America was better during the time of slavery\n- made clear his desire to repeal the constitutional amendments that granted women the right to vote and gays the right to marry.\n\n\n\n\nAnd on top of all that, he has been shown to be a sexual predator of young teenage girls.  \n\n\n\nAnd 46% of the voting public tonight thought he deserved to be in the SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n\n\nAnd as much as we are happy for a win, this is still a problem.   Don\'t think the headline is "Jones beats Moore".\n\n\n\nThe headline is "reasonably moderate and seemingly nice fellow runs against slavery apologist, right wing terrorist sympathizer and sexual predator of children in 2017 america, nearly loses"\n\n\n\nSo Yes, be happy Jones won.  But don\'t for a second forget that even in the 21st century, a man like Roy Moore can come within a hair\'s breath of being elected to the the United States Senate.\n\n\n\nAnd if it wasn\'t for the bravery of the women who stood up and took him on we\'dbe discussing the election victory of a racist slavery sympathizer.\n\n\n\nAnd that\'s still a very serious problem. \n\n'

'Good on the Democrats.  Trump needs to face up to the shit he causes and take responsibility.  '
"Can we just take a moment and remember that by this time during the 111th Congress they Enacted 14 major new laws. While the current 115th Congress has a total of 4 and shutdown the government in the same time.\n\nRepublicans fundamentally cannot govern because they don't believe in the federal government. They never add anything or improve anything just remove and strip mine until there is nothing left.\n\nI can't think of anything they add or want to improve at all, they would probably have preferred The Articles of Confederation."

'"Our first introduction to him was when we were at the dress rehearsal and half naked, changing into our bikinis,” Dixon told local media. “He just came strolling right in.

Thank you, and I was not sure, because, no you don\'t have to cover yourself up. I was caught in traffic coming from the airport and, let me tell you this, airports just aren\'t the same as they used to be. My father, he flew a lot, as a kid I remember flying a lot too, and other people they have told me that they too have flown many times over the years. And these airports, these guys, they\'re just pointing at empty plane roads. I can point, look right now, I\'m pointing at you miss who must be cold because you are pointing back at me. And these guys they would not let my diamond crested, and I know I\'m a bit late showing up here. But, these guys they were pointing at the plan road and they pointed my diamond crested solid baby teeth jet to the wrong airplane garage. And for 20 , 30 years now, my jet has had no trouble being pointed to the right garage. And my garage at home can fit three planes but, they can\'t point me to the right, but, my garage at home is just filled with 1,500 donkey kong arcade machines. And they can\'t point my plane to the right garage.

And this restaraunt has a golden M, and not many people know, because this is a secret but, I will tell you girls, I\'ll tell you this and you can quote me on this because I have said it and these things that I say I say true things. This golden M restaraunt changed it\'s name to fit my own name as they saw how much I enjoyed their food. This "Mac Donalds" and they saw me smiling, I have a beautiful smile, just look at me smiling at your perky breasts, those are lovely. And the french fries were lovely too, these little shoelace, with just the right amount of salt. I don\'t like too much salt, I am not salty. And they saw me smiling so much, and I said, you know, this meal, this meal here. This golden burger and fries and this pop, if I could have a transformer with this, this would make me happy. This would be Donalds Happy Meal. And you know, I bet because I am so influential and they enjoyed experiencing me and my presence there so much. I bet you that they use that idea and make it their own. But, know this, you, yes you who needs a better waxer, it was I that made the McDonald\'s Happy Meal, and if my jet had not been late and made me hungry, you would not be able to thank me for this wonderful idea that I thought of all on my own. So you\'re welcome. Now, are we getting this orgy started or what? I need to go back and see if I can get Bumblebee. '

'This is a great time to remember that the Wall Street Journal reported on the hush money paid to Karen McDougal 4 days before the 2016 election: [National Enquirer Shielded Donald Trump From Playboy Model’s Affair Allegation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/national-enquirer-shielded-donald-trump-from-playboy-models-affair-allegation-1478309380)\n\n> The company that owns the National Enquirer, a backer of Donald Trump, agreed to pay $150,000 to a former Playboy centerfold model for her story of an affair a decade ago with the Republican presidential nominee, but then didn’t publish it, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal and people familiar with the matter.\n> \n> The tabloid-newspaper publisher reached an agreement in early August with Karen McDougal, the 1998 Playmate of the Year. American Media Inc., which owns the Enquirer, hasn’t published anything about what she has told friends was a consensual romantic relationship she had with Mr. Trump in 2006. At the time, Mr. Trump was married to his current wife, Melania.\n> \n> Quashing stories that way is known in the tabloid world as “catch and kill.”\n\nThis would have been bombshell news in any other election, but the rest of the press completely ignored it.

">  And it highlights the potential legal and political danger that Mr. Cohen represents to Mr. Trump. Once the keeper of many of Mr. Trump’s secrets, Mr. Cohen is now seen as increasingly willing to consider cooperating with prosecutors.\n\nHe's definitely trying to cooperate and turn state's evidence, that much is clear.  What's unclear is if he'll get a plea deal.\n\nAlso, lol @ Rudy:\n\n> \nRudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, confirmed in a telephone conversation on Friday that Mr. Trump had discussed the payments with Mr. Cohen on the tape but said the payment was ultimately never made. He said the recording was less than two minutes and demonstrated that the president had done nothing wrong.\n\n> “In the big scheme of things, it’s powerful exculpatory evidence,” Mr. Giuliani.\n\nDoing their best Peter Carr:\n\n> “We have nothing to say on this matter,” Mr. Cohen’s lawyer, Lanny J. Davis, said when asked about the tape."
'Lordy!\n\nE:Seems like he knows better than anybody that Trump will throw pretty much anybody under the bus to protect himself. Why else would Cohen need to secretly record Trump 2 months before the election?'
'>But ultimately a deal was never made.\n\nI find that very goddamn interesting because On November 4, 2016, four days before the election, the Wall Street Journal reported that American Media, Inc., the publisher of the National Enquirer, had paid a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for exclusive rights to McDougal’s story, which it never ran. Purchasing a story in order to bury it is a practice that many in the tabloid industry call “catch and kill.” This is a favorite tactic of the C.E.O. and chairman of A.M.I., David Pecker, who describes the President as “a personal friend.” As part of the agreement, A.M.I. consented to publish a regular aging-and-fitness column by McDougal. After Trump won the Presidency, however, A.M.I.’s promises largely went unfulfilled, according to McDougal. Last month, the Journal reported that Trump’s personal lawyer had negotiated a separate agreement just before the election with an adult-film actress named Stephanie Clifford, whose screen name is Stormy Daniels, which barred her from discussing her own affair with Trump. Since then, A.M.I. has repeatedly approached McDougal about extending her contract.'
'Here is an important question: why do prosecutors have this recording?\n\nIf the tape is simply them discussing a potential payment without anything illegal, that seems like exactly the type of thing that would be covered by attorney client privilege. The evidence was reviewed by a judge for potentially privileged information, but it sounds like it was released.\n\nIf this recording is innocent and harmless, why wouldn’t it be privileged? '
'Man if Obama had done half of the shit, not even half, just quarter of the shit, that trump is doing rn, the Republican part would be all over this. Don’t worry guys, we will remember you in the future. The Republican Party will be labeled as traitors 30 years from now. Fuck you GOP!!'

Either way, the case law will be decided and we, as a country, can push our members of Congress (and the next president, who will hopefully *not* be a Republican) to fix this problem. Our laws need to be tested by tyrants from time to time so that we can strengthen our protections against those tyrants. This may be one such case.\n2.\t*Trump will have legally admitted guilt—in writing—for all to see.* What’s interesting here, however, is that he is not merely being investigated for collusion (in fact, so-called “collusion” probably isn’t even illegal by itself, but, for example, accepting help from a foreign nation *is* a campaign finance law violation at the very least). He’s being investigated for a number of federal and state crimes, including obstruction of justice, money laundering, racketeering, campaign finance violations, etc. This is where it gets interesting. If he pardons himself for a federal crime that also happens to be a *state* crime, he will have admitted guilt to a crime he cannot pardon (the president cannot pardon state crimes). Then we all get to watch as one or more states’ attorneys general come out of the woodwork and issue indictments for him and his family members (this is already likely to happen after Mueller is through with his investigation). Their primary evidence will be the president’s own admission of guilt in the form of a *written* self-pardon. Fun, right?\n\nSo, yes, Mr. President—pardon yourself. I’m not making a joke here. If I see a news alert on my phone tomorrow saying that the president just signed his own pardon, I’m going to cheer uncontrollably.\n\nEven if Giuliani is right about a sitting president being immune from arrest and prosecution while in office (and he’s *not* right—we have precedent for this, and our Founders did not intend to create a public office immune from the law because, you know, they were trying to separate themselves from *exactly* that), the president will not be the president forever. At some point, even if he wins two terms, he will have to leave office. At that point, he will likely find a state’s attorney general or two waiting to prosecute him.\n\nThis really is a no-win situation for the president. He’s damned if he pardons himself (even if he *can*), and he’s damned if he doesn’t. If he were a smart man, he’d have cooperated with the Mueller investigation. If he were a smart man, he’d have never fired Comey in he first place and would have instead allowed him to continue his own investigation. Then he could have simply muddied the waters like he does with everything else, created confusion and doubt, gotten his Republican buddies to do the same, and *maybe* he’d have gotten away with his crimes. But now… not so much.\n\nLet’s be honest, though. The president is the ultimate Icarus. He was greedy and flew too close to the sun. If he’d have never run for office, he could have retired quietly (as quiet as a loudmouth like him can be) and he and the Trump organization would never have been investigated for anything. He made the ultimate mistake—a mistake that probably has the old time mobsters shaking their heads—he drew attention to himself and his criminal activity.'

'FYI the department of justice gave Mueller authority to refer out of scope criminal evidence to other divisions of the department of justice, which is what happened here.\n\nHe passed it off to a Trump appointee US Attorney ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_for_the_Southern_District_of_New_York )  who then thought the evidence was enough to warrant a raid in 3 different places at once.\n\n'
"As  friend of mine just pointed out: \n\n* If Cohen claims attorney-client or work-product privilege on the Stormy documents, it directly implicates Trump in campaign finance violation for the facts already in evidence. \n\n* If Cohen claims that Trump is *not* involved in the payment, then those privileges can't apply, and they are open to scrutiny. \n\nBada-bing, bada-boom."
'> The seized records include communications between Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen, which would likely require a special team of agents to review because conversations between lawyers and clients are protected from scrutiny in most instances.\n\nThis sounds like a pretty big fuckin deal.  AFAIK, attorney-client privilege can only be lost when there is evidence that the attorney worked with the client to commit a crime.\n\nGet fucked, Cohen'
'1. According to Cohen\'s own lawyer, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office for the Southern District of New York (widely regarded within itself as being the most important and prestigious U.S. Attorney\'s Office in the country) secured the search warrants for the FBI, based on a referral from Robert Mueller\'s office. Assuming this report is correct, that means that a very mainstream U.S. Attorney\'s Office—not just Special Counsel Robert Mueller\'s office—thought that there was enough for a search warrant here.\n\n2. Moreover, it\'s not just that the office thought that there was enough for a search warrant. They thought there was enough for a search warrant of an attorney\'s office for that attorney\'s client communications. That\'s a very fraught and extraordinary move that requires multiple levels of authorization within the Department of Justice. The U.S. Attorney\'s Manual (USAM)—at Section 9-13.320—contains the relevant policies and procedures. The highlights:\n\n**The feds are only supposed to raid a law firm if less intrusive measures won\'t work.\xa0As the USAM puts it:**\n\n>In order to avoid impinging on valid attorney-client relationships, prosecutors are expected to take the least intrusive approach consistent with vigorous and effective law enforcement when evidence is sought from an attorney actively engaged in the practice of law. Consideration should be given to obtaining information from other sources or through the use of a subpoena, unless such efforts could compromise the criminal investigation or prosecution, or could result in the obstruction or destruction of evidence, or would otherwise be ineffective.\n\n**Such a search requires high-level approval.** The USAM requires such a search warrant to be approved by the U.S. attorney—the head of the office, a presidential appointee—and requires "consultation" with the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. This is not a couple of rogue AUSAs sneaking in a warrant.\n\n**Such a search requires an elaborate review process.**The basic rule is that the government may not deliberately seize, or review, attorney-client communications. The USAM—and relevant caselaw—therefore require the feds to set up a review process. That process might involve a judge reviewing the materials to separate out what is privileged (or what might fall within an exception to the privilege), or else set up a "dirty team" that does the review but is insulated from the "clean team" running the investigation. Another option is a "special master," an experienced and qualified third-party attorney to do the review. Sometimes the reviewing team will only be identifying and protecting privileged material. Sometimes the reviewing team will be preparing to seek, or to implement, a court ruling that the documents are not privileged. (Robert Mueller is aggressive on this sort of thing; he already\xa0sought and obtained a court ruling\xa0that some of Paul Manafort\'s communications with his lawyers were not privileged because they were undertaken for the purpose of fraud—the so-called "crime-fraud exception" to the attorney-client privilege.)\n\n3. A magistrate judge signed off on this. Federal magistrate judges (appointed by local district judges, not by the president) review search warrant applications. A magistrate judge therefore reviewed this application and found probable cause—that is, probable cause to believe that the subject premises (Cohen\'s office) contains specified evidence of a specified federal crime. Now, magistrate judges sometimes are a little too rubber-stampy for my taste (notably, recall the time that a magistrate judge signed off on a truly ludicrous gag order forbidding\xa0Reason\xa0from revealing that it had been served with a subpoena for information identifying commenters). But here, where the magistrate judge knew that this would become one of the most scrutinized search warrant applications ever, and because the nature of the warrant of an attorney\'s office is unusual, you can expect that the magistrate judge felt pretty confident that there was enough there.\n\n4. The search warrant application (the lengthy narrative from the FBI agent setting for the evidence) is almost certainly still under seal, and even Michael Cohen doesn\'t get to see it (yet). But the FBI would have left the warrant itself—and that shows (1) the federal criminal statutes they were investigating, and (2) the list of items they wanted to seize. Much can be learned for those. Assuming Michael Cohen doesn\'t release it, watch for it to be leaked.\n\n**Again: This is a big deal.**\n\n**It\'s early times. Watch for the search warrant itself—that will show us what crimes they are investigating and what documents they think are probative of that crime. Watch also for what Michael Cohen\'s lawyers do in the struggle to compel arbitration with Stormy Daniels in a federal court in Los Angeles—the search warrant dramatically complicates whether Cohen can, or should, submit to any questions in that case. Be skeptical of the surge of misinformation and inaccurate legal takes that are certain to drop. But watch. This is historic.**\n\n[S](https://www.popehat.com/2018/04/09/the-search-of-trump-lawyer-michael-cohens-office-what-we-can-infer-immediately/)'

"Definitely interesting that it was a result of a referral by Mueller.

'Here\'s an excellent synopsis of why this is a HUGE deal. A comment made by someone on the NYT site:\n\n> As a lawyer of 35 years, this is one of the most significant developments in the Mueller investigation.\n\n> It is extraordinarily hard to convince a judge, who is a former lawyer himself or herself, to pierce the attorney/client privilege and work product doctrine to issue a subpoena and seize material subject to those sacred protections.\n\n> The judge must be convinced that Cohen\'s records will demonstrate substantial criminal activity.\n\n> This may be "Black Monday" for Donald Trump.\n\nI think Trump is going to fire Mueller now.'

'I found something interesting in the [Hill\'s article](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/371333-state-dept-tells-congress-no-additional-russia-sanctions-necessary-at), which enthusiastic Trump cultists are quoting in other threads:\n\n> The 2017 legislation allows President Trump to postpone imposing sanctions on people or entities if he determines they are largely scaling back their transactions with Russia\'s defense or intelligence sectors, as long as he notifies the appropriate congressional committees at least every 180 days that they are seeing such progress.\n\nI\'ve been trying to corroborate the Hill\'s mention of this provision in the law with other news sources, but no one else has mentioned it. So I decided to just find the provision in the body of the bill itself (H.R. 3364). ~~I found this in [Section 112, subsection (a), paragraph 1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3364/text):~~\n\nEDIT 2: u/ethertrace pointed out that my original citation was related to sanctions on Iran but that similar language (not related to Iran) appears later in the bill, specifically [Section 236](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3364/text), which states:\n\n> (b) <<NOTE: Determination.>> Waiver of Sanctions That Are Imposed.--\nSubject to section 216, if the President imposes sanctions with respect \nto a person under this part or the amendments made by this part, the \nPresident may waive the application of those sanctions if the President \ndetermines that such a waiver is in the national security interest of \nthe United States.\n\nThis is not what the Hill wrote in their article. Waiving sanctions because people/entities are "scaling back" transactions and waiving them if you determine that it\'s vital to national security to waive the sanctions are two completely different things. ~~Furthermore, the bill imposes strict reporting requirements:~~\n\n~~The Trump administration has yet to release any such reports. At this point, the administration\'s only argument for waiving sanctions is, "Meh, we don\'t need to impose sanctions. Why? Just \'cause."~~\n\n~~Lastly, and most importantly, the law says the president may waive sanctions on a "case-by-case basis." Trump has decided not to impose sanctions on ANYONE. So all the cases don\'t deserve sanctions in the eyes of the Trump administration? What a load of bullshit. The text of the law was clearly drafted to account for occasional exceptions to these sanctions, not to dismiss all of them outright. Trump is using a technicality to abuse this provision of the law to his (and the Russian government\'s) advantage.~~\n\nEDIT 3: Section 236 further provides the following conditions that need to be satisfied to justify a waiver of sanctions:\n\n> (c) <<NOTE: Notice.>> Termination.--Subject to section 216, the \nPresident may terminate the application of sanctions under section 224, \n231, 232, 233, or 234 with respect to a person if the President submits \nto the appropriate congressional committees--\n            (1) a notice of and justification for the termination; and\n            (2) a notice that--\n                    (A) the person is not engaging in the activity that \n                was the basis for the sanctions or has taken significant \n                verifiable steps toward stopping the activity; and\n                    (B) the President has received reliable assurances \n                that the person will not knowingly engage in activity \n                subject to sanctions under this part in the future.\n\nThis is some vague law here. This does not change the fact that the president is given considerable executive authority in an important matter affecting national security. This provision basically says the president can terminate sanctions if the target of the sanctions promises never to have shady dealings with the Russians ever again. What the hell kind of Mickey Mouse nonsense is this? Trump can basically say, "It\'s okay. They promised to never do it again. It was a pinky promise." This is an extremely low bar for the president to justify terminating sanctions.\n\nIf Congress has any sort of spine, it should pass an addendum that nullifies this waiver provision. This provision is flawed because it gives the president too much wiggle room to weasel out of imposing sanctions on an adversarial foreign power.\n\nEDIT: To add one more point, I believe an argument can be made that the president is using this provision of the law to circumvent his constitutional duty of executing laws. This could potentially render this provision of the law unconstitutional. IANAL, and this is just my layman\'s interpretation of the law.\n\nEDIT 4: I apologize for the formatting as I\'m doing the edits on mobile this morning.\n\nEDIT 5: A number of Redditors responding to this comment brought up an interesting point. I originally posted Section 112 from the CAATSA bill not realizing that section relates to sanctions on Iran. I edited out this citation since it became irrelevant to my original point. However, I\'d like to reintroduce this citation to serve as a basis for comparison between Iran sanctions and Russian sanctions:\n\n> (b) Contents of Waiver Reports.--Each report submitted under subsection (a) in connection with a waiver of sanctions under section 104, 105, 106, 107, or 108 with respect to a person, or the renewal of such a waiver, shall include-- (1) a specific and detailed rationale for the determination that the waiver is vital to the national security interests of the United States; (2) a description of the activity that resulted in the person being subject to sanctions; (3) an explanation of any efforts made by the United States, as applicable, to secure the cooperation of the government with primary jurisdiction over the person or the location where the activity described in paragraph (2) occurred in terminating or, as appropriate, penalizing the activity; and (4) <<NOTE: Assessment.>> an assessment of the significance of the activity described in paragraph (2) in contributing to the ability of Iran to threaten the interests of the United States or allies of the United States, develop systems capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction, support acts of international terrorism, or violate the human rights of any person in Iran.\n\nThe reporting requirements for Iran sanctions appear to be *far* stricter than the requirements for Russian sanctions. Russian reporting requirements to waive sanctions essentially amount to a pinky swear while sanctions on Iran require excruciatingly detailed reporting. This makes it appear as though Iran is being regarded as a bigger threat than Russia, a country that openly attacked our electoral process.\n\nEDIT 6: As a matter of fact, the text of the bill seems to indicate that waiver of sanctions on the Russian Federation has *no* reporting requirements. Section 236(c) only describes reporting requirements for lifting (terminating) sanctions that *have already been imposed under this bill.* If the president just waives them to begin with, his only condition to satisfy is determining that the waiver is vital to national security. Iran\'s waivers require detailed reporting and documentation. This bill\'s text indicates further evidence that the president is taking a soft stance on the country that undermined and continues to undermine our democratic electoral processes.'

It then reprised many of the same arguments it made in trying to convince Trump Jr. to turn over his father’s tax returns, including the argument that Trump’s enemies in the press were using the emails to spin an unfavorable narrative of the meeting. “Us publishing not only deprives them of this ability but is beautifully confounding.”\n\n>The message was sent at 9:29 am on July 11.

'>It is the third reason, though, Wikileaks wrote, that “is the real kicker.” “If we publish them it will dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality,” Wikileaks explained. “That means that the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing on Clinton will have much higher impact, because it won’t be perceived as coming from a ‘pro-Trump’ ‘pro-Russia’ source.” It then provided an email address and link where the Trump campaign could send the tax returns, and adds, “The same for any other negative stuff (documents, recordings) that you think has a decent chance of coming out. Let us put it out.”\n\nHAHAHAHAHA.. WikiLeaks is not impartial at all. Trumpsters actually tried to say he just cared about getting the truth out. '

'"Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don’t want to act, or even talk, alone; you don’t want to ‘go out of your way to make trouble.’ Why not?—Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.\n\nUncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, ‘everyone’ is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You know, in France or Italy there would be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences; in Germany, outside the great cities, perhaps, there is not even this. In the university community, in your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, ‘It’s not so bad’ or ‘You’re seeing things’ or ‘You’re an alarmist.’\n\nAnd you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can’t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don’t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.\n\nBut your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Informal groups become smaller; attendance drops off in little organizations, and the organizations themselves wither. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to—to what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then you are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.\n\nBut the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That’s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the ‘German Firm’ stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.\n\nAnd one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way."\n\n-They Thought They Were Free\n\nThe Germans, 1933-45\n\nMilton Mayer'

'Children, mothers, and families have rights. \n\nhttps://www.loc.gov/law/help/child-rights/international-law.php\n\n>Declaration of the Rights of the Child 1959[2]\nThe U.N. Declaration of the Rights of the Child (DRC) builds upon rights that had been set forth in a League of Nations Declaration of 1924.  The Preamble notes that **children need “special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth**,” reiterates the 1924 Declaration’s pledge that “**mankind owes to the child the best it has to give**,” and specifically calls upon voluntary organizations and local authorities to strive for the observance of children’s rights.[3] One of the key principles in the DRC is that a child is to enjoy “special protection” as well as “opportunities and facilities, by law and by other means,” for healthy and normal physical, mental, moral, spiritual, and social development “**in conditions of freedom and dignit**y.”  The “paramount consideration” in enacting laws for this purpose is “**the best interests of the child**,”[4] a standard echoed throughout legal instruments on children’s rights.  Among other DRC principles, a child is entitled to a name and nationality; to adequate nutrition, housing, recreation, and medical services; to an education; and, for the handicapped, to “special treatment, education and care.”[5] Other principles are on protection against neglect, cruelty and exploitation, trafficking, underage labor, and discrimination.\n\n>U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989\nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) is the most comprehensive document on the rights of children.[7]  Based purely on the number of substantive rights it sets forth, as distinct from implementation measures, it is the longest U.N. human rights treaty in force and unusual in that it not only addresses the granting and implementation of rights in peacetime, but also the treatment of children in situations of armed conflict.  The CRC is also significant because it enshrines, “for the first time in binding international law, the principles upon which adoption is based, viewed from the child’s perspective.”[8]  **The CRC is primarily concerned with four aspects of children’s rights (“the four ‘P’s”): participation by children in decisions affecting them; protection of children against discrimination and all forms of neglect and exploitation; prevention of harm to them; and provision of assistance to children for their basic needs**.[9]  For the purposes of the CRC, a child is defined as “every human being below the age of eighteen years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier” (article 1). \n\n>Key accomplishments of the CRC have been described as five-fold.  It creates new rights for children under international law that previously had not existed, such as the child’s right to preserve his or her identity (articles 7 and 8), the **rights of vulnerable children like refugees to special protection (articles 20 and 22), and indigenous children’s right to practice their culture (articles 8 and 30)**.  In some instances, this innovation takes the form of child-specific versions of existing rights, such as those in regard to freedom of expression (article 13) and the right to a fair trial (article 40).  In addition, the CRC enshrines in a global treaty rights that hitherto had only been found in case law under regional human rights treaties (e.g., children’s right to be heard in proceedings that affect them) (article 12).  The CRC also replaced non-binding recommendations with binding standards (e.g., safeguards in adoption procedures and with regard to the rights of disabled children) (articles 21 and 23).  **New obligations are imposed on States Parties in regard to the protection of children, in such areas as banning traditional practices prejudicial to children’s health and offering rehabilitative measures for victims of neglect, abuse, and exploitation** (articles 28(3) and 39).  Finally, the CRC sets forth an express ground obligating States Parties not to discriminate against children’s enjoyment of CRC rights.[10]  The right to participate in proceedings, it is argued, “together with the principles of non-discrimination in Article 2 and provision for the child’s best interests in Article 3, form the guiding principles of the Convention, which reflect the vision of respect and autonomy which the drafters wished to create for all children.”[11] \n\n>Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948[23]\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights contains two articles that specifically refer to children.  Article 25(2) states: “**[m]otherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance**.  All children whether born in or out of wedlock shall enjoy the same social protection.”[24]  Article 26 calls for the right to education for all, and deals both with access to and the aims of education.  Thus, education is to be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages; elementary education is to be compulsory; and education should be “**directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms**.”  Nevertheless, “[p]arents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.”\n\n>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1966[25] - The Preamble to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), insofar as it recognizes the indivisibility of human rights, is applicable to children’s rights as well.  Thus, it notes that “**recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world**” and that “**these rights derive from the inherent dignity of the human person**.”[26] Specific references to children are found in articles 10 and 12.  Under article 10, “**[t]he widest possible protection and assistance should be accorded to the family, … particularly for its establishment and while it is responsible for the care and education of dependent children**” (item 1, in part).  It further stipulates that “**special measures of protection and assistance” should be taken on behalf of the young without any discrimination; that they should be protected from economic and social exploitation**; that employing them in morally or medically harmful or dangerous work or in work likely to hamper their normal development should be punishable by law; and that age limits should be set below which the paid employment of child labor is prohibited and punishable by law (item 3).  Article 12 addresses the right of all to “enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health,” to be fully realized by, among other measures, States Parties’ providing “for the reduction of the stillbirth-rate and of infant mortality and for the healthy development of the child” (item 2(a)).  The ICESCR also provides for the right of everyone to education (article 13(1)) and stipulates “primary education shall be compulsory and available free to all” (article 13(2a)).\n\n>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966 [27]\nThe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) contains general provisions from which children are entitled to benefit as well as certain specific provisions on **safeguards for children in the administration of justice and as members of a family unit**.  Thus, article 2 obliges States Parties “to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction” the rights recognized in the ICCPR, “without distinction of any kind;” **to adopt laws to give effect to those rights; and to provide effective remedies where there are violations**.  Article 14(1) incorporates a more specific reference to rights of the young: “any judgement rendered in a criminal case or in a suit at law shall be made public except where the interest of juvenile persons otherwise requires or the proceedings concern matrimonial disputes or the guardianship of children.”  Furthermore, criminal proceedings “should take account of [juveniles’] age and the desirability of promoting their rehabilitation” (article 14(4)) and the penal system should segregate juvenile offenders from adults and accord them treatment “appropriate to their age and legal status” (article 10(3)).[28] Like the ICESCR, the ICCPR **recognizes the family as entitled to societal and state protection (article 23(1)), and so States Parties are to respect the liberty of parents to ensure their children’s religious and moral education in conformity with their own convictions** (article 18(4)).  If a marriage is dissolved, provision must be made for the protection of any children (article 23(4)).  Article 24 of the ICCPR is specifically devoted to children.  It stipulates that “**every child shall have, without any discrimination as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, national or social origin, property or birth, the right to such measures of protection as are required by his status as a minor, on the part of his family, society and the State**.”  It further prescribes that every child must be registered immediately after birth and have a name and that every child has the right to acquire a nationality.'

Go after him through more substantial criticisms.\n\nBefore /r/politics gets out its pitchforks, there are some inconsistencies I have found with the story provided, and the 4 different songs that consist of reveille and retreat (Revielle, To the Colors, Retreat, and The National Anthem). Most people in the military won\'t even know of these distinctions unless you get really deep in the protocol, but I have the fortune of having these 4 songs burned into my living memory thanks to physically performing reveille and retreat for 4 years.\n\nWatching the [video](http://content.jwplatform.com/previews/PZ4iATqh-65XfsPGj) from the linked story, it seems like the interview occured in a hangar, which it technically "indoors," meaning it is not subject to normal customs and courtesies that rendered to the flag when it is raised and lowered. So while he is a dumbass for not knowing what the song was being played for, he did nothing wrong by remaining seated and talking through it.\n\nThe song you hear in question is "Retreat" but it is not the same song that is played while the flag is lowered. It is in fact the preamble to the flag lowering ceremony. The only song played when the flag is lowered is the National Anthem. When "Retreat" sounds, all military members who are outside are required to stand silently at attention and face either the flag pole, or if none is in sight, face the direction the music is coming from. Once the song is completed (about 30 seconds) then The National Anthem will play, and the flag will slowly be lowered over the duration of the song. While the song is playing, all military members outside are required to salute, and remain saluted until the music is complete or if the flag is in sight, when the flag completely leaves the flag pole. \n\nThe reverse situation is true during the morning. First reveille sounds as a pre-amble, then "To the Colors" is played while the flag is raised as quickly as humanly possible, getting to the top of the pole before the song is over (which should not be very hard, unless the pulley mechanism freezes up).\n\nFurther Reading:\n\n\n> According to AFPAM 34-1202, 14.10.1, Reveille and Retreat, the U.S. flag is flown daily from reveille until retreat. Reveille is the raising of the flag for the day\'s activities and is a ceremony to honor the flag when it is raised in the morning and plays at 7 a.m. Retreat is the retirement of the flag from the day\'s activities and plays at 4:30 p.m.\n\n> During the playing of reveille and retreat, uniformed military personnel should stand at attention and face the American flag, or the direction of the music if a flag is not visible. If reveille or retreat is followed by the national anthem or "To the Color," military personnel should salute (during the entirety of the song). source: http://www.malmstrom.af.mil/News/Features/Display/Article/825599/customs-and-courtesies-what-to-do-during-reveille-retreat-taps/'

You can't do that in any other capacity. **But as president, I could run the Trump organization, great, great company, and I could run the company -- the country.** I'd do a very good job, but I don't want to do that.\n\n- [Donald J. Trump, President-Elect, January 11th, 2017](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38536671)"
'Here is the full article. Emphasis is mine.\n\n>**Even after taking office, President Donald Trump sold more than $35 million worth of real estate last year to secretive buyers.**\n\n\n>Trump sold 41 luxury condo units in Las Vegas last year to people who used limited liability companies (LLCs), which **allow them to hide their identities, a USA Today review found. The president can withdraw profits from these sales at any time using a trust that names him as the sole beneficiary, but is managed by sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.**\n\n\n>**Before Trump signed the tax bill into law in December 2017, a last-minute tax break was added for real estate investors who use LLCs, partnerships and S-corporations to make deals.**\n\n\n>The number of buyers using LLCs to purchase property from Trump climbed even before the tax break was announced last year. **A mere 4 percent of buyers used the secretive shell companies in the two years before Trump became the Republican nominee. A year later, the number dramatically increased to nearly 70 percent, according to USA Today.** \n\n\n>One Chicago neurosurgeon, Ramis Ghaly, told the paper that he used an LLC to purchase a Trump condo in Las Vegas at the advice of his financial consultant. Ghaly said that the positives of the property outweighed his concerns about being associated with president\'s politics. \n\n\n>But with a majority of buyers are choosing to remain anonymous, liberal watchdog groups including Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) have raised questions about the transparency of Trump\'s foreign deals. The sale of Trump\'s Palm Beach mansion to a Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev in 2008 resurfaced last year after speculation that the Trump administration had colluded with Russia during his 2016 presidential campaign. Moreover, a Reuters report found that at least **63 people with "Russian passports or addresses" has purchased nearly $98.4 million worth of Trump\'s property in South Florida.** Trump has also sold his personal Park Avenue penthouse to Chinese investor Angela Chen. \n\n\n>“If someone wants to do business with the Trump entities in the form of an LLC, we look behind the LLC to see who the owner of it is and where the funding is coming from,” Bobby Burchfield, the ethics advisor at the Trump Organization told the publication. “If we can’t determine that, we won’t sign off on it.”\n\n\n>Before his inauguration, Trump announced that he would turn over his companies to his sons, but would not divest from his properties and assets.\n\n\n>“While I am not mandated to do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses,” Trump said in a series of tweets in November 2016. “Hence, legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations. The Presidency is a far more important task!”\n\n\n>**The tax break for LLCs, S-corps, LPs and other businesses permit owners to avoid paying business tax rates by allowing income to pass through to partners who will then pay an individual tax rate on the money. **\n\n\n>New York real estate mogul Steve Witkoff told Newsweek in December the benefits of the tax bill reaped by real estate investors will trickle down into the economy.\n\n\n>“I think you\'ve got to create all those conditions that get the private sector to want to invest,” Witkoff said. “The president\'s game plan is more growth. Let\'s add several trillion more dollars of GDP, expand the tax net, lower the amount that you pay, but expand it. More tax revenue means we\'re going to pay down the deficit.”'

'I am a lawyer. A motion in limine is a basic legal proceeding that occurs in every case that gets close to trial. Daubert is a little more advanced, but just explains rules of evidence 701, 702, and maybe 703 without re-reading that decision. Daubert relates to experts and when their opinions can be presented to the jury. The two abstention doctrines I don\'t know off hand, but I presume it deals with jurisdiction of federal courts vs. state courts. \n\nI am a lawyer, I did not Google any part of my above answer, but wanted to be honest about what a lawyer should know without doing research. At a minimum he should have some knowledge of a motion in limine and the Daubert questions.  He should have known the answers to the abstention questions through Senate hearing preparation. \n\nInasmuch an analogy would help. If this were baseball, a motion in limine would be similar to "what is a grand slam?"  Daubert would be similar to the infield fly rule. Abstention question would be similar to whether there is a designated hitter in the world series when the game is played in an American league park....and this guy is being nominated to be the umpire your next major league baseball game.'

'Try not to puke... Here is the full resignation letter: \n> Mr. President, it has been an honor to serve you in the Cabinet as Administrator of the EPA. Truly, your confidence in me has blessed me personally and enabled me to advance your agenda beyond what anyone anticipated at the beginning of your Administration. Your courage, steadfastness and resolute commitment to get results for the American people, both with regard to improved environmental outcomes as well as historical regulatory reform, is in fact occurring at an unprecedented pace and I thank you for the opportunity to serve you and the American people in helping achieve those ends.\n\n> That is why is hard for me to advise you I am stepping down as Administrator of the EPA effective as of July 6. It is extremely difficult for me to cease serving you in this role first because I count it a blessing to be serving you in any capacity, but also, because of the transformative work that is occurring. However, the unrelenting attacks on me personally, my family, are unprecedented and have taken a sizable toll on all of us.\n\n> My desire in service to you has always been to bless you as you make important decisions for the American people. I believe you are serving as President today because of God’s providence. I believe that same providence brought me into your service. I pray as I have served you that I have blessed you and enabled you to effectively lead the American people. Thank you again Mr. President for the honor of serving you and I wish you Godspeed in all that you put your hand to. Your Faithful Friend, Scott Pruitt\n\n'
">Scott Pruitt was the worst EPA administrator in the history of the agency. Not only has he acted, time and time again, in an unethical manner, but he has led the agency in exactly the wrong direction. Instead of protecting our environment and combating climate change, he has worked to protect the interests of the fossil fuel industry and polluters all over the country. His resignation is a positive step forward for our country. I will do everything possible to see that the next EPA administrator actually believes in environmental protection.  \n\n-[Senator Sander's statement on Pruitt's resignation](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-statement-on-scott-pruitt)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>I think Scott Pruitt has done incalculable harm to environmental protection in this country and he is also ethically challenged. But the major concern that I have is than in a time when climate change is the great environmental crisis facing this planet, (Just this week we've seen [reports]( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2018/07/03/hot-planet-all-time-heat-records-have-been-set-all-over-the-world-in-last-week/?utm_term=.751e9dbfedc3) of communities  all over American and the world seeing the highest temperatures that they ever have seen) we have an EPA director who doesn't even believe in climate change, let alone propose ideas to address the crisis.   \n\n>Pruitt has been nothing more than an agent for the fossil fuel industry, much more concerned about their profits than the needs of the American people. So I'm delighted that he's gone.  \n\n>What we've got to do now is to see if we can get a handful of Republican Senators to understand that climate change is real. That environmental protection is enormously important for this country, and get them onboard to demand that Trump appoint an EPA administrator that represents the American people and not just the fossil fuel industry.  \n\n---  \n\n>I think Andrew Wheeler should be vigorously opposed. The American people are very clear. They understand that climate change is real. They want a planet that will be habitable for our children and our grandchildren. and you don't need representatives of the Koch brothers or the fossil fuel industry to be making policy.  \n\n>We need people making policy who understand that environmental protection is *ENORMOUSLY* important to the future of this country. \n\n---  \n\n>Not every Republican agrees with Trump or Pruitt that climate change is a hoax. There are many Republicans who understand that it is real, that it is an enormously serious issue. And we need 3-4 of them to join with us in saying that we need an EPA administrator that actually believes in environmental protection rather than just the profits of the oil industry, the gas industry, or the coal industry.  \n\n>That's what we need to do. And we've got to put pressure on our Republican colleagues to get them onboard.  \n\n---  \n\n>[Q: What haven't Democrats been able to make environmental regulation a campaign issue?] \n\n>As opposed to what else? As opposed to Trump's  \n\n>* trying to throw 32 million people off of health insurance? \n>* Racism? \n>* policies of separating tiny children from their mothers?  \n>* trying to destroy long-term alliances that we have with allies all over the world?  \n\n>Problem is there are so many things that Trump is doing that environmental issues become one of many. But I do agree, this is a major, major issue. Look at the future of this planet. If we don't get our act together and transform our energy system, and move to energy efficiency & sustainable energy, I worry very much about the kind of planet we're leaving to future generations.   \n\n>This is an issue of enormous consequence, except when you deal with Trump we're dealing with many, many issues of enormous consequence.  \n\n>Thank you, take care.  \n\n-Bernie Sanders, [July 5^th '18](https://youtu.be/1Vwpl8ILlpM?t=2412)\n"

"I really do hope that despite his resignation, the baker's dozen or so investigations into his actions during his tenure continue.  The chances that he didn't break the law at least several times seem small, and that should have consequences.  And frankly, his deputy who is replacing him was likely balls deep in about half of it.

Including a long list of all the times he was forced to appear before court and testified "He couldnt recall or just spoke gibberish" \n\nI highly recommend  checking all of them out. \n\nHere is a clear and sobering interview:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19KI_2X2Sfs\n\n '

'Now you guys are getting the idea. These should have been set up 6-8 months ago, better late than never.

'This sounds like a fun time.  Might as well entertain ourselves while pointing out that the whole country is under Russian control.'
'while obviously not everybody can continuously protest outside the white house, this should still be a growing thing and people who can\'t stay there should nevertheless join frequently, bring food and water and encouragement. bring your kids and neighbours if you live anywhere near there and make it a habit at least twice a week to go there for a couple of hours.\n\nmake an elaborate sign, let your kids help, bring that sign every time. make it a competition or whatever. make it interesting enough to keep going.\n\nthis might sound crazy but this is how you keep people going. just being angry will only get you so far. above all that you need support of not so angry people and reasonable people who realize that you can protest consistently without having to give up your livelyhood.\n\nthe more people join in just there, just in front of the white house, just making clear you want this administration gone and fast, the more clear the message is. if you keep it simple people won\'t get confused easily, will be better prepared to answer questions and will have more in common.\n\nin the end a consistently growing crowd that just doesn\'t go away has more weight than a small angry crowd that can\'t go for long.\n\nedit: addition\n\ni can\'t help but think that many of the american people in this subreddit, who are desperate for change, believe you have to sacrifice your life and become a hero to make a difference. this is not the case. that\'s also a very american thing. the weird "anti-socialism" narrative that seems to go against anything that involves solidarity or combined effort, makes organizing a protest look more dangerous than it probably is, even in your country.'

'> [I also hear from multiple sources that Secret Service agents are at the end of their rope, sick of being treated like servants by Trump.](https://twitter.com/christinawilkie/status/899616421113733124)\n\n>[Source: "Clinton treated USSS agents like friends. Bush treated them w great respect. Obama, like family. Trump treats them like servants."](https://twitter.com/christinawilkie/status/899628508544151552)\n\n> [Specifically, I\'ve been told Trump doesn\'t respect their hours & shifts, and expects agents to fetch things for him. Both damaging morale.](https://twitter.com/christinawilkie/status/899622220909101061)'
'I\'ve always personally politically identified as a fiscal conservative and social liberal (which, yes, feels oxymoronic at times). This is painful. I like the idea of a smaller government, and I like the idea that people who can help themselves *should* help themselves, and the community assists those who cannot. \n\nBut that\'s not really what\'s happening here. It\'s more like even though Trump could help by providing free golf carts (for the paltry sum of $13,500 for the past vacation) for those who are protecting him and his family - thus *helping himself* - he chooses to have his business charge the money. He can\'t say "I have nothing to do with that!" because he hasn\'t fully divested himself - and his protectoree children run it and make the same choice. \n\nYet when it comes to protecting federal lands from logging or fracking, it doesn\'t directly benefit the Trumps for that land to remain pristine, so screw it. Let\'s save money there. \n\nTrump is doing exactly what everyone blames Millennials for - being all about "Me, Me, Me". '
"you know what my rich friends say? he’s a genius.\n\nhe definitely is. he’s lining his pockets over the next 4 years with millions and millions just from the payments the government makes to his properties. \n\nsomeone go calculate his presidents salary and then do the same counting in all the years of staff having to book his proprieties. he’s probably the best paid president in history and history to come.\n\nand best of all, it’s all legal, he can himself control a budget increase to increase his own income from the spending, and nobody can do anything about it. he can then also increase the prices in his own properties to suck more and more money from the government. completely legal.\n\nalso who will complain? he’s the business man that the people wanted to clean up he government. it’s tax payer money so it’s not directly affecting anyone, your tax payments will not go up... the white house will have hundreds of good explanations to cover his ass.\n\nhe indeed is a fucking genius. holy shit...\n\n\nedit: why the down votes? this is really not pro trump... that's just the view of the people who control the country and why they still like him. they think what he does is smart. as he probably thinks its smart. I personally think it's straight up abuse of tax payer money... but again, it appears to be all legal even if morally not okay. which is insane. "
"Well, not paying people who work for him is Trump's favorite thing in the world. I'm sure this was all part of his 12D master checkmate plan."
"I feel like this is a good place for his presidency to end. The people who are protecting him aren't getting paid now, he might as well resign and do everyone a favor."
"Hilarious, we can see why Trump bankrupted like 5+ times in his life and he's doing it Countrywide now. Whoever voted in this village idiot has no intellectual leg to stand on. The irony is best. He's such a good businessman though, right. He wouldn't have anything if he wasn't GIFTED/welfared 250mil from dear mother. \n\nHe has no money in his pocket. He's a millionaire at best. \n\nThis, after finding out Gearbox Software raised the cost of _We Happy Few_ to $60 ($79.99) from $30 _just because_ Compulsion Games sold out. "
'I\'ve tried to defend certain actions of Trump but I was worried about stuff like this from the beginning.  The fact that people talk about him being a "successful businessman" like it was a good thing sickened me.  There are two types of successful business people, those who do whatever it takes to keep their business afloat and those who do whatever it takes to make sure they personally don\'t lose money in any business venture.  One way to accomplish the latter is destroying the image of the business in order to maintain profits until it massively fails all at once rather than slowly leaching money and taking a loss in the hopes that hard work and a good product will eventually sustain a successful business.'
"It's more than obvious that he profits from these trips and won't stop doing it anytime soon. Who else in the world would love more than support his brand than the douche himself. "
'For a smart business man he sure knows how to frivolously blow through others peoples money.'

Defendant PAPADOPOULOS acknowledged\nthat the professor had told him about the Russians possessing "dirt" on then-candidate Hillary\nClinton in the form of "thousands of emails," but stated multiple times that he learned that\ninformation prior to joining the Campaign. In truth and in fact, however, defendant\nPAPADOPOULOS learned he would be an advisor to the Campaign in early March, and met the\nprofessor on or about March 14, 2016; the professor only took interest in defendant\nPAPADOPOULOS because of his status with the Campaign; and the professor told defendant\nPAPADOPOULOS about the "thousands of emails" on or about April 26, 2016, when defendant\nPAPADOPOULOS had been a foreign policy adviser to the Campaign for over a month. \n\nBest Monday ever!\n\n>**II. Timeline of Selected Events**  \n>PAPADOPOULOS\'s Role on the Campaign  \n4. In early March 2016, defendant PAPADOPOULOS learned he would be a foreign\npolicy advisor for the Campaign. Defendant PAPADOPOULOS was living in London, England,\nat the time. Based on a conversation that took place on or about March 6, 2016, with a\nsupervisory campaign official (the "Campaign Supervisor"), defendant PAPADOPOULOS\nunderstood that a principal foreign policy focus of the Campaign was an improved U.S.\nrelationship with Russia.\n\n>**PAPADOPOULOS \'s Introduction to the Professor and the Female Russian National**  \n>5. On or about March 14, 2016, while traveling in Italy, defendant\nPAPADOPOULOS met an individual who was a professor based in London (the "Professor").\nInitially, the Professor seemed uninterested in defendant PAPADOPOULOS. However, after\ndefendant PAPADOPOULOS infonned the Professor about his joining the Campaign, the\nProfessor appeared to take great interest in defendant PAPADOPOULOS. Defendant\nPAPADOPOULOS was interested in the Professor because, among other reasons, the Professor\nclaimed to have substantial connections with Russian government officials, which defendant\nPAPADOPOULOS thought could increase his importance as a policy advisor to the Campaign.  \n>6. On or about March 21, 2016, the Campaign told The Washington Post that\ndefendant PAPADOPOULOS was one of five named foreign policy advisors for the Campaign.  \n>7. On or about March 24, 2016, defendant PAPADOPOULOS met with the\nProfessor in London. **The Professor brought with him a female Russian national (the "Female\nRussian National"), introduced to defendant PAPADOPOULOS as a relative of Russian\nPresident Vladimir Putin with connections to senior Russian government officials.**\n\n"Female Russian National" introduced as a relative of Putin...perhaps the lawyer from Jr.\'s meeting at Trump Tower? Ahahaha these motherfuckers are gonna fry\n\n> **10. After his trip to Washington, D.C., defendant PAPADOPOULOS worked with the\nProfessor and the Female Russian National to arrange a meeting between the Campaign and the\nRussian government, and took steps to advise the Campaign of his progress.** \n\nThere it is folks. A Trump foreign policy adviser was working with a Russian National--who identified herself as a relative of Putin--to arrange a meetings between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government.

'The Statement of the Offence is absolutely amazing.\n\n> Following his March 24, 2016 meeting with the Professor and the Female Russian National, defendant PAPADOPOULOS emailed the Campaign Supervisor and several members of the Campaign\'s foreign policy team and stated that he had just met with his "good friend" the Professor, who had introduced him to the Female Russian National (described by defendant PAPADOPOULOS in the email as "Putin\'s niece") and the Russian Ambassador in London. Defendant PAPADOPOULOS stated that the topic of their discussion was "to arrange a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to discuss U.S.-Russia ties under President Trump."\n\n[...]\n\n> In early April 2016, defendant PAPADOPOULOS sent multiple emails to other members of the Campaign\'s foreign policy team regarding his contacts with "the Russians" and his "outreach to Russia.

Defendant PAPADOPOULOS then asked the Female Russian National, in an email cc\'ing the Professor, about setting up "a potential foreign policy trip to Russia."\n\n[...]\n\n> The Professor responded to defendant PAPADOPOULOS\'s email later that day, on or about April 11, 2016: "This is already been agreed. I am flying to Moscow on the 18th for a Valdai meeting, plus other meetings at the Duma." The Duma is a Russian government legislative assembly.

During this meeting, the Professor told defendant PAPADOPOULOS that he had just returned from a trip to Moscow where he had met with high-level Russian government officials. The Professor told defendant PAPADOPOULOS that on that trip he (the Professor) learned that the Russians had obtained "dirt" on then-candidate Clinton. The Professor told defendant PAPADOPOULOS, as defendant PAPADOPOULOS later described to the FBI, that "They [the Russians] have dirt on her"; "the Russians had emails of Clinton"; "they have thousands of emails."\n\n[...]\n\n> On or about June 1, 2016, defendant PAPADOPOULOS emailed the High-Ranking Campaign Official and asked about Russia. The High-Ranking Campaign Official referred him to the Campaign Supervisor because "[h]e is running point."

'This is what corruption looks like.  This is miles beyond what we saw in the Bush administration where companies like Halliburton were given no-bid contracts in Iraq.  At least there the company fully able to do the actual work and the only thing in question was the bidding process.\n\nHere we have straight up kleptocracy, giving a contract like this to an unknown company with two employees with ties to the head of the agency?  What the actual fuck.\n\nAnd from a practical sense there is no way that this is going to end well.  You can\'t go from 2 employees to 280 in a matter of weeks and hope to restore power to all of PR without major fuckups.  The infrastructure to run the company is not even there, let alone the capability to actually do the work.\n\n> Whitefish happened to be the first firm "available to arrive and they were the ones that first accepted terms and conditions for PREPA," Ricardo Ramos, the executive director of PREPA, the island\'s power authority, told reporters.\n\nWell of course they showed up first, it\'s just 2 guys.  You choose who is going to rebuild your power grid by _the first guys that walk through the door_?  I\'m calling bullshit on that.\n\n> Zinke\'s office said in an email to the Post that Zinke and Whitefish\'s chief executive know each other.\n\nYou mean Zinke knows one of the two guys in the company?  Nothing fishy there at all, nope, nothing at all, nothing to see, move along.\n\n> "Everybody knows everybody" in the town, Zinke\'s office said, adding that Zinke wasn\'t involved in the contract.\n\nI\'m sure, they just _happened_ to choose a tiny 2-person company from the Secretary of the Interior\'s home town that he happens to know personally and that just happened to be in the right place at the right time to accept the contract without even taking any other bids.  Right, OK, nothing to do with it.\n\nThis should be a shitstorm, but I bet this is the only thing we ever hear about it.  Later today Trump will tweet something and we\'ll be talking about the goddamn NFL for 2 weeks again.'
"Zinke's commander in the SEALS wrote the following letter:  \n\nedit: adding sources because people asked\n\nhttps://themontanapost.com/2014/05/30/his-former-commander-exposes-ryan-zinkes-navy-seal-career-and-defective-moral-make-up/\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/us/politics/ryan-zinke-navy-seal.html\n\n  \n*It is most unpleasant to write these words, as I have long considered myself a friend of Ryan Zinke.  In fact, he was in the first Basic UDT/SEAL (BUD/S) class to graduate under my command in 1985.  I remember him well and thought that he would have a stellar career.\n\nHe did have such a career until he showed a defect in his moral make-up, and the Left is already well aware of what he did, although perhaps not in so much detail as I go into.  They will, however, before the general election, so I have decided to anticipate them by providing this statement.\n\nThis information was provided to me by sources personally known to me and to those who were directly involved in the actions involving Ryan.\n\nWhat did he do?  Simple—he used Navy (taxpayer) travel funds to make multiple trips from Norfolk, VA, to his home in MT, ostensibly to scout out training sites for his squadron.  The truth was that he went to work on some family property and, apparently, on one occasion, took two or three other Navy SEALs with him.\n\nThese trips not only involved airfare, but they also involved per diem and personal use of Navy time.  To his credit, Ryan, when confronted with his transgressions, admitted his culpability and paid back the funds he had expended.\n\nRyan’s moral failings, in my opinion, do not end with his being separated from his SEAL team over the travel scandal.  His political career has some questionable acts associated with it, to include his creation (with some heavy-hitting New York and Boston lawyers and PR people) of Special Operations for America (SOFA), a Political Action Committee, back in early 2012.  At that time, I sought out Ryan to work with me in establishing an umbrella organization of Special Operations Forces from all the services.\n\nAfter looking carefully at the situation in which he was involved, I just didn’t feel comfortable getting hooked up with what was clearly going to be a high-donor operation and possibly geared to Ryan’s future political benefit.  That has turned out to be the case, as evinced by the fact that, almost immediately after Ryan declared his candidacy for the US House, he resigned as SOFA’s chairman and was given a grant from the very Political Action Committee he established.  That, to me, is not “conflict of interest;” it is “coincidence of interest.”\n\nThe account of what I have read about SOFA having its headquarters in property owned by the Zinke family that is across the street from the Zinke family home, further validates the “coincidence of interest” hypothesis.\n\nAs a retired Navy SEAL officer, I also take exception to the looseness with which Ryan described his Navy career.  Depending on which bio one reads, he was “a” or “the” commander in a certain high-capability Navy SEAL Team.  He was never a commanding officer and was bypassed for possible consideration for promotion to captain as the result of his travel transgressions.\n\nHe also has stated that former Cong. Allen West has endorsed his candidacy.  I spoke with Colonel West personally and learned that, while he spoke kind words about Ryan, he did not endorse him.  Subsequent to my conversation with him, Colonel West has made clear that that was not the case and will not be the case during the primary.\n\nHaving seen a heavily redacted copy of Ryan’s DD-214, which is a summary of his military career, I noted that, unlike his claim to have received two Bronze Stars for combat, he actually received them for meritorious service.  Neither had the Combat “V” for Valor, which would have been the case had he earned the awards for combat.\n\nThe statement by a retired Navy SEAL Master Chief sums up the essence of Ryan’s character.  The man told me personally that Ryan is PNG (persona non grata) at his old SEAL team, primarily for the misleading statements he has made about his rank and importance at that “special” team.  That is a sad commentary on a man who had all the potential in the world and has, instead of coming clean about himself and his mistakes, tries to re-write his personal history in order to achieve political office.\n\nI am certain that Ryan would have acquitted himself well if he had led his men in actual combat instead of being a theater manager of the combat units assigned to him.\n\nI am sure that Ryan will do his best to rebut these serious allegations.  He can prove me wrong by making his unredacted DD-214 available for public examination.  I would like nothing better than to have been shown that I was wrong, but that won’t happen.\n\nWhy do I, a transplanted Texan living in NC, want to rupture more than one friendship over Ryan Zinke’s candidacy for the US House of Representatives?  Simple—Ryan’s ambitions will not stop here.  He has shown by his dissimulation of facts regarding his career that he is willing to do whatever it takes to reach the next level—in his case, the US Senate.  I cannot abide that prospect, because THEN he is representing ME and every citizen of this land as a member of one of the world’s most prestigious deliberative bodies.\n\nLarry Bailey\n\nCAPT (SEAL), USN (Ret.)\n\nChocowinity, NC*"

Even last week\'s Steven Millers "common sense" approach to a shitty immigration bill based on xenophobia. \n\n> NEW YORK — As he has prepared to be named the Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump has not read any biographies of presidents. He said he would like to someday.\n> \n> He has no time to read, he said: “I never have. I’m always busy doing a lot. Now I’m more busy, I guess, than ever before.”\n> \n> ***Trump’s desk is piled high with magazines, nearly all of them with himself on their covers, and each morning, he reviews a pile of printouts of news articles about himself that his secretary delivers to his desk. But there are no shelves of books in his office, no computer on his desk.***\n> \n> Presidents have different ways of preparing to make decisions. Some read deeply, some prefer to review short memos that condense difficult issues into bite-size summaries, ideally with check-boxes at the bottom of the page. But Trump, poised to become the first \xadmajor-party presidential nominee since Dwight Eisenhower who had not previously held elected office, appears to have an unusually light appetite for reading.\n>\n> He said in a series of interviews that he does not need to read extensively because he reaches the right decisions “with very little knowledge other than the knowledge I [already] had, plus the words ‘common sense,’ because I have a lot of common sense and I have a lot of business ability.”\n> \n> Trump said he is skeptical of experts because “they can’t see the forest for the trees.” He believes that when he makes decisions, people see that he instinctively knows the right thing to do: “A lot of people said, ‘Man, he was more accurate than guys who have studied it all the time.’ ”\n> \n> Trump’s approach to understanding complex issues and reaching decisions is not unique in the annals of the presidency. Historians who have studied presidential styles depict a divide between men such as President Obama or presidents Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon, who were given to reading extensively ahead of important decisions, and presidents Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, who preferred to have issues presented to them in short memos or orally.\n\nAlso, here\'s photos of Trump\'s desk in Trump Tower with magazines with him on the cover that he would hand out. \n\nhttp://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170127132729-01-trump-tower-desk-file-large-169.jpg\n\nhttps://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/26/us/26TRUMPORG2/26TRUMPORG2-superJumbo.jpg\n\nhttp://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170127132729-01-trump-tower-desk-file-super-tease.jpg\n\nhttp://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.11887390.1478716091!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/ipad_1536/image.jpg\n\nCompare that to Trump at about age 35-40 where his desk was actually full of work related shit, not marketing tools. \n\nhttp://www.nowaytrump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Trumps-Office-Trump-Tower-1987.jpg'

'How Trump caused the shutdown:\n\n>[As the meal progressed](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/us/politics/trump-government-shutdown.html), an outline of an agreement was struck, according to one person familiar with the discussion: Mr. Schumer said yes to higher levels for military spending and discussed the possibility of fully funding the president’s wall on the southern border with Mexico. In exchange, the president agreed to support legalizing young immigrants who were brought to the United States as children.\n\n>Mr. Schumer left the White House believing he had persuaded the president to support a short, three to four-day spending extension to finalize an agreement, which would also include disaster funding and health care measures.\n\n>“In my heart, I thought we might have a deal tonight,” Mr. Schumer recalled later, as he described the negotiations in remarks on the floor of the Senate.\n\n>Then everything fell apart.\n\n>On Friday, when Mr. Schumer was back on Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump called Mr. Schumer, a person familiar with the call said, and told him he understood they had agreed on a three-week spending deal, not three or four days. Mr. Schumer told the president, the person said, that Democrats would oppose a three-week measure because they saw it as a delaying tactic.\n\n>A White House official said that Mr. Schumer raised the possibility of a one or two-day extension, but Mr. Trump told Mr. Schumer to work out the details of a short-term measure with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.\n\n>A short time later Mr. Schumer called the president, the person said, but the conversation drove the pair even further apart. The immigration concessions from Democrats were not conservative enough, Mr. Trump told Mr. Schumer. The president said he needed more border security measures as well as more enforcement of illegal immigration in parts of the country far from the border.\n\n>As the evening wore on, Mr. Schumer got a call from Mr. Kelly that dashed all hopes for a Trump-Schumer deal before the shutdown deadline of midnight. Mr. Kelly, a hard-liner on immigration, the person familiar with the call said, outlined a long list of White House objections to the deal.'

His crimes against you are some of the many he's committed both before and after election and unfortunately the wheels of justice turn slowly. \n\nWe will all have our day for his crimes against the citizens of this country and you will have your day as well.  When indictments begin the rats will desert the sinking ship and then he'll be the one defending himself,  instead of his victims.  "

'Hello future college researchers looking for contemporary research on the Russia election interference scandal!\n\nHere\'s some useful information for you on how everyone is feeling right now:\n\n1) Vindication is in the air. Up to this point, the entire scandal had been dismissed by those furthest right as a hoax or "fake news." Even as others fell before this (Gates, Papadopalous, Manafort), this is a member of the cabinet pleading guilty and cooperating. You can attempt a spin, but you can\'t just dismiss this anymore as a haox.\n\n2) There\'s some betting going on whether or not Trump finishes his term that now has a side bet that he finishes by Christmas (it\'s December 1 now). That should be indicative on how much confidence there is that this investigation is picking up steam.\n\n3) Something cultural, I guess. Hmm. Well, the Avengers: Infinity War trailer just came out. People are hyped about that. Rick and Morty is very popular. Game of Thrones is putting together the final season. I dunno what\'s useful for future-folks, so I\'m just kinda guessing. I hope the future is good for you! I hope you still have tacos!'

Cash buy outs from shell companies of his properties? If that’s not a red flag I don’t know what is. To think that if he was never president no one would be the wiser to these issues is concerning. \n\nRepublican or Democrat, I’d vote for any candidate who seems earnest and most headstrong on anti corruption. **It’s the single biggest thing we can do to improve everything**\n\nMy biggest hope is a 2020 candidate who will rail on corruption as hard as Trump railed on the wall, “fake news”, and immigration. I am disheartened though, to my knowledge it has been **no ones** game plan. And for some god awful reason I don’t know why.

'\n>"...Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don\'t want to act, or even talk, alone; you don\'t want to \'go out of your way to make trouble.\' Why not?-Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.\n\n>Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, \'everyone\' is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You know, in France or Italy there would be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences; in Germany, outside the great cities, perhaps, there is not even this. In the university community, in your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, \'It\'s not so bad\' or \'You\'re seeing things\' or \'You\'re an alarmist.\'\n\n>And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can\'t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don\'t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have....\n\n>But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That\'s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked-if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in \'43 had come immediately after the \'German Firm\' stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in \'33. But of course this isn\'t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.**\n\n>And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying \'Jewish swine,\' collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in-your nation, your people-is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way."\n\n*-Milton Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans 1933-1945*'

'\nStealing this from @SethAbramson.\n\nFirst, it\'s important to understand that Mueller has entered into a plea deal with Flynn in which Flynn pleads guilty to far less than the available evidence suggests he could be charged with. This indicates that he has cut a deal with Mueller to cooperate in the Russia probe.\n\nWe\'ve already seen Mueller do this once before in the probe, with George Papadopoulos—who was charged with the same crime as Flynn, Making False Statements, to secure his cooperation with the Russia probe. The Papadopoulos plea affidavit emphasized facts were being left out.\n\nFlynn is widely regarded as dead-to-rights on more charges than Making False Statements—notably, FARA violations (failing to register as a foreign agent of Turkey under the Foreign Agent Registration Act). There\'s recently been evidence he was part of a kidnapping plot, too.\n\nGetting charged with just one count of Making False Statements is a great deal for Mike Flynn—it doesn\'t necessarily mean he\'ll escape incarceration, but a) it makes that a possibility (depending on what the parties and judge say and do), and b) any time served may be minimal.\n\nWhat this suggests is Flynn brings substantial inculpatory info (info tending to incriminate others) to the table. Unlike Papadopoulos, Flynn was going to be—because of his position in the administration—a primary target of the probe. So he had to offer a lot to get this deal.\n\nDeals like this are offered *only* when a witness can incriminate someone "higher up the food-chain" than them. In the case of the nation\'s former National Security Advisor, the *only* people above him in the executive-branch hierarchy are the President and the Vice President.\n\nThere may be other targets in the Russia probe—such as Attorney General Sessions—at Flynn\'s same level in the hierarchy, but unless he could incriminate two or more of them, a deal like this would not be offered to him. And there *aren\'t* two or more at his level in this case.\n\nWhat this indicates—beyond any serious doubt—is the following: Special Counsel Bob Mueller, the former Director of the FBI, believes Mike Flynn\'s testimony will *incriminate* the President of the United States, the Vice President of the United States, or both of these two men.\n\nFor this reason, what\'s about to happen is far and away the biggest development thus far in the Trump-Russia probe, and likely the biggest development in U.S. politics since President Nixon resigned from office during the Watergate scandal. \n\nThis is historic.'

Let's roll this fucker back to 2016, change and hope and all that rot. \n\n*Just venting here* I completely agree, a do-over is outside the bounds of our Constitution and sets a precedent (like others in the past) that would weaken our nation.

'Just a reminder about how the President tried to obstruct this investigation:\n\n>Trump reportedly attempted to persuade the FBI to drop its investigation into Flynn’s conduct. In a Feb. 14 meeting at the White House, Trump reportedly told then-FBI Director James Comey to “let this go.”\n\n>“I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,” Trump told Comey, according to a memo Comey wrote afterwards, which was later described by the New York Times. “He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.”'

"Folks, this is a big deal. Not only does this conclusively prove that Russian Intelligence actively supported the Trump campaign and attacked the Clinton Campaign, the indictment also says that:\n\nA) Someone in Trump's inner circle had contacts with Russian intelligence and (p.16) and B) a GOP candidate personally solicited stolen documents from Russian intelligence.

Many of these officials are known to currently work in the White House/Trump Administration. The thing is though, they clearly don\'t know what other emails Mueller may have... but if Mueller got their communications from the ptt.gov host, then it would be a safe bet that Mueller can get ALL of those emails (if he hasn\'t already done so already).\n\n-\n\nSo... guess who else was part of the [Trump transition team?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_transition_of_Donald_Trump) Numerous GOP Congresspeople, including some on powerful House Committees:\n\n-\n\n* Rep.

Providing text to spare the click. \n\n> A lawyer for the Trump presidential transition team is accusing Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office of inappropriately obtaining transition documents as part of its Russia probe, including confidential attorney-client communications and privileged communications.  \n> \n> In a letter obtained by Fox News and sent to House and Senate committees on Saturday, the transition team’s attorney alleges “unlawful conduct” by the career staff at the General Services Administration in handing over transition documents to the special counsel’s office.\n> \n> Kory Langhofer, the counsel to Trump for America, wrote in the letter that the special counsel’s office is aware that the GSA “did not own or control the records in question.”\n> \n> But, Langhofer says, Mueller’s team has “extensively used the materials in question, including portions that are susceptible to claims of privilege.”\n> \n> The special counsel’s office did not immediately return a request for comment Saturday. \n> \n> The Trump transition team lawyer argued the actions “impair the ability of future presidential transition teams to candidly discuss policy and internal matters that benefit the country as a whole.” \n> \n> Langhofer requests in the letter that Congress “act immediately to protect future presidential transitions from having their private records misappropriated by government agencies, particularly in the context of sensitive investigations intersecting with political motives.”\n> \n> The letter was sent to the Senate Homeland Security and House Oversight Committees.\n> \n> The committees did not immediately return a request for comment.\n'
'Mueller literally cleaning house of corrupt politicians. This may be the best thing to happen to the US government in a long time. '
'Americans shouldn’t hope for impeachment— they should hope for the truth. Whatever that may be. '
'Just to recap from the Buzzfeed article in another thread:\n\n>Specifically, Loewentritt said, "in using our devices," transition team members were informed that materials "would not be held back in any law enforcement" actions.\n\n>Loewentritt read to BuzzFeed News a series of agreements that anyone had to agree to when using GSA materials during the transition, including that there could be monitoring and auditing of devices and that, "Therefore, no expectation of privacy can be assumed."\n\n>Loewentritt told BuzzFeed News that the GSA initially "suggested a warrant or subpoena" for the materials, but that the Special Counsel\'s Office determined the letter route was sufficient.\n\nAnyone that says the emails were attained illegally is just pulling talking points from the right.'

She has realistic suggestions to improve the situation and keep people alive, rather than just saying "not enough is being done". In her CNN interview yesterday, she THANKED Trump for what he\'s done so far, and then re-enforced how bad the situation actually is and how much more help is needed. \n\nFor him to shit talk a woman who is giving her heart, soul, blood, sweat, and tears into helping her people is DESPICABLE. His ego won\'t let him so anything but trash talk, and people are dying as a result. Fucking asshole. '

"I don't know how true this is because it was told to me by someone works with the military, but it's not the costs of providing the care so much as the means.

They happily dismiss fiscal conservatism when it allows them to push their fascist social conservative (i.e. theological) world-view on others.  "
"This has nothing to do with cost.  It's about what the alt right sees as ethical and moral.  \n\n-Providing health care prescribed by a doctor for people who fight to keep us free: UNETHICAL/IMMORAL. \n\n-The president using federal funds to pay his own company for him to take weekends off at an expensive resort, while also having national security meetings in an unsecure environment:  ETHICAL/MORAL/ACCEPTABLE/ENCOURAGED.  \n\nThe Republicans can either separate themselves from this by publicly repudiating and removing the president,  or they can be branded as the party that caused it to happen.

'>“He refuses to sit still,” the presidential adviser said. “He doesn’t think he’s in any legal jeopardy, so he really views this as a political problem he is going to solve by himself.” . . . Because Trump believes he is innocent, some advisers explained, he therefore does not think he is at any legal risk for a coverup. In his mind, they said, there is nothing to conceal. \n\nIt sounds to me like Trump\'s advisers have spent way, way too much time justifying his INCREDIBLY SUSPICIOUS behavior to themselves. \n\n"He\'s just doing this because of how incredibly innocent he is," they chuckle, somewhat manically. "He\'s not acting guilty, he\'s acting *innocent*, because a guilty man would never act so incredibly motherfucking guilty, ha ha hahahahaha"---at which point the nervous laughter descends into uncontrolled sobbing.'
"This is why we shouldn't elect people that know nothing about politics. At best, Trump doesn't understand that how things look are very important in politics. We need an adult in the White House."
"So, I think it's pretty safe to say that Trump was at least on conference call for the meetings and it likely was recorded by both our intelligence and the Russians, and possibly others."

'I want to clarify something.\xa0 In times of chaos there are oportunist that surface, for example the looters we see on TV.\xa0 The more nefarious ones are people that are placed in positions of power that misguidedly use their position to benefit a cause or a specific population; these people are the oil that allows corruption to be part of the fabric of a country.\xa0 These are the \'Joe Arpaio\'s of the world.\xa0\xa0 Puerto Rico is not immune to favoritism and crime, and this is why a strong presence of an unbiased military presence is needed.\xa0 Through the process of getting out of chaos expert tactical logisticians are needed; we cannot relegate the responsibility to untrained personnel.  There are vested interest on all sides, let us focus on getting the help where it is needed with accountability and once stabilized  invite all the other conversations.\n\n...............\n\nExcerpt:\xa0\xa0\xa0 "Eight days after the storm\'s landfall, Puerto Rico had just 4,400 service members participating in federal service operations to help the island of 3.5 million. Compare that to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, when the United States sent 22,000 troops.\n\nHere\'s where President Trump spent his week as Puerto Rico crumbled.\n\n- Flying to his golf club\n\n- Having dinner at the club to talk about an immigration ban\n\n- Campaigning for Luther Strange in Alabama\n\n"Trump campaigned for his candidate last weekend at a rally at Alabama, using the opportunity to call football players "sons-of-bitches."\n\n- Tweeting at the club about the NFL\n\nTrump spent last weekend tweeting about the NFL #TakeAKnee protests, John McCain\'s unwillingness to sign Graham-Cassidy, and North Korea\'s "Little Rocket Man." Right around the time of his tweets, federal officials were preparing to evacuate upwards of 70,000 people living near a cracking dam. 10 people were reported dead. \n\n"Hysteria is starting to spread," Mayor Jose Sanchez Gonzalez of Manati said then.\n\n- At the White House, complaining about John McCain\n\n- Campaigning for tax cuts for the 1% in Indiana \n\nTrump traveled to Indiana on Wednesday to tout his new tax reform, which would provide a significant boost to upper income earners. \n\nHe refused to waive the Jones Act at that time, which would have made it easier for ships to dock in Puerto Rico. 97 percent of Puerto Rico did not have electricity at the time of the President\'s trip.\n\nAs of now, President is at the Bedminster Golf Course in New Jersey. This is his 66th trip to a golf course as President.\n\n\n...............\n\nMy personal note -  This is not just Trump but an administration\'s problem including  Republican, Democrats and others.   We are facing possible nuclear threats from North Korea, we have ISIS and Russia plotting on how they can unstabilize the US/world.\xa0 Think well and hard if the people you elected have the preparedness to make the correct decisions on our best interest.  \n\n'

"Just saw Rubio on Face the Nation. When John asked him about Trumps tweet storm he said he hadn't paid attention to that and we needed to focus on the help getting to PR. This is true to an extent. However, it would be nice if the Republican Party called out Trump any time for his despicable comments. Maybe he didn't read the Presidents tweets but I find that hard to believe. And it feels like they are talking out of both sides of their mouths. You can't say how much people need help when the man with the largest bully pulpit is calling those people lazy and unwilling to help with their own care when that is what they have been doing since day one of this tragedy. Trump can't take criticism, and apparently the Republicans can't give him any, even when it is deserved. "

The FBI cannot search anyone\'s home without permission. So when you hear a news story about a "raid" like today\'s story about the "raid" on Manafort\'s home last month, that means that the FBI sought and obtained a search warrant. To obtain a search warrant, a federal prosecutor will work with a FBI agent to write an affidavit in which the agent explains under oath the evidence that the agent believes shows probable cause that searching the residence will uncover evidence of a crime.\n\n"Probable cause" basically means that there is a good reason to believe that is the case. Why would the FBI want to search the home of a subject like Manafort? Because there may be documents, ledgers, and other records. More importantly, there may be computers and other digital media that contain communications. \n\nIt would be possible for the government to obtain many of these records by issuing a subpoena, which is less work and less costly than a search warrant. So why go with the search warrant? Two reasons come to mind. First, Manafort could have taken the Fifth as to the production of documents because the act of producing them would itself reveal criminal wrongdoing. Second, the government might be concerned that if they issued a subpoena they would not receive all of the evidence. Otherwise you would typically use a subpoena in a case like this. It\'s also possible that they\'re just being extra careful, given the importance of the investigation. They don\'t have to justify to the judge WHY they\'re seeking a search warrant instead of issuing a subpoena. They just have to show probable cause.\n\nIt\'s worth noting that the FBI will provide Manafort with a copy of the warrant, which will contain a list of items that the FBI is authorized to seize. That list will generally indicate what crime the FBI is investigating and will give a good sense of what the FBI is looking at. In other high profile cases, those search warrant details have been uncovered by the press. Could happen here.\n\n------'

"I'm sure that some people will use this as an opportunity to discredit Mueller's team for leaking, but I think their ability to keep knowledge of an FBI raid on a prominent Trump campaign official out of the media for this long is a testament to their professional discretion.\nEven with the intense journalistic focus on the investigations into the president and his campaign, Mueller successfully concealed this for nearly *an entire Mooch-and-a-half*."

'>The lawsuit, filed by state Attorney General Barbara Underwood, comes after an investigation spurred by The Washington Post’s reporting.\n\n>The suit accuses President Trump and his three eldest children of repeatedly misusing his nonprofit, including to pay off his businesses’ creditors, decorate one of his golf clubs and stage a multimillion-dollar giveaway at his 2016 campaign events.\n\n>Underwood asked a state judge to dissolve the Donald J. Trump Foundation, to distribute its remaining $1 million in assets to other charities, and to force Trump to pay at least $2.8 million in restitution and damages. She also asked that the president be banned from leading any other New York nonprofit for 10 years.\n\ndo they know how cheap they\'re going to look if they fight this? \n\nalso, wasn\'t the ~~judge~~ Attorney General JUST put in? good for her!\n\nSo the total number of legal actions against Trump is now:\n\n* the emoluments case\n* the whole Mueller shebang\n* the SDNY case\n* Stormy Daniels\n* Summer Zervos\n* ~~Karen McDougal~~ she settled, and can now talk about the affair\n* . . . and now this\n* Colin Kaepernick (reminder that we can, constitutionally, *burn* the flag, but not kneel for it?)\n* Trump University\n\nWhat did I forget? edit, courtesy of gnome_anne: "**About 150+ lawsuits.** At the end of the Fourth Estate (can’t recommend enough) they had text on the screen saying he was getting sued by, like, 200 or so different parties."\n\n>At one point, during a deposition, a New York state investigator asked Allen Weisselberg — a Trump Organization employee who was also listed as treasurer for the Trump Foundation — if the foundation had a policy for determining which specific payments the foundation was allowed to make.\n\n>“There’s no policy, just so you understand,” Weisselberg said. The interviewer asked if Weisselberg had understood he was actually on the board of the Trump Foundation, and had been for more than a decade.\n\n>“I did not,” Weisselberg said.\n\nSo, to paint the picture, the non profit has actually been unmonitored and run basically by whoever has the Trump\'s checkbook for over a decade'

It's incredibly important and completely damning.\n\nhttp://www.pulitzer.org/winners/david-fahrenthold\n\nAfter reading, you'll wonder why the fuck the rest of the media and the Democrats weren't talking about this nonstop. It's such a clear and obvious case of illegal activity on Trump's part. Read it. \n\nHere's a sample:\n\n>The Trump Foundation appeared outwardly to be a typical, if small, philanthropic foundation — set up by a rich man to give his riches away.\n\n> In reality, it has been funded largely by other people. Tax records show the Trump Foundation has received $5.5 million from Trump over its life, and nothing since 2008. It received $9.3 million from other people.\n\n> Another unusual feature: One of the foundation’s most consistent causes was Trump himself.\n\n> New findings, for instance, show that the Trump Foundation’s largest-ever gift — $264,631 — was used to renovate a fountain outside the windows of Trump’s Plaza Hotel.\n\n> Its smallest-ever gift, for $7, was paid to the Boy Scouts in 1989, at a time when it cost $7 to register a new Scout. Trump’s oldest son was 11 at the time. Trump did not respond to a question about whether the money was paid to register him.\n\n> At other times, Trump used his foundation’s funds to settle legal disputes involving Trump’s for-profit companies and to buy two large portraits of himself, including one that wound up hanging on the wall of the sports bar at a Trump-owned golf resort. Those purchases raised questions about whether Trump had violated laws against “self-dealing” by charity leaders.\n"
'“Although Trump’s name is on the foundation, in recent years most of its money was not actually his. Trump did not give any donation to the Trump foundation between 2008 and 2015 — instead, its largest benefactors in recent years have been wrestling moguls Vince and Linda McMahon, who gave $5 million total in 2007 and 2009. Linda McMahon was later appointed by Trump as head of the Small Business Administration”\n\nPay to play!  Welcome to Trump’s presidency.'
"But what about the Clinton Foundation and all that Uranium? Where are those charges?!?!?!?\n\nEdit: guess I should've tagged it, christ. haha /s"
'From CNN:\n>[In recent years, Trump\'s foundation has disbursed money to dozens of organizations, some with connections to Trump, such as $100,000 donated in 2012 to the Citizens United Foundation.](https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/12/politics/donald-trump-foundation-charity/index.html)\n\nThis should piss everyone off, regardless of political affiliation. Dude literally funded Citizens United with his charity. Do you think the Citizens United SCOTUS ruling was "charitable?"'
"It did. It has been for a long time. This shouldn't haven taken this long to identify and prosecute, but thank God the day has come! I'm hoping that this is the first of many significant criminal lawsuits brought upon this President and his sham of an administration. We still have to do our duty, get out there and **VOTE**, to make sure this asshole and his asshole family finds themselves behind bars. "
'A surprise, but a welcome one.'
">Underwood said that oversight of spending at Trump’s foundation was so loose that its board of directors hadn’t met in 19 years, and its official treasurer wasn’t even aware that he was on the board.\n\nLMAO. The BEST people.\n\nCould you imagine if this happened to the Clinton's over the Clinton Foundation? Right-wing media would be foaming at the mouth like a rabid dog."
'What a great birthday gift!'
'The best part of his tweet is that it is entirely a lie. Schneiderman and the democrats had nothing to do with this case.'
"Having a self portrait made and hung in one of your own facilites doesn't seem to be like charity work to me.    Looks like this charity was a slush fund."
'New York... I... I love you.'
'>“He said, ‘I’m going to write you a check out of my personal account for $25,000,’ and I was just floored,” Baldridge said. “I could not believe he was saying that, and I wish I had it recorded because the man did say this. He said, ‘No other president has ever done something like this,’ but he said, ‘I’m going to do it.’ “\n\n>The White House declined to comment on Baldridge’s account.\n\nWell I definitely want to hear more, please. '
"As David Fahrenthold reported last July, [Trump also promised to donate $250,000 to a charity helping Israeli soldiers and their families. He never did](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/14/donald-trump-once-promised-to-donate-to-a-charity-helping-israeli-soldiers-he-didnt-somebody-else-paid-for-him/?utm_term=.c31b44f4c796&tid=sm_rd). Another unknown person paid off Trump's promise."
'>In his call with Trump, Baldridge, a construction worker, expressed frustration with the military’s survivor benefits program. Because his ex-wife was listed as their son’s beneficiary, she was expected to receive the Pentagon’s $100,000 death gratuity — even though “I can barely rub two nickels together,” he told Trump.\n\n>The president’s response shocked him.\n\n>“He said, ‘I’m going to write you a check out of my personal account for $25,000,’ and I was just floored,” Baldridge said. “I could not believe he was saying that, and I wish I had it recorded because the man did say this. He said, ‘No other president has ever done something like this,’ but he said, ‘I’m going to do it.’"\n\n\nGet this man in front of every camera in the United States, right fucking now. '
'Conservatives: stop saying this man cares about the military and their families and accept that he sees them only as props to position himself as compassionate and powerful.'
'I’m not even shocked, mad at him anymore but the 35-40 % of morons who still excuse everything he does. His approval ratings have been stable there.\n\nFuck everyone'
'His supporters will be OK with this. He says what he means unless he doesn’t, and that’s just fine. \n\nTrump is every boss who laid you off, denied you a bonus, or froze raises while pocketing more cash than he did last year. \n\nHe’s the sociopathic executive his supporters want to believe in. Their entire world would come crashing down if they accepted that the people with power over them only want to hurt them. \n\nThey need to believe in Trump to believe that they haven’t been living in a game rigged against the middle and working classes. They can’t wake up to the fact the *real* American Dream is inherited power, connections and a dash of luck. They generally have none of that. To admit it would be to admit they’re powerless, exploited and bought into a lie. '
"Bet he figured he'd dig into the Trump Foundation but realized it was still under investigation, he can't access those funds so hoped this would just go away."
'Trump has a history of stiffing his contractors. This is clearly no different. Did anyone seriously think that he cared about the troops? He cares about them only to the point that talking about them scores him political points with his base, nothing more. '
'This article and the related discussion must really be getting under his skin.  I\'m sure he\'ll tweet something about the "fake news WaPo" soon, if he hasn\'t already.\n\nHe\'ll never understand that this is a can of worms that he opened.  This is his doing for being a small person to begin with.  He didn\'t have to stand up there and say, in effect "I treat gold star families better than other presidents did".  He is a very shallow person, both intellectually and emotionally.  How does everyone not this see by now?'
"This is not the first time Trump has promised money that got him free news coverage and warm and fuzzy feelings with the American public to then [not follow through](https://www.rawstory.com/2017/08/trump-pledged-1-million-but-hurricane-sandy-survivors-are-still-waiting-on-his-pledge/).\n\nSo my question becomes: Should the media even be covering these types of promises until there is a check in hand and the donation is verified? or how do we prevent Trump from taking advantage of innocent people without any repercussions?\n\nTrump has a history of promising x amount of dollars for an outcome and then either renegotiating or not paying that dollar amount with [contractors](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/09/donald-trump-unpaid-bills-republican-president-laswuits/85297274/) or [vendors]( https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/09/28/i-sold-trump-100000-worth-of-pianos-then-he-stiffed-me/), so it is not like this behavior is new or aberrant. Trump knows he can get an outcome without needing to pay for it. His [own lawyers have sued him](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/trump-files-time-trumps-lawyers-sued-trump/) for money due to them, and [he laughs about how easy it is](http://fortune.com/2016/09/30/donald-trump-stiff-contractors) to stiff people because of the nature of our justice system, which I would argue, he takes advantage of, at the taxpayers' cost. "
'Amazing how gold star families across the country are conspiring to defame the honorable never lying 100% ethical Donald Trump. Sad!'
'**He already said what he\'ll do...everyone needs to pay attention!!**\n\n>"I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election, **if I win**," - Donald J. Trump 2016\n\nIf the Republicans stay in power, he will continue to deny Russian interference. \n\nHowever, if the Dems take control in the midterms he will call it cheating, blame it on Russian interference and do everything in his power to invalidate the results. And his base will eat it right up. \n\nHe wants power at any cost, no matter what. The Republicans are happy to conspire with him so long as they have power too. \n'
' I wrote this a week ago...\n\nWait until there is a \'blue wave\' Democrat blowout in November. This will be claimed to be evidence of Russian collusion on behalf of the Democratic party by the Republicans.\n\n"Wait, so now your party won, and all of a sudden Russia is not meddling anymore?" "Nice try, libs." "We have to protect our democracy against foreign adversaries interfering..." (etc.)\n\nFurthermore, evidence will be provided to *prove* that the Russians interfered in the American electoral process, only this time they will be super obvious about it. Maybe even throw in a complicit candidate or two (phony dems?)\n\n"As I said many times, just so you understand, Russia interfered with our elections in the past and they continued to compromise our beloved process. The IC even told me so, before after the very successful Helsinki Summit! As president, it\'s my duty to defend the nation against enemies both foreign and domestic. In fact, the cooked dems even tweeted this at me many times, while blaming me! Sad!"\n\n"I, Donald Trump, will be recommending the creation of a special election investigation committee, I call it the USA Freedom Commission. You like that? Yeah, the USA Freedom commission. It\'s a good name right?... Headed by Devin Nunes, the great, isn\'t he great? the great Devin Nunes... to once and for all, get to the bottom of this Russia interference, and sniff out all the rats in the Democratic Party. We need to figure out what the hell is going on!"\n\n\\*Cheers. Lock them up! Lock them up....\\*\n\nEasy. The rest writes itself...\n\nA total fantasy. Good thing the GOP would never stoop so low as to secretly conspire against their own nation just to have power.'
'Tinfoil hat time, but I\'m pretty certain this is *exactly* what will happen. Russia will interfere on the side of Democrats, but they\'ll do it poorly and they\'ll do it obviously, so they\'re sure to be caught while having minimal impact, even while the meddle on behalf of Republicans far more subtly.\n\nThen Trump can come out and say "See, it\'s the *Democrats* who are colluding, not me!", and use it as an excuse to A) claim the Mueller investigation is a witch hunt, and B) screw around with our election apparatuses. He\'s going to use it as grounds to attack the legitimacy of Democrat elected officials, and anyone else who he sees as "the enemy", and his supporters will of course eat it right up.\n\nDecent chance, by the way, that this was precisely what he and Putin talked about when they met in Helsinki.'
'Vladimir Putin, [one week ago](https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1018886034887725057):\n\n>Reporter: Did you want President Trump to win the election?\n>\n>President Putin: "Yes I did. Yes I did. Because he talked about bringing the US-Russia relationship back to normal."'
'Remember the SNL skit that zooms out to the entire world laughing after Trump said "Nobody treats women better than I do"?\n\n\nThat. We need to play that clip right now.'
"Trump is giving himself the perfect out:\n\nIf the 2018 elections get the blue wave that we expect, he gets to claim they were rigged and, therefore, invalid.  Same goes for 2020.\n\nEven though we know from Putin, mind you, that Russia wants Republicans to win, he gets to still claim this and his base will eat it up.\n\nTurning this around on the Democrats, he will say something about how Dems have been saying for months that Russia interferes with our elections.  But, when he agrees with them, except instead saying it's for the purpose of helping Dems, it'll look to his base like he's cornering them and exposing them as hypocrites.\n\nThis gives him an out to invalidate all elections that do not favor Republicans and his base will be mad at Dems for looking like hypocrites, thereby strengthening Trump's authority to stay in office on his schedule.\n\nThis is a very scary precedent..."
'This is actually something I’ve feared. Putin got trump in the presidency to deteriorate western alliances and American democracy. What good does more republicans in office do for Putin when trump can do these things unilaterally? If I wanted to further erode American trust in elections, I would make it very obvious I was helping the democrats win. Not only are there not enough senate seats up to be able to hold trump accountable if the dems took them all, but republicans would then be able to play even more whataboutism/false equivalency games. Notice how almost this whole time trump has been saying “the real collusion is with the democrats.” This may be Putin’s plan, and trump may be in on it. If Putin has convinced trump helping the democrats could help solidify power for trump in the same way Putin did in Russia, trump would absolutely agree to it. Or it might not matter what trump wants if Putin has kompromat.'
'And he is so concerned about it, he removed the top Cyber Security officials, and did nothing when republicans pulled Security grants! '
"**America:** we think russia is going to interfere with our elections to help trump\n\n**Trump:** I also think russia is going to interfere with our elections but i think they will do it to help the dems and for that reason I'm still not going to impose sanctions on russia."
'I knew it. I Fucking knew it. I called this MONTHS ago. Watch out - it may lead to a postponing of elections so he can claim he\'s "sorting a free and fair election out" first.'
'Translation :  If the Democrats win, it is rigged!  If we win, the people have spoken!  '
'Well there we have it folks.  Now if Dems win big in November, he can claim it was the Russians and threaten to not recognize the election results.  Heck I wonder if Papa Putin said he would do something completely obvious to help the Dems so they can get caught and then Trump and the Republicans can point to it and go "See, the Democrats are the ones colluding!"'
"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. HE'S OVERRULING CONGRESS TO NOT IMPOSE SANCTIONS.\n\nWhat other evidence do we need? It's out there in plain sight. We don't need a dossier or a memo to tell he's in bed with the Russians. "
'I love how the talking points against the FBI and the dossier are wiped out almost daily. '
"> The FBI inquiry into alleged Russian collusion in the 2016 US presidential election has been given a second memo that independently set out many of the same allegations made in a dossier by Christopher Steele, the British former spy.\n\n> The second memo was written by Cody Shearer, a controversial political activist and former journalist who was close to the Clinton White House in the 1990s.\n\n> Unlike Steele, Shearer does not have a background in espionage, and his memo was initially viewed with scepticism, not least because he had shared it with select media organisations before the election.\n\n> However, the Guardian has been told the FBI investigation is still assessing details in the ‘Shearer memo’ and is pursuing intriguing leads.\n\n> One source with knowledge of the inquiry said the fact the FBI was still working on it suggested investigators had taken an aspect of it seriously.\n\n2pm edit: the way the main stream press is staying away from this story tells one something - they don't want to be associated with it. while it's nice  the fbi is still using it, finds it helpful, it appears the dossier is tainted by shearer and he casts more shadow on it than light.  \n\n3.44 edit: vox looks at the story:\nhttps://www.vox.com/world/2018/1/30/16951490/trump-russia-dossier-cody-shearer-memo-nunes"

"Preface: All of this is fact: pedophile Republicans are accepted by the party. The Senate and White House are a Republican majority. They were voted in by the majority of Americans.\n\nSee, the thing is, we already know most Americans are in favor of pedophiles (Republican majority, and that party is okay with it, and apparently most voters still vote Republican, see: Senate; see: President) so I'm guessing a Trump sex video with underage boys would likely be acceptable in the modern day Republican part of the USA.\n\nIt might become a problem if Trump is on video fucking and killing the underage sex slaves.\n\nMaybe. You never know with Republicans."

'Watergate would have been kicked under the rug too if Republicans and Southern Democrats didn’t risk the wrath of their constituents to enforce the rule of law.\n\nThe system doesn’t protect us, the people who enforce it do. Even men who supported segregation and the Vietnam war had enough insight to realize the risk of allowing Nixon to stay in office. The risk it posed to our nation.\n\nBut today, the last few types of these men are retiring or dying. This is why, despite how abhorrent I find some of the votes people like McCain and Flake have cast, I still applaud them when they speak out. Actions like that should be encouraged, rewarded. We need them. We cannot rely only on liberal opponents to keep the president in check.\n\nWhat a sad day.'

'>During Monday’s briefing, reporters repeatedly grilled Shah about what prompted Trump’s tweet promising to help ZTE — especially since the tweet came on the heels of a campaign in which Trump accused China of “the greatest single theft in the history of the world,” saying things like, “we can’t continue to allow China to rape our country.”\n\n>Shah had no good answers for them.\n\n>“This is part of a complex relationship between the United States and China that involves economic issues, national security issues, and the like,” Shah said at one point, in response to a question about what motivated Trump’s tweet.'

"A little bit of good old domestic bribery. Don't need a Special Counsel for that. This will not be the only case. Hopefully a good ten or twenty prosecutors pile on."
'I\'m old enough to remember this:\n\n[AT&T, Comcast giving $1,000 bonuses to hundreds of thousands of workers after tax bill](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/20/tax-reform-reaction-att-is-giving-bonuses-to-200000-employees.html)\n\n>"Congress, working closely with the President, took a monumental step to bring taxes paid by U.S. businesses in line with the rest of the industrialized world," CEO Randall Stephenson said in a statement. "This tax reform will drive economic growth and create good-paying jobs. In fact, we will increase our U.S. investment and pay a special bonus to our U.S. employees."'
'Trump supporters: wtf, I love pay to play now!'
"Wasn't AT&T also right out front making a big deal about giving out bonuses after the Republican Tax Bill.  \n\nNo coincidences."
'Wonder how much of that money Trump let Cohen keep, maybe 50 bucks?\n\ni.e:\n\n Trump: "Here Michael, go on and keep 50 bucks of that - order out a couple of nice pizzas for the family and a few bottles of Coke - on me!"\n\nCohen: "Oh, thank you master, thank you!!!" '
'> In a prepared statement to CNBC, the company said Cohen\'s firm "was one of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration." \n\nSo who were the other firms and what was paid for?  Did they really pay a similar amount of money to other firms just to get insights?? Like \\+$1 million for insights?'
"This is what Trump's swamp looks like. Grats on supporting it Trump cult members."
'College basketball prospects get taken out to dinner.... full scale FBI investigation.\n\n200k cash payment to someone with large influence over the president during time which they have large interest in being in their good graces.... new phone who dis?'
"$200k must have bought a pretty solid consulting report. Perhaps AT&T would publish the report? I think we'd all like some 'insight on the Trump administration'. And I for one would love to have a look at the work Essential Consultants does. Hottest consulting company in the biz right now. Those reports must be pretty flash."
'>AT&T said Cohen\'s company "was one of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration."\n\nOne of SEVERAL firms they engaged to provide INSIGHTS.  This was only ONE of the bribes they paid.'
'Witness tampering on top of Obstruction of Justice. Nice.'
'So should I take the amount of gold these headlines receive as a level of importance now?\n\n3x gold: read the headline, go straight to the comments.\n\n13x gold: go straight to controversial.'
'Trump basically donned a sandwich board sign, grabbed a bullhorn, and marched up and down Pennsylvania Avenue bellowing, "I"M OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE!!  SEE THIS JUSTICE RIGHT HERE, I"M OBSTRUCTING IT, YOU SUCKERS!!!"'
'These are the actions of an honest to god tyrant.\n'
'Hmm.  I thought Trump was innocent.  All his supporters say so!'
"I almost feel like it's a joke to think that Trump won't be charged with Obstruction. I mean, really. I feel like this isn't just 'wishful' thinking or us dumb libs trying to 'get him'. Like he legitimately seems like he ACTUALLY obstructed justice over and over and over again. I'm not missing something, am I?"

"Okay Muller is definitely going for obstruction charges.\n\nThis stuff is leaking out for one of three reasons:\n\n1. by Muller's team to get the public ready for the shock\n2. by Muller's team to get the partisans off their back\n3. by Trump's people to get their supporters primed and ready to downplay the charges and ignore the consequences"
'Remember when people said “Why vote? Both sides are basically the same”, and now we’re running out of Western allies, left the human rights council and started concentration camps for brown kids.

'Well thanks reddit for being so indisputably left winged.'
"I seriously don't understand the divide and how people see record low unemployment, lower taxes, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, repatriation of remains of US KIAs, factories reopening, etc as hallmarks of the worst president ever.   I realize you don't like the man but he's literally doing everything he promised on the campaign trail and those promises are what got him elected. \n\nEvery other politician forgets their promises the day they get into office. \n\nCan someone enlighten me?"

'I didn’t vote for him but... He’s actually, shockingly, one of the best! But please keep up your hyperbolic rhetoric.'
'Thank you for my daily dose of Liberal tears! I truly enjoy them!!'
"The hypocrisy on reddit is pretty incredible.  The wanna be intellectual left has lost their minds.  This is what the democrats want right?  Secure borders?  How do you think this happens? With cookies and rainbows?  At some point if you want to crack down on \nillegal immigration you have to be the bad guy.  Trump is just willing to be that bad guy.  I don't necessarily like it, but if it finally makes progress then it was probably the right decision."
'Yeah, when you equate nice and good with your political beliefs, sure president Trump is not nice or good. This just enforces the left wing echo chamber and is not going to win anyone over from the right.'
"Not really a good article at all.  I think it's way too slanted.\n\nNot what he says about Trump,  but he unfairly rags on Bush and Carter. \n\nCarter was / is a super intelligent guy, who appointed the wrong people to advise him.\n\nBush didn't bumble Katrina, FEMA did. And his post-911 period was actually very good and just what the country needed.\n\nTrump?  Well he clearly is only in it to set himself up for riches after he leaves office (via election,  impeachment or resignation).  I've never seen such an egomaniac like him in action before. And it's quite embarrassing. "
"As a Canadian who goes to the US every year, I'm taking a few years off. With friends like this..."
"Can we please have an end to this little boy getting whatever he wants? I had no idea that our Democracy was so fragile.

'I am a Bernie Sanders fan, and tariffs are one of the few areas where I separate myself from him, as he ran on tariffs as well.\n\nLook, I get the idea. It can *feel* like a good thing, especially when its framed as "protecting" business. But it just backfires. It raises prices, and while it might help the industry you "protect," it often hurts other industries. \n\n>A research paper titled “The Unintended Consequences of U.S. Steel Import Tariffs: A Quantification of the Impact During 2002” found that in 2002, more American workers lost their jobs due to higher steel prices than the total number employed by the U.S. steel industry itself.\n\nhttps://taxfoundation.org/lessons-2002-bush-steel-tariffs/'

'Serious question for conservatives/trump supporters:\n\nOne of the clips I\'ve seen played is of Obama agreeing to talk with "our allies as well as our enemies", immediately inter cut with a fox news analyst saying "he\'s agreeing to meet dictators without preconditions!!!"\n\nDid Obama ever claim this or act on this?  I\'m sure he met world leaders but I don\'t recall him ever agreeing to meet North Korea or a similar admin with no terms or preconditions set.'
'Funny thing is they gave it 1 day of coverage and now its not even the top story.  If they truly believed that the summit was as successful as Trump has claimed then it should be a 24/7 coverage piece.'
'I like how Obama, with help from 13 allies, got a treaty with iran. The right attacked him for it. Now praise trump for this. Funny How only 2 allies, Saudi and Israel, opposed the Iran deal and won under trump with those other 13 opposing. The 2 parties are hurting america at this point.'

I hope the voters take their country back but I have my doubts. \n\nDuring the GOP primaries I predicted Trump would win, and once he won I again correctly predicted he would beat HC.

"There seems to be  many double standards for Trump that a lot of conservatives have. What is really sad is that Obama is way more of a better president (and Hillary Clinton would've been a better president) than Trump. And as far as I know Obama never wanted Russia to rig any elections, never started trade wars with our long-term allies, etc... But you will never hear this from conservatives.\n\n"

And that, my little pedes, is a big fucking problem.  People don’t like being treated like imbeciles that are too dumb to know when they’re being lied to.  That’s how the President treats the people he’s supposed to serve.  '
'Cuomo is trying a little too hard to be “balanced” by almost defending Trump legal team lies. He is an amazing interviewer but Giuliani was clearly lying about the transcript. Lanny is even stating that you don’t even need to try to spin the context, literally use your ears to know that the transcript Trumps legal team provided is false. That is a fact.  \n\nOther than that he has been fair to grill Lanny about Cohen not being a sympathetic character in the grand scheme. Michael Cohen also doesn’t hold the nuclear codes. \n\nFor the life of me I can’t figure out why legally we have to treat Trump with kid gloves because he’s the President but when it comes to character we have to deal with him with kid gloves as well. The President can’t have it both ways\n\n'

'Ok, so Rudy Guilani has gone on Fox News and made an official statement claiming that Trump clearly says "don\'t pay with cash". I listened to the tape again and I wasn\'t sure, so I had to investigate to convince myself.\n\nI\'m no audio engineer but I enhanced the recording in Logic Pro X and slowed it down 40%, and with these modifications I think it becomes ABUNDANTLY CLEAR that Trump says "so we\'ll pay with cash".\n\nListen for yourself: https://soundcloud.com/arman-dezfuli-arjomandi/trump-cohen-leaked-tape-slowed-down-so-well-pay-with-cash\n\nEDIT: You might have to turn your sound all the way up.'

"The thing with John Dowd is that he is not a terrible lawyer.\n\nHe has represented some major cases, and for a good while he was regarded as one of the best lawyers in the US.\n\nHe is not stupid at all.\n\nThis goes to show just how much Trump is forcing his lawyers to do stuff they don't want to do and they just can't handle it any more.\n\nThis is his career history. I am sure you can also agree that this is not a stupid man.\n\nhttp://www.johnmdowd.com/\n\nThis is a man that wanted to represent a massive case, but then realised that he just can't do it based on who he is working for.\n\nIf only Trump would let him get on with what he does and the defence would have been at the least semi-decent. Trump seems to create incompetence no matter if the person who is representing him is competent. "
"When your head lawyer quits because he's constantly advising you to not speak to special counsel Mueller and you are so convinced that you are either innocent or above the law and immune from repercussions that you plan to sit anyway. . .\n\nYes, go sit down for that interview Trump. Make us all proud. Make America great again!"
'> Mr. Dowd, who took over the president’s legal team last summer, had considered leaving several times in recent months and ultimately concluded that Mr. Trump was increasingly ignoring his advice, one of the people said. \n\nJohn Dowd is the same guy that said this:\n\n> "I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe’s boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier.”\n\nHe sees the end game. Trump is fucked.'
'https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/972829763067883523\n\n> The Failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out. Wrong. I am VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow. They are doing a great job and.....\n\nDowd leaves 10 days later'
'Remember: protest PEACEFULLY at your congressional office. We must save our democracy from tyranny. The United States is not above succumbing to authoritarian rule if the people do not participate. '
"Funny - When Trump hires 'the best' people to work beneath him, they get fired.  When he hires 'the best' people to protect him, they quit.   "
'Can’t wait for all of trumps fan boys and talking media heads to now come out and say “we expected this all along. This was a good thing. We’re on track now”.\n\nFucking idiots.'
'Very surprising this is Dowd and not Cobb, who advised a more cooperative approach.\n\nSomething interesting happened behind the scenes.'
"So Trump's going from John Dowd, a conservative talk show host, to Joe diGenova, a frequent guest on conservative talk shows.  A step down.\n\nSeriously though, it's actually pretty astounding that this guy thought he had the capacity to call for the probe to be shut down a few days ago (not a small thing), and now isn't even on the team anymore."
"> The president was said to be pleased with Mr. Dowd’s resignation, as he had grown frustrated with him, particularly over the weekend when Mr. Dowd called on the Justice Department to end the special counsel investigation. Mr. Dowd said at first that he was speaking for the president, but later backtracked.\n> \n> The president was angered with Mr. Dowd’s handling of the episode, **telling people it was ham-handed and Mr. Dowd should not have backed off his initial statement.**\n\nSo Mr. Dowd was in fact speaking for the President and/or at the very least the President agreed with and would have said what Mr. Dowd called for...ending the Mueller investigation into Russia's interference with United States. Congrats Mr. President, you are once again proving yourself to be a traitor who does not care about investigating proven attacks on the United States of America."
'Dowd was his best lawyer, and it’s going to be hard to find a replacement when the recruiting pitch is :\n\n“Hey, would you like to join my legal team full of idiots and face Robert Mueller in court? Keep in mind, I will use Twitter to routinely torpedo any strategy you come up with.”'
'I hope Trump represents himself. A president should be able to lol'
'If anyone’s wondering, this is a completely normal thing that happens when a client doesn’t follow their lawyer’s advice. It’s part of why you keep good records of phone calls, emails and letters to clients. It’s also why you get a retainer up front, since anything can happen during legal representation and sometimes clients don’t want to pay their bills. \n\nI’m sure Trump will pay his attorneys everything he owes them, of course. He’s got a reputation for always paying his bills, and on time. '
"One would think that with the president's obvious intellect and his business acumen that he'd just want to get rid of all of his lawyers and represent himself as he navigates the complex web of potential legal snares. I, for one, would whole-heartedly endorse just such a plan and would enjoy seeing it come to fruition."
'> “I love the president,” Mr. Dowd said in a telephone interview. “I wish him the best of luck. ***I think he has a really good case.***”\n\n...Yeah so good that he realized he would lose.'
"Oh yeah....there's my F5 reward.  Whats it been like 2 hours since my last hit?"
'The fact he is surrounding himself with yes men and let Dowd go (who knew better than to let him sit with Mueller) either just strengthens the theory that Trump is a useful idiot and has no understanding of his role as Putin’s puppet OR he really does have the kind of delusions of grandeur that would lead him to believe he’s a match for Mueller.  '
'Is it just me, or is this all starting to accelerate? \n\nI hope this is all over soon. You can help! Vote!'

According to sources familiar with his investigation into alleged Russian election interference, his probe has enlisted the help of agents from the IRS’ Criminal Investigations unit.\n\n> This unit—known as CI—is one of the federal government’s most tight-knit, specialized, and secretive investigative entities. Its 2,500 agents **focus exclusively on financial crime, including tax evasion and money laundering.** A former colleague of Mueller’s said he always liked working with IRS’ special agents, especially when he was a U.S. Attorney.\n\n> **And it goes without saying that the IRS has access to Trump’s tax returns—documents that the president has long resisted releasing to the public.**\n\nThe tweetstorm this weekend is going to be amazing.\n\nWill also add that if Trump et al committed federal tax crimes they very likely committed state tax crimes as well. While shell corporations to launder money could be based somewhere other than New York, there must be some connection to New York because of the real estate dimension of Trump's business."
"So this is a Special Prosecutor's team consisting of the most talented legal minds in the country, who have worked on RICO, money laundering and tax fraud cases. They have a Russian language expert, too. They're utilizing two grand juries, one in Virginia and one in D.C. They're working with the New York Attorney General, and have the files of the former US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, where Trump Tower is located. They're also working with the FBI and now, as many have suspected, we know they're working with the IRS. \n\nMueller has one chance to take this guy down, and he knows it. He is building the mother of all cases to do it. It's going to be spectacular."
'>“From the agents, I know everyone has the utmost respect for both Mueller and Weissmann,” said Martin Sheil, a retired IRS Criminal Investigations agent.\nAnd he said Mueller and Weissmann are known admirers of those agents’ work.\n“They view them with the highest regard,” Sheil said. “IRS special agents are the very best in the business of conducting financial investigations. They will quickly tell you that it took an accountant to nab Al Capone, and it’s true.”\n\nAnd Mueller, like Eliot Ness... is untouchable. Get em boys. '
'I sincerely hope the man is under armed guard 24/7. I really worry for his safety considering all the people who could be implicated, as well as lone wolf vigilantes trying to protect their God Emperor. '

'Trumps IQ is probably so high that he can understand all of the jokes in Rick and Morty. To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer\'s head. There\'s also Rick\'s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they\'re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn\'t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick\'s existencial catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev\'s Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

Instead of expanding the electorate, Bannon and his team are trying to shrink it. “**We have three major voter suppression operations under way**,” says a senior official. They’re aimed at three groups Clinton needs to win overwhelmingly: idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans. Trump’s invocation at the debate of Clinton’s WikiLeaks e-mails and support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership was designed to turn off Sanders supporters. The parade of women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and harassed or threatened by Hillary is meant to undermine her appeal to young women. And her 1996 suggestion that some African American males are “super predators” is the basis of a below-the-radar effort to discourage infrequent black voters from showing up at the polls—particularly in Florida.\n\n> On Oct. 24, Trump’s team began placing spots on select African American radio stations. In San Antonio, a young staffer showed off a South Park-style animation he’d created of Clinton delivering the “super predator” line (using audio from her original 1996 sound bite), as cartoon text popped up around her: “Hillary Thinks African Americans are Super Predators.” **The animation will be delivered to certain African American voters through Facebook “dark posts”—nonpublic posts whose viewership the campaign controls so that, as Parscale puts it, “only the people we want to see it, see it.”** The aim is to depress Clinton’s vote total. “We know because we’ve modeled this,” says the official. “It will dramatically affect her ability to turn these people out.”\n\n-\n\n> Powered by Project Alamo and data supplied by the RNC and Cambridge Analytica, his team is spending $70 million a month, much of it to cultivate a universe of millions of fervent Trump supporters, many of them reached through Facebook. By Election Day, the campaign expects to have captured 12 million to 14 million e-mail addresses and contact information (including credit card numbers) for 2.5 million small-dollar donors, who together will have ponied up almost $275 million. **“I wouldn’t have come aboard, even for Trump, if I hadn’t known they were building this massive Facebook and data engine,” says Bannon.** “Facebook is what propelled Breitbart to a massive audience. We know its power.”\n\n-\n\n> Locations for the candidate’s rallies, long the centerpiece of his media-centric candidacy, are guided by a Cambridge Analytica ranking of the places in a state with the largest clusters of persuadable voters. \n\n[Inside the Trump Bunker, With Days to Go\n](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-27/inside-the-trump-bunker-with-12-days-to-go)"
'I don\'t know if anyone caught that **potential federal election law violation** but it\'s extremely suspicious the connection between the campaign and the superPAC through Bannon and Mercer.\n\nCambridge Analytica claimed they ran the entire digital campaign for Trump:\n\n>“We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting, we ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy," said CEO Alexander Nix, regarding Cambridge Analytica\'s work for Trump.\n\nWe know that a whistleblower for CA claims that they worked with Lewandowski and Bannon. Bannon was involved in setting up CA, and CA tested slogans that ended up becoming key campaign slogans of the Trump campaign as far back as 2014.\n\nWe also know that the senior management team of CA is on tape stating that they use proxies to distribute information.\n\nCambridge Analytica\'s major funder and Board Director is Rebekah Mercer. Rebekah Mercer funded the SuperPAC "Make America Number 1". We know that ads that the CA management team described were distributed by the SuperPAC funded by Mercer.\n\nCA admits to working both sides of the fence but claim they have a Chinese wall in place. However, the above certainly doesn\'t look like that\'s the case. About a year ago it was alleged that Bannon was improperly paid by the SuperPAC Make America Number One. The SuperPAC paid Bannon\'s production company Glittering Steel nearly $1 million during the campaign, starting in July 2015 and continuing through Bannon\'s tenure at the head of the campaign.\n\nFurther, CA senior exects are on video stating that their campaign work wasn\'t so much around being pro-Trump, but more so focused on an anti-Hillary message and trying to discourage people from voting for Hillary.  In June 2016 the PAC changed its name and its purpose to being anti-Hillary, just like CA\'s stated mission.  Politico reported the colloquial name of the PAC as the "defeat crooked Hillary PAC" which is the same slogan pioneered by CA.  David Bossie headed the PAC between June and August, 2016, before **leaving to become the Trump campaign\'s deputy campaign manager**.\n\nIt\'s also worth noting that Rebekah Mercer is also the funder of Breitbart news, Bannon\'s former media website.\n\nGoing deeper, it\'s recently been discovered that Trump\'s team is using ProtonMail accounts at the White House and has done so throughout the campaign. There\'s not anything inherently suspicious about using end to end encrypted email channels, except for the fact that in today\'s report CA senior executives promote ProtonMail specifically as a means of communicating with their clients.\n\nIf the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Make America Number 1 SuperPAC, that would be a violation of federal election laws.\n\n**EDIT:  It gets even better.**  An activist was working with Michael Flynn to find Hillary\'s emails.  Flynn had to file an amended disclosure to admit that he had worked with CA.  We know that Mueller is investigating Flynn\'s roles in the email scandal.\n\n1.  http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/379368-cambridge-analytica-executives-claim-they-ran-all-the-digital-campaign-for  \n2.  https://www.today.com/video/cambridge-analytica-whistleblower-says-the-company-worked-with-trump-campaign-strategist-and-steve-bannon-1189326915651  \n3.  https://www.fastcompany.com/40405915/trump-and-super-pac-may-have-violated-election-rules-says-watchdog-group  \n4.  https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/26/analysis-republican-donors-avoid-trump/86335080/  \n5.  https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-activist-who-sought-clinton-emails-cited-trump-campaign-officials-1498872923  \n6.  https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/04/michael-flynn-cambridge-analytica-disclosure'

'>On Russia investigation: “As one of the companies that played a prominent role in the 2016 election campaign, Cambridge Analytica is committed to supporting and assisting the House Intelligence Committee investigation into Russian interference in the election in any way that we can. CA is not under investigation, and there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by the company. They deny any involvement in the alleged Russian attempts and say such an allegation is entirely false.”\n\nWhat an interestingly parsed statement. Hahah how hilarious is it that they specifically referred to only the house Intel investigation, not the senate judiciary, senate Intel or Muellers. Also interesting that they change the subject of the sentence from "we" to "they". Who is "they" in the last sentence?

"'The president shouldnt get to nominate a Supreme Court Justice in his last year in office' - McConnell "
'I agree with this sentiment, but here\'s the thing, Mueller hasn\'t formally even said Trump is under investigation personally (he almost 100% is). So while I agree, unless the Special Counsel comes out and says, "Yes, this president is under direct investigation" that action has no legs to it.\n\nRemember, most of what we see with Mueller investigation has just been pure guesswork. They literally have kept the whole things under wraps. We get to see bits and pieces, as entities become known, but we literally have no idea about the scope, and how far reaching it goes. We can assume Trump is under direction scrutiny, and the Orange Baboon seems to think so, but nothing has been officially declared.'

"I empathize greatly with the viewpoint here. But consider:\n\nWhat if Hillary had won the election, and it came time for a supreme court nomination? What if the Republicans insisted on blocking the nominee until a full investigation of Benghazi and her private email server had been finished? And when they said finished, they didn't actually mean finished, they meant until the investigation (s) found what they wanted them to find. That's the danger of this sort of thinking. Investigations take as long as they need to. If you get politics involved, that either means there's incentive to drag things along (for instance, to block a supreme court nominee), or there's incentive to hurry (which could mean vital information gets passed over).\n\n\nI understand why you're asking for what you're asking for, but the larger ramifications need to be considered."

I\'d imagine appeals for integrity must fall on pretty deaf ears when *everyone* has been playing dirty for decades.'
"If we used this same logic, Trump shouldn't really allowed to be president, or make any decisions until he's proven innocent.  Why would we stop at a supreme court pick, and then allow him to make decisions about war, policy, or law?\n\nEither way, it doesn't make a lot of sense in the United States, because he's presumed innocent, until proven guilty.   If Mueller proves that he's committed a crime in regards to the presidency, then I absolutely agree he shouldn't be allowed to do any of the above.  Until then, he's to be presumed to be innocent and should be allowed to operate as such.   "
"No this is a terrible solution! The new Supreme Court pick either shouldn't happen before the midterms or should recuse from any case regarding the independent council.\n\nYou do not want anyone to be able to officially decide whether a Supreme Court pick is correct other than chosen representatives. This would create a precedent that is unnecessary and dangerous. I trust Mueller, but you have to think long term. The Russia investigation can be protected in better ways than this suggestion by USAtoday.. "

' I read both the White House’s readout and the Kremlin’s. Of course the Kremlin’s was a lot longer and more detailed (but truthful? Who knows about *that*). Neither one mentioned something that seems important to me. \n\nWho initiated the idea of meeting “sometime in the not too distant future?” \n\nTrump repeated that phrase three times during the presser. We know this phone call wasn’t on the official schedule. We know there have been rumors before of the administration attempting to disable recording of calls between the two and Putin not being confident that they weren’t being recorded (I have no idea whatsoever if this is true but I have read some articles about it). We know that Trump has a history of having unannounced side meetings with Putin at world summits; meetings where Trump doesn’t bring a translator. \n\nGiven everything we already know, I gotta ask: is it possible that Trump is the one who proposed the meeting during this call today? And if so, could it be because he really, really wants to talk to the Kremlin about something outside the ears of his cabinet, law enforcement, and U.S. intelligence? \n\nI have always believed that the whole “Russia, if you’re listening I hope you can find Hillary’s emails” statement was a public form of accepting Russia’s offer of cooperation to him. His campaign was approached and offered the quid pro quo setup, and when he was ready to “make a deal” ( 🙄this fucking guy) he made that statement at the rally. I think Jared Kushner’s attempts at backchannel communication, and its subsequent exposure, along with the white hot scrutiny of the press and Mueller, help explain why Trump would be motivated to do stupid shit like this. He has no remaining ways to communicate with Putin other than official channels.\n\nMaybe I’m jus a tinfoil hatter. Who knows. '

The loss of the personal exemption, which currently shields $4,050 of income from federal taxes for every household member also played a major role in increasing taxes for some households -- an effect that got worse over time, because the amount of the personal exemption kept pace with inflation.\n\n>**Meanwhile, 80 percent of the tax benefits would accrue to those in the top 1 percent -- households making more than about $900,000 a year, who would see their taxes drop by more than $200,000 on average.**  \n\nSome more context about the word, I\'d advise only using this source as a starting place to do more research into the etymology of the word but it provides a nice summary;\n\n[Kakistocracy: A word we need to revive](http://amroali.com/2016/05/kakistocracy-rule-by-the-stupid-unqualified/)\n\n\n\n>Kakistos means “worst” which is superlative of kakos “bad” (perhaps also related to “defecate”).

But kleptocracy is not the same as kakistocracy: They do both capture the element of least qualified or the worst, but with different meanings. Taking a reductionist stance for the sake of making the point, Putin’s regime is more of a kleptocracy, a regime ruled by thieves and thugs but that does not mean Putin is politically incompetent or stupid.

'Apparently being a legend in his own mind he feels that his HUGE popularity will garner the most votes.'
'Trump repeats a lot of lies, but one that he frequently repeats that really irritates me is "the electoral college favors the democrats". The electoral college favors small population states (and therefore republicans), as proven by the fact that he became president after getting crushed in the popular vote, and that Al Gore won the popular vote in 2000 but lost that election. If nothing is done, this pattern is likely to continue as Democrats become increasingly condensed into cities and coastal areas.\n\nPlease Trump, convince the Republican cronies to get rid of the electoral college! The Democrats would be completely on board.'
"I suppose he would say this since he's somehow convinced 3 million illegals voted for Hillary and that sans that, he actually won the popular vote. Go for it Donny. See what happens. "
"Well then, what do you know... I actually agree with the president on something (if he's not lying about supporting the popular vote over the EC).\n\nDeath to the Electoral College!  Support the [Popular Vote Compact](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact)!"
"Ugh. I don't necessarily like Trump, but you shouldn't attack him for this. His campaign was to win electors, not voters. He would have tried to win voters without the EC. It's not always bad to prevent something you did from happening again because sometimes that's the only way to do it. The general consensus is that the EC is bad anyway, so let's not hate on him for doing something we agree with.\n\nCriticize someone's wrongdoings, not what is right. If you criticize both, all you are doing is telling them right and wrong don't matter.\n\nIf you are for the EC, criticize him all you want. However, people that are against him criticizing this action aren't helping their own case.\n\nI'm not comparing Trump to Hitler to imply he is the next Hitler (He really isn't), but I want to use a figure that many people hate to put this in perspective. Despite being an all-around horrible person, Hitler did a few good things. They are few and far between, but criticizing him for those things is implying those things are bad. They are negligible for sure, but they are undeniable."
"Well if people actually took the time to read his quote, he said he would have ran a different campaign if it was popular vote that decided it.\n\nSo he's basically saying yes, he's all for the popular vote, but if that was the yard stick he would have ran a different campaign and won the popular vote against Hillary."
"I don't think we should switch away from the Electoral College\\-\\-although I do think it is, at present, a flawed system\\-\\-but if we set aside for a second the absurdity of him saying this after the 2016 election saw him lose the popular vote by \\~3 million, it is absolutely true that people would vote differently under a system where everybody's vote counted equally.\n\nThe gamesmanship involved with deciding whether or not to vote for the President is interesting.  If you are in a safe \\(R\\) state, should you even bother showing up to the polls if you want to vote for the Democratic candidate?  And, actually, if you're planning on voting for the Republican candidate, and you're in that safe \\(R\\) state, should even *you* bother showing up to the polls?  Sure, your vote will feel more important if it's for the winning candidate in your state, but ultimately if it's a safe state, your 1 individual vote didn't sway jack.\n\nBut there's no way he was intentionally referring to that side of the issue.  He doesn't seem capable."
'And even better would be using ranked choice voting to get rid of the problem of the president winning with less than half the vote and of votes to other parties being thrown away. \n\nIn RCV you rank your choices, if no one gets enough first choice votes to pass the 50% mark, the candidate in last place is eliminated and their votes are redistributed to their second choice, this process is repeated until someone passes the 50% mark. This system is used in Australia and many cities in the US already \n\nAlso it would mean the people like Bernie Sanders could run without taking votes away from people like Hilary (assuming many Bernie and Hilary supporters would put the other democratic candidates as their second choice) '
'Yes please, no more certain states deciding the election and the policies of the country. '
"If Bush had said that in 2000, I would have grudgingly respected him for supporting a change to a rule that had benefited him. With Trump, it's just an old guy randomly rambling."
'If we got rid of the EC, citizens in US territories would then be able to vote in presidential elections, right? Is Trump sure he wants the 3.3M people in Puerto Rico voting? Sounds great to me!'
"He's not being serious he's trying to create a narrative of false information that he won the popular vote"
"go for it.  I don't think there has been a republican win from popular vote since I have been alive.\n\nthey have all been decided by the EC"
'This guy honestly believes he won the popular vote. He honestly believe that "millions" of illegal voters changed the election numbers. It is amazing to me. '
"Not quite... this is that malicious sleight of hand we like to do in favor of our respective teams. One cant lose a popular vote if one isn't participating in a popular vote contest. Changing the rules changes the game and the players. \n\nJust look at this [map](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/8f1rk7/united_states_of_apathy_2016_us_presidential/) from reddit today. There are millions of votes left on the table. One reason **could** be that people don't bother voting in heavily biased states. I know I dont.\n\nAssuming Clinton would win based on the results of an election with different rules is probably not the best play."
'Id be really careful before cheering. This is an entire presidency where the president is simply doing the bidding of rich white donors. If Trump says get rid of electoral collage - I want you to keep in mind the near zero prep that his team has put fourth to secure the midterms from a confirmed attack. With this type of groupthink and general "yea yea lets do it!" I\'m afraid it\'s opening up an avenue for an alternative dark plan to take shape. I dont know how many realize the similarities bewteen Trump and \'evil leaders\' of year\'s past. They hate the press, they attempt to imprison their poitical criticizers and opponents, they go after the Justice Dept. They blame a certain race for all of their problems and work to get rid of them. Sound famililar? None of this is nation friendly.

'Man, I miss good old days when Republicans just did the meddling themselves.\n\nLike that time in 2000 when the co-chair of the George W. Bush Campaign in Florida was also the Secretary of State, meaning she was in charge of running the election. So she used her power to wrongly revoke the voting rights of thousands, if not tens of thousands, of mostly black eligible voters. Bush won by 537 votes. Oh yea, Jeb Bush was also governor at the time ([source](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/jun/09/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-revisits-floridas-2000-and-2004-vo/)).\n\nOr that time in 2004 when the honorary co-chair of the George W. Bush Campaign in Ohio (also a crucial swing state) was also the Secretary of State, and oversaw the disqualification of provisional ballots, underallocation of voting machines in predominantly black districts, and the creation of long lines (some lasting 10 hours) in heavily Democratic areas where as many as 129,000 decided to leave without voting. Bush won by 118,000 votes. As Secretary of State, he was sued at least 16 times over his mishandling of elections ([source](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/Ken_Blackwell.pdf)and [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_in_Ohio,_2004)).\n\nOr that time since 2010 when 22 Republican states (and 3 Democratic ones) made it harder to vote by cutting back early voting and voting hours, created more registration restrictions, and/or passed strict photo ID requirements, all of which has dissuaded mostly Democratic voters ([source](https://www.brennancenter.org/new-voting-restrictions-america)and [source](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/how-the-gop-rigs-elections-121907/)).'

'Would love to know what his liberal Dem parents think of the monster they created.\n\nTruly the scum of the earth.'
'Yes I lifted this from elsewhere-\n\nSo, the historical practice has been to separate children from parents if they were caught at the border and did not agree to voluntarily return. And by historical I mean that has been the practice since the start of the US.\n\nThe main reason this is done is procedural, if you are caught illegally crossing the border and refuse to voluntarily return then you have committed a crime and you get put into a Federal detention center. There is simply no other place to put people found illegally crossing the border.\n\nThe Federal Government operates separate detention centers for children and adults, and so they go to separate centers.\n\nThere are two reasons for that.\n\nThe first is that it simply isn\'t safe for children in the adult detention centers, since they are usually just general purpose jails.\n\nThe second is that forcibly deporting someone is a long and *very* expensive process. Separating families encourages people to voluntarily deport, which saves the US Government a lot of money and helps speed up the immigration process for everyone else.\n\nAlthough this practice has not changed, the way that illegal immigrants treat the system has. Historically the overwhelming majority of people caught at the border would simply agree to leave the country and that was the end of it.\n\nHowever, the Obama administration began allowing anyone who had made an asylum claim stay in the US so long as they had a relative or friend they could stay with. This resulted in almost every person who was caught at the border making an asylum claim.\n\nAlmost none of those claims are valid, but it takes 2-3 months for the claim to be denied and most people just disappear during that time.\n\nWhat the Trump administration has done is to grant border patrol officers the discretion to look at asylum claims being made by people being detained at the border. If the border patrol agent determines that the asylum claim has no merit, the person is treated like anyone else who was caught at the border and placed in a detention center while their asylum claim works its way through the legal system.\n\nA judge can still grant a person so detained asylum, but instances of that actually happening are almost non-existent.\n\nPeople that border patrol determines have a legitimate asylum claim are still permitted to stay with a family or friend if they have one available.\n\nPeople that agree to leave voluntarily are not put into detention centers, they mostly get held together in a cell at the facility where they were caught until transportation can be arranged to take them back, which might take a day or two depending on where they were caught. If they drove/walked into a border checkpoint, which is where many people are now getting "caught" they can just drive/walk back if they want.\n\nThis is not a change in any longstanding policy, rather it is a fix designed to stop people from gaming a system designed to help legitimate asylum seekers.\n\nThe "tent city" thing comes from the fact that there has recently been a giant wave of people trying to cross the border to make bogus asylum claims. Its getting to the point that there is no longer space in Federal detention centers, and so the government is doing what it does whenever its ability to deal with people is overwhelming - its erecting temporary facilities to house the overflow.\n\nThese facilities aren\'t made out of camping tents, rather they are made out of tents that are designed to support military deployments. If you\'ve ever seen a picture of a US base in Iraq or Afghanistan then you know what the tents look like but generally its like [this](http://alwaght.com/upload/logo/2018318_11/2018318173012116.jpg).\n\nThe reason they use tents like that is because that is simply what the Federal government has on hand to deal with situations like this. You usually see these same tents after major disasters being used to house US citizens until they can find somewhere else as well.'

'As a Puertorican living trough this, Fuck you trump. \n\nFirst he comes here in the fucking presidential plane with all the commodities one could think off and instead of going to most affected area he goes to a rich neighborhood and trows fucking papers towels like its a fucking concert. \n\nOur lives right now consist in planing trips to get water, since theres no running water in our homes. We’re pitch black at night, at the mercy of thieves and people with bad thoughts since theres no electricity or cell phone signal. So if something happens to you though luck. \n\nSo far 10 people have died from drinking river water, its a dam shame that 3.5 million Americans don’t have access to drinking water, let get this straight: Americans are dead because that dint have access to clean drinking water, like in 3rd world countries. This on the American government, they could invade the island in the 1800s, they can invade the fucking Middle East like its nobody’s business but they can’t help fellow Americans get drinking water. \n\nSupermarkets have hour long lines and we you get in its almost empty, theres only rice and canned food. Im not complaining, it’s something to eat, but seeing this orange clown saying he’s going to pull FEMA when theres nearly no food on the supermarkets its hearth breaking. \n\nJust yesterday I caught my neighbors crying because they lost their roof since  Maria, FEMA tarps are nowhere to be seen and what little they had left got wet again, for the 4th time since the hurricane. I had to give them shelter since they had nowhere dry to stay. \n\nTheres still people with no communication with the outside world because of road collapses, this means no access to food, clean water, meds, first aid, doctors, pampers, formula. They’re on their own if FEMA pulls out. \n\nFuck Trump, you’re a disgrace to America, you come here say having 16 dead is something to be proud about, say the budget is out whack and trow paper towel like its a fucking festival and everything is ok, the deed is done. He gave aid! HE GAVE FUCKING PAPER TOWELS SO PACK UP BOYS THE JOB IS DONE! MAGA! \n\nAlso! He dedicated his trophy to us! I feel so good! I might no have drinking water next week but I have a trophy dedication! \n\n\nEdit: Please don’t give gold to this post, research for a NPO and donate to the relief effort instead. \n\nEdit 2: Theres cell service in SOME places, like the PR-30 highway. Im posting from my car in-between calls to banks and other lenders to see how to proceed with payments. \n\nEdit 3: Im heading back home, but before I go theres a few things I would like clear up. \n\n1) Im fine for now, I have bottled water to last for the week and I can still Make the trip to get more at distribution centers, then boil it and treat it with a recommended dose of clorox. Theres people that were less fortunate that I was. Search for nonprofits or organizations that are working with those incommunicated sectors and donate to them. \n\n2) We’re working with the neighbors to restore some of their roof, but most hardware stores in our area are closed or limited on supplies. Who would’ve thought that shipping food and meds to the island is more important than shipping binding materials.\n\n4) Most banks and lenders gave a 3 month stay so we can have a breather, so we got that going for us. \n\n3) If theres some legitimate doubt that im a Puertorican living in the island im more than willing to provide some kind of proof TO THE MODS.\n\nGlad to see this post is getting the word put, almost a month after the Hurricane things are far from normal. A few days ago we where al 25% of the island energized and just yesterday or today 15% of that collapsed so even of some services get restored they’re in a delicate condition.\n\nAgain, things are still hard on the island. Hospital are barely operating, water trips a weakly thing for most of us, lack of real security in the streets as police are busy with other things. Gasoline lines are still a thing, not as bad as the first days after the storm but its still there. \n\nIts hard, theres suffering almost in every corner. The storm affected the whole island, and even those that were mostly prepared like me dint expect this leven of devastation. The whole island stopped for more than a week and now its trying to start back again. \n\nThanks for the messages and the support, its comforting to know most Americans still stand with us. I just ask that you don’t forget about us, it will take years to rebuild the damage done by Maria. '

If his lawyer had Trump's authority to execute the agreement, then all Trump has to do is acknowledge and adopt the contract, and it is 100% binding.\n\nStormy Daniels' lawyer knows this. But they also know that politically Trump cannot acknowledge or adopt this contract. This is win-win-win for them. Either (1) Trump refuses to adopt the contract, in which case she gets out of it and gets to sell her story to the networks, (2) Trump adopts the contract, and that in itself is a news story, or (3) she gets more money from Trump to drop the suit.\n\nEdit: A few people are correctly pointing out that another issue for Trump is that asserting the contract was for his benefit may also have implications for an FEC violation."

'Republican memo goes to FBI and department of justice. They object to it\'s release on grounds of the sensitive nature of materials. The white house says fuck it, release it.\n\nDemocractic memo goes to FBI and department of justice. They object to it\'s release on grounds of the sensitive nature of materials. The white house says "oh well, snap, we gotta ensure we are not releasing any sensitive materials"'
'Not surprising. In fact an article came out earlier today that said he was releasing it later today, but given his track record of last minute pull-backs, it’s pretty predictable at this point. His game plan is to pretend he’ll do something, put that out there in the press, and then undo it. What a stable genius. '
"So, FBI asks Nunes not to release their memo, they do it anyway.\n\nFBI says the countermemo is a-okay, they deny it.\n\nHow is this acceptable? The corruption in the executive branch is absolutely rank.\n\nSo it's pretty safe to assume that the countermemo completely invalidates any shred of credibility Nunes or Trump may have had on the matter and quite possibly humiliates them in the process. Not releasing it is their attempt at a cover up. The most bold-faced cover up in the history of cover ups.\n\nKeeping the truth under wraps doesn't change the truth one bit."

'Important part I feel like many are not talking about \n\n> The White House included a letter **signed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray** that says they have identified portions of the Democratic memo that would raise national security or law enforcement concerns if released publicly. '
'Does this really surprise anyone?\n\nDonald Trump is a Russian asset and a traitor. He’s not going to do anything that goes against his own interest or Russia’s. Releasing the memo would only justify the FBIs investigation against him and his team of traitors. \n\nPeople shouldn’t have expected anything else from him. \n\nAt least now it’s obvious to the world.

Oh yeah we’re suddenly careful about handling classified intel. *COUGH* Israeli Intel  *COUGH* ISIL and laptops *COUGH*\n\nFucking trash."

We could all mail our favorite books to:  \nDonald Trump   \n1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW  \nWashington, DC 20006  \nI think that sends the right positive message of what we want for our future.

I'm not knocking the West Palm Beach fire department, but let's be honest: the only reason the president is giving speeches to them is because they live near his vacation home, and because they agreed to be there. _Maybe_ every president gives little micro speeches to whoever happens to be around at the time...?"

'I get that it\'s a funny headline, but articles like this just feel like pandering to get an emotional reaction, sowing discontent while they attempt to go viral and generate clicks.\n\nTrump has a special personal hate on for Obama, but every president actively uses his first term to undo his predecessors actions, and with good reason. America swings like a pendulum from left to right then back again, and seems to swing farther left and right as time goes on. It elects a politician on a platform based on the discontent of it\'s citizens with the incumbent and his policies, the winner having a mandate which boils down to "Be the opposite of the last guy, and take a few more liberties to punish his party for treating us badly."\n\nObama lead an administration far away from the ideals that Bush embodied. Bush lead an administration far away from the ideals of Clinton. Clinton away from Bush. Reagan away from Carter.\n\nIt just feels like we\'d be far better off focusing on the tangible horrible things this administration is doing, rather than wasting emotion of stuff like this, especially when every president is guilty of it.'

There is a different standard of proof in a Civil Lawsuit.  Things do not have to be proved "beyond a reasonable doubt", but rather to a "preponderance of the evidence".  That\'s "more likely than not" as a standard, that means that an act which is carefully concealed, but to which circumstances point, may sometimes be presumed to be true.  Don\'t like that?  That\'s how it is in this country, that\'s how it works.\n\nIf the suit is allowed to proceed there will be a discovery phase, and during discovery people can be subpoenaed and deposed - they have reduced or no 5th amendment protection, with the penalty for just saying "nah, I won\'t talk" being potential default judgement against that party.\n\nThis is a very serious thing - this is part of how Nixon was brought down.  The President cannot pardon his way out of this, in fact with this suit in place a pardon of a party or witness will remove their ability to refuse to testify by invoking the 5th amendment because accepting a pardon admits guilt.\n\nAnd this would go before a jury - probably a Washington DC jury, who could decide this any way they like, facts presented or not.\n\nAnyway as I said, this is very serious, this is why you see so much noise in here, the smoke is being poured in a great rate.  \n'

There are lots of things with Uranium in them that don\'t and won\'t blow up.\n\n* The Uranium was sold to US subsidiaries of Russian companies.  It\'s all still in the US and it\'s not going to go anywhere, they just get to use it.\n\n* The supposed payoffs don\'t make sense.  The donations mostly come from one guy who left the company over a year before Hillary, who couldn\'t have done anything anyway, became SoS and 3-4 years before the deal was on the table.\n\nI can\'t wait to see how many of you this triggers.\n\n'

He can't be seen directly with Trump, but would possibly still be in contact. (If you saw that [PBS special on Bannon,](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/bannons-war/) you know he kept physical distance for much of Trump's campaign, but advised him throughout.) \n\nPBS had a segment the other day regarding Bannon's comments to a liberal magazine, whose TLDR was best put as: Take it all with a HUGE amount of salt.

He’ll now be employed by the Mercers to promote the agenda outside of government, while coordinating with the Whitehouse.    They’re realizing that he is more effective outside the institutional constraints of the public sector.  And this makes Trump look like he’s paying some sort of penitence for the Charlottesville debacle.  It’s a win-win for this administration.  No one should be deluded into thinking this is some sort of victory for those that oppose it.'

"What a tough choice for Flynn. On one hand you have a guy who's demonstrated over and over again that he's only loyal to himself, and on the other you've got your own son..."
"If he is cooperating, this is more interesting (IMO) than cooperation by Manafort. Because Flynn was actually a part of the Trump Administration, he knows who knows about any criminal acts (i.e. Pence) whereas DJ Pauly M would only know the binary did collusion occur/did collusion not occur. \n\nOut of all of this, I'm still the most interested in what Pence knows/how he found out. Out of all the players in this, Pence entered with zero motivation to work with the Russians - no financial or urination-based ties. So, if collusion actually occurred, how did Trump convince Pence to be complicit in it? Remember when Trump was reported having second thoughts about having Pence on the ticket with him? Was Pence pushing back on this? Why did that stop?"
'Happy Flipsgiving!'
'A Happy Mueller Thanksgiving!'
">  Lawyers for Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser, notified the president’s legal team in recent days that they could no longer discuss the special counsel’s investigation, \n\n> The notification alone does not prove that Mr. Flynn is cooperating with Mr. Mueller. Some lawyers withdraw from information-sharing arrangements as soon as they begin negotiating with prosecutors. And such negotiations sometimes fall apart.\n\n> Still, the notification led Mr. Trump’s lawyers to believe that Mr. Flynn — who, along with his son, is seen as having significant criminal exposure — has, at the least, begun discussions with Mr. Mueller about cooperating.\n\n-\n\n> Mr. Flynn is regarded as loyal to Mr. Trump, but he has in recent weeks expressed serious concerns to friends that prosecutors will bring charges against his son, Michael Flynn Jr., who served as his father’s chief of staff and was a part of several financial deals involving the elder Mr. Flynn that Mr. Mueller is scrutinizing.\n\nThis is not the news the Trump clan was hoping for this Thankgiving.  Especially Kushner.  I'm thankful that the backchannel proposition is still a major focus:\n\n> Among the interactions that Mr. Mueller is investigating is a private meeting that Mr. Flynn had with the Russian ambassador and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, during the presidential transition. In the past year, it has been revealed that the Trump campaign repeatedly tried to meet with Russian officials who were promising compromising information on Mrs. Clinton.\n"

'> Defense lawyers frequently share information during investigations, but they must stop when doing so would pose a conflict of interest.

This is seriously sad.\n\n*Edit 3: Just harping on the fact that people had a problem with his statement on Charlottesville being "late" when he can\'t address the fact that he is so quick to make a statement when violence might involve Islam.\n\n*Edit 4: All is capitalized times five? So he had ALL ALL ALL ALL ALL written on his paper so that he wouldn\'t forget to say it? Since he doesn\'t actually believe it on his own?\n\n*Edit 5: Jobs! Says the unemployment rate is at its lowest in 17 years. So it was really low after Clinton\'s presidency and after Obama\'s? Can he not see that?\n\n*Edit 6: Your supporters are literally Nazis. But you know, can\'t attack their decency.\n\n*Edit 7: I\'m watching CNN and he\'s basically saying CNN is cutting the feed because they don\'t want their viewers to see his message. But obviously they haven\'t cut the fucking feed.\n\n*Edit 8: What a self obsessed moron.\n\n*Edit 9: OMG he\'s actually going to do it. He\'s going to pardon Joe. What a fuckwad.\n\n*Edit 10: All Mexicans are MS-13. Is that what he just implied?\n\n*Edit 11: If we have to close down our government to build the wall, we\'re going to do it. How will that work Trump? Don\'t you kind of need the government to build the wall in your fantasy? Also, pretty sure Heroin comes into the ports on the east coast, not across the Mexican border. And we\'re in a opioid/heroin epidemic, not a cocaine/marijuana epidemic.\n\n*Edit 12: I guess he didn\'t get the memo that Mitch doesn\'t like him anymore.\n\n*Edit 13: One vote. So fucking whiny.\n\n*Edit 14: "Every day we are keeping our promises..." sure bud.\n\n*Edit 15: "Something happened. Something bad happened. Check it out." Sure glad he had all the facts there.\n\n*Edit 16: I can\'t even make sense of the word vomit he just had on Afghanistan. If someone has any insight on it, I\'d love to hear it.\n\n*Edit 17: If I\'m not mistaken at the start of this CNN reported that neither the governor, mayor, nor the two senators from AZ were in attendance. Now Trump is saying the governor came. Which one is it?\n\n*Edit 18: He is draining the swamp. But the swamp he created. Why are his supporters so blind?\n\n*Edit 19: He started off tonight complaining about how he can\'t get anything done because of the Senate and democrats. Now he\'s saying that he\'s accomplished more than any other president in his first 7 months.\n\n*Edit 20: And now he\'s bragging about his stolen Supreme Court appointee.\n\n*Edit 21: "Beautiful, clean coal." [Wat](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/173/576/Wat8.jpg?1315930535)\n\n*Edit 22: No one is going to argue in favor of taking down George Washington\'s statues. What an idiot.\n\n*Edit 23: "The stock market is at its highest point in history." Didn\'t it go down over the last week? So that would mean it was higher a week ago. And that would mean that it isn\'t currently at its highest point. Unless it bounced back.\n\n*Edit 24: I love how he\'s painting a picture of the proposed tax cut like it\'s going straight into these poor people\'s pockets. So many lies.\n\n*Edit 25: It is now over. I think I figured it out, Trump thinks he is America. It\'s the only way his comments makes sense. Thanks for reading my thoughts on this as it happened.\n\n*Edit 26 : Don Lemon killed it with his synopsis. "Well, what do you say to that? I\'m just going to speak from the heart here. What we have witnessed was a total eclipse of the facts. Someone who came out onstage and lied directly to the American people, and left things out that he said, in an attempt to rewrite history. Especially when it comes to Charlottesville. He\'s unhinged, it\'s embarrassing, and I don\'t mean for us the media because he went after us, but for the country. This is who we elected President of the United States. A man who is so petty that he has to go after people who he deems to be his enemy, like an imaginary friend of a six year old. His speech was without thought, it was without reason, it was devoid of facts, it was devoid of wisdom, there was no gravitas, there was no sanity there. He was like a child blaming a sibling...A man clearly wounded by the rational people who are abandoning him in droves..."\n\n*EDIT: Thanks so much for the gold kind stranger!

"Mr. President you dropped this:\n\n>on both sides. On both sides.  Not Donald Trump.  Not Barack Obama. It's been going on for a long, long time.\n\nIt's funny you didn't cite that part of the speech in your declaration about how dishonest the media is.  The funny thing is, I'm still convinced you ad-libbed the 'on both sides' portion of your speech!"
"Btw it seems like Trump is pushing for the wall again, which is absolutely hilarious in light of his relationship with McConnell, who has received zero help from Trump in trying to pass Obamacare repeal. McConnell now not only can't pass legislation he and the GOP wants to pass, he has Trump breathing down his neck over a ridiculous fucking wall. The GOP is on its way to completely imploding. "
"WARNING! Whatever you do, do NOT watch Trump's speech! Nothing to see there anyway, just tune in to CNN and let them tell you about it. The best way to find out what Trump said in his speech is to listen in to CNN. Stay safe!"
"As I was watching this I had a realization. Trump speaks like he's a four year old telling a story at the dinner table. \n\nI talked to Billy and Billy said that I took his Power Ranger, but I didn't take his Power Ranger so then I talked to Billy's Mom, and she took his side, it was so unfair. So then I though I would tell Billy that I would tell my dad about him not telling about me and his Power Ranger the right way. My dad can beat up anyone. You know that right? He's like super strong, super strong. Anyone. That was when Billy's mom said I had to go home... I don't think I like Billy so much anymore. He's a liar. I'll tell you one thing, I'm keeping that Power Ranger!"
'Seemed more like a WWE smackdown talk than a presidential speech. I liked the bit 20 minutes in when he\'s like "Oh, they\'re turning the cameras off! They\'re turning the cameras off!" And nothing happened, the camera didn\'t move or stop. He was forced to get back into his rambling.\n\nAt one point I thought it was going to turn into a hostage situation when the president said "Everyone, is safe inside here..." or something along those lines. He said it a few times, I was getting nervous for the people in that crowd. \n\n'

They’re convinced that anything critical of him is a MSM/Deep State conspiracy (even when it’s his own words). \n\nTo them, supporting their guy and triggering libruls is more important than common sense and the endless stream of contradictions spilling out of Trump’s mouth.'
'She just doesn\'t understand the 4D chess he\'s playing. Of course he had to make overblown promises in order to get elected and then deliver lesser but still tangible "improvements." (/s)\n\nInteresting...that\'s a big part of what "the Establishment" does that puts his supporters off so much.'
'He doesn\'t care. His supporters don\'t care. Pointing out contradictions in your opponent\'s arguments only works if they have a shred of intellectual honesty and are arguing in good faith.\n\nThat does not apply to the guy who spent three years "investigating" the sitting president\'s birth certificate. Or the guy who wanted men punished for a crime they didn\'t commit. Or the guy who decided to pretend to be a man of the people while having a higher net worth than the sixty million people who voted for him combined.'

'>A wide majority of Republicans surveyed, 84 percent, said that Trump is fit for office.\n\nThis is a good example of why Republicans get called "stupid" all the time.'
'The fact that over 4 / 5 of Republicans think he\'s fit for the presidency shows that American politics isn\'t about policy or anything, it\'s just about being the "winners". I don\'t think voting republican, or being conservative, is strange, but thinking Trump is a good president is an insult to humanity. How easily are you won over by obvious demagoguery? Read a book. '
'Interesting that 37% of Hispanics view trump favorably, while 43% of white view him favorably. Throughout the survey Hispanics only trail whites by ~5% in favorable views of Trump. \n\nThis quite a shock to me. Democrats can no longer rely in the Hispanic vote. '
'Look, having nuclear — my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart — you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I’m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world — it’s true! — but when you’re a conservative Republican they try — oh, do they do a number — that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune — you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged — but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me — it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are — nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what’s going to happen and he was right, who would have thought? — but when you look at what’s going on with the four prisoners — now it used to be three, now it’s four — but when it was three and even now, I would have said it’s all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don’t, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years — but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us.\n\n--- Donald Trump.'

Anyone with money could have done the same thing. Worthless, stupid clown of a President."
'Here\'s the thing: I don\'t care what he weighs. If he were a great man, we would adore him regardless of his weight.

"Why doesn't Trump use the wide array of DoD owned golf courses? The US military currently operates almost 200 golf courses, almost 3,000 holes, all around the world, to include Guantanamo Bay, Europe, and even a couple holes in the Middle East. There is also the “World’s Most Dangerous Golf Course“, a single par 3 just below the DMZ in Korea. Most notably, a 54-hole championship course is right outside DC at Andrews AFB. Most are on secure bases and blocked off from the general public. He could even land on the military airfields and avoid any protesters or demonstrations. Military courses are also operated by MWR and MCCS, which means the proceeds go right back into the military community and benefits programs for the troops and creates jobs for military spouses. He could even play with lower ranking officers and enlisted troops in order to pick their brains on their experiences in a relaxed, somewhat informal setting. This would be a valuable opportunity as Commander-in-Chief to gain first hand accounts of the challenges our military faces. It would also be an easy PR victory and something that would be hard for his critics to attack.\n\n"

I care that he and his supporters blasted Obama for doing the same (though to a much lesser degree than Trump!), and that he stood in front of thousands of Americans saying he would NOT do this, and now blatantly DOES it. '
'**Let me just leave this here**\n\n>President Obama has spent **all or part of 26 days "on vacation" during his first year as president,** according to CBS News White House Correspondent Mark Knoller.\n\n>Knoller, who has covered every president since Gerald Ford and is known for keeping detailed records on presidential travel, counts the following among President Obama’s "vacations" in 2009:\n\n* A four-day holiday weekend in Chicago in February where the president played some basketball and treated First Lady Michelle Obama to a Valentine’s Day dinner date.\n* An eight-day stay with his family at a rented house on Martha’s Vineyard in August.\n* A trip out west to the U.S. states of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Arizona that combined both business and pleasure. The president held town hall meetings on health care during the trip. And he went fly fishing and took trips to Yellowstone National Park and the Grand Canyon with his wife and two daughters.\n* An 11-day stay in Hawaii where the president and his family celebrated Christmas and New Year’s Eve.\n\n\nhttp://www.factcheck.org/2010/01/president-obamas-vacation-days/\n\nEDIT: Just to clarify, I am trying to show how few days Obama took compared to Trump, especially with how Trump whined and bitched about Obama\'s vacations.'
"I just spit out my soda when I saw the headline. \n\nOn to the article itself.\n\n> The trip could partially be related to the fact that the government is replacing the heating and cooling system in the White House's West Wing, so everyone who works there will need to leave by the end of the week, according to the AP.\n\nOk, so a lot of the staff needs to be away. Fine. Don't any of them have any other offices? Aren't there any other places where Trump can work?\n\n> The Senate is currently scheduled to be in Washington through the end of next week, after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced they would delay the summer break to try catch up on a backlog of nominations and legislation. \n\nAren't there over 100 positions for whom Trump needs to nominate someone? \n\nAnd this trip is ~~a week~~ **two** and a **half** weeks long. And I fully expect Trump to try to take another day or two to unwind from his vacation, to get readjusted to the White House. You know, just take time to relax after all the time he spent golfing, tweeting, watching commercials and old episodes of The Apprentice, having fun with a coloring book with the only option being the 2016 electoral map, and eating chocolate cake. "
'Input the old truth that the further the mango is from anything substantive, the better.  \n  \n'
"Well he's done such a good job making America great again that he really deserves a nice two and a half week vacation. I mean, healthcare is fixed, ISIS is destroyed, Chicago is safe again, Hillary is in prison, Russia is our friend again, China has stopped being aggressive in the south pacific, North Korea is disarmed..."
"the sad thing is that while Hillary probably wanted the title of first woman president I think she mainly wanted the job. She has the reputation of being a policy wonk and I think it drives her to figure out budgets, diplomatic discussions, military strategies. Trump just wanted the title, he doesn't want to work. He's not about the nitty gritty details just let him sign a bill that everyone else worked out and go play golf to reward himself while the news reports praise his awesome legislative accomplishments. It really is sad to see that we elected such immature ideals to the highest office this world has to offer. "
'I have no problem with any president taking a vacation. I also don\'t care that he\'s a hypocrite. However, I do care that Trump\'s supporters will stay silent on this, but talked all the time about whatever Obama is doing. That shows weakness on the part of Trump\'s supporters, that instead of looking outside of party at what\'s best for the country in all matters, they instead choose teams like this is sports. It\'s shameful, and it\'s far from whatever the definition is of what it means to be an "American". Perhaps the people who have the most American flag stickers and the most red, white and blue products and the most pickup trucks and the most patriotic playlists... perhaps they should apply love of honesty and country to their lives, and not just display it as a facade.'
'>That suggests that the committee ended the inauguration with tens of millions of dollars of cash on hand.

Let's see, there is a handful of people running this 501(c)(4) nonprofit inauguration committee: Tom Barrack, Rick Gates, Lloyd Claycomb and Alex Stroman.  These are all good friends of Donald Trump of course.  Let's see, seventy-five thousand dollars divided by four people equals a cool $18,750 apiece every month.

"You can't say that he's incapable of duty because you disagree with him and then expect that to become reality. That's not how the world works. You need to actually demonstrate he's incapable of duty. You need more evidence to support the argument. Calling for it prematurely to this will only serve to further complicate executing on the matter when the appropriate evidence is available.\n\nI understand many of you have strong desires to see Trump impeached. If you want to accomplish this goal, the path to doing so requires strategic timing and execution around certain variables. You cannot simply pursue every whim as an opportunity as though it has no consequence upon failing. You must act with strategy and decisiveness.\n\nMy personal belief is that at this point in time the government cannot change anything with any degree of reliability. Beyond the fear mongering and malice, there exists only deadlock. Deadlock means we're in the state Obama left things, more or less, and that's about as good as it can get. In my mind, all of you rooting to impeach Trump and empower Pence to start changing things are wildly misguided and beholden only to some petty ends without any concept of the consequences of cultivating what appears to be justice.\n\nWe aren't living in a comic book, the good guy doesn't always win and justice being done doesn't necessarily mean a happy ending. We CAN make mathematical evaluations of probable outcomes applying Game Theory and the reality is that bad things happen to good people in this situation. Worse things happen to good people if we chase partisan politics down a rabbit hole. Even worse things await us leading a revolution trying to right the wrongs of that.\n\nYou can't just change or reshape society on a whim because it feels good. You have to consider the implications of the event and whom you empower by doing it. You have to consider what happens if suddenly you reduce the opposition to the leadership in power to serve the justice you believe you deserve. I know that it isn't easy to do so, but I implore that you try before you wish upon a genie awaiting with baited breath to bequeath bedlam on all of us.\n\nYou can and are stopping Trump. You won't have the same power to stop Pence. Please, consider realistically what happens when that is the reality and stop chasing blindly an ideal of justice that might condemn us."
"Unfortunately, the Cabinet members who are needed to invoke 25 have no interest in doing so because they benefit from the current state of things.\n\nAnd given the current makeup of the House, it doesn't matter what Mueller digs up, they're going to be as willing to impeach as they were to have confirmation hearings on Obama's supreme court nomination."

'What I\'m confused about is the translation in general. Putin actually says, "Yes, I wanted him to win" not "Yes I did, Yes I did." I don\'t understand why everyone is reporting the wrong language. I feel that this is important because Putin appears to be answering the first part of the question, "Did you want him to win" and not "did you direct your officials..." When I listened to it live I thought that was an important distinction because obviously Putin wanted Trump to win over HRC but isn\'t directing officials to help much more egregious? It seems weird to me to remove Yes I wanted him to win but to leave allow the second part.\n\n  \nCan anyone explain this to me?\n\nRegardless this is incredible and I honestly can\'t believe it.

'Lordy, there were tapes? This should be so easy to clear up then. Surely the president would want to clear this up and prove Dick Durbin wrong.\n\nI think we know the answer, though. The president said what has been reported. Then he lied about it and said he\'s the "the least racist person" the reporter had ever interviewed (no, really, [he said those words](http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/14/politics/donald-trump-racist/index.html)). That might actually be true... if the reporter has spent his entire career interviewing literal Nazis.'
'Cotton and Perdue both said they did not recall at all the president calling places "shitholes." Following the release of the WSJ interview recording taken by the White House, they have changed their story again:\n\nThis time saying "Well, he said \'shithouse.\'\n\nThis correction changes nothing about the meaning of what was said. It\'s pretty obvious they changed their tune once they realized there were potentially recordings of it.\n\nI am not sure if it was Trump or Sanders that thought it was a good idea to play their hand and show they had their own recordings, but wow did they not think that through.'
'Yes please. '
'Does anyone really believe that if there were tapes, the White House would provide them unaltered? They are so far above the law that they could literally replace Trump\'s voice with Siri saying "I\'m like, the greatest fan of Haiti and Africa. The best. They love me. And I love them. Those countries are not shitholes. Believe me. Not. They are not — and I want to make this clear — I do not think they are shitholes like Senator Durbin over there just said about the good people of those countries during this White House meeting we are currently in." And every media outlet and every Republican would call for Durbin to be arrested for slander.\n\nWe live in an upside down world where Trump can divest from his business dealings by bringing stacks of blank paper to a press conference and everyone goes, "Nice work, we totally believe you. Now go do absolutely anything you want to make money for yourself using the office of the presidency."'
'"He didn\'t say shitholes. He said pitbulls! Why are we letting people in from pitbull countries?!?!  The recording is clear as day!  What else does Master Trump want me to hear?"'
'I like Trump cause he tawlks like me.'

'I asked a friend two days ago if George Will has left the Republican party. Seems I can predict the future.\n\nMaybe I should ask him tomorrow if Trump got hit by a bus'
">George Will, a longtime political commentator and staunch defender of the conservative movement, made a dramatic exit from the Republican Party Friday, citing the party’s support for Donald Trump in the upcoming 2020 presidential election.\n\nSo it took Will incarcerating children to get him to leave the Trump party. That's his bar.\n\nMost rational people fled a long time ago."
'Uh FYI guys, George Will departed the Republican party two years ago....\n\n[http://www.politifact.com/texas/article/2016/jul/07/george-will-dropped-republican-voter-registration-/](http://www.politifact.com/texas/article/2016/jul/07/george-will-dropped-republican-voter-registration-/)'
"I'll be honest, here. When I read George Will's column earlier today, I was flabbergasted. I couldn't have been more surprised if the ghost of Ronald Reagan had appeared in front of me to slap a random Republican for supporting Trump.\n\nAs a seismic shift, this probably won't affect most of Trump's core constituents, since I doubt many of them have even heard of George Will, much less read one of his columns. But in the older demographic, and the real conservasphere, this has to be echoing like the Trump of Doom."
'There’s never been any doubt that George Will is a smart man. I didn’t realize how strong he is, too.\n\nLadies and gentleman, this is what a patriot looks and sounds like.\n\nIf all Republicans were like Will and Rick Wilson, we’d have a much more healthy state of governance.'
'I am glad to see the old guard conservatives beginning to publicly disavow and condemn the vile cult the Republican Party has become. They see that they must stand by freedom and rule of law above all else. In my lifetime I never, ever thought I’d say these words: Kudos to you George Will.'
"I've been reading George Will for decades, and while we rarely agreed politically, I always thought he was a talented and articulate writer. His main flaw in my book has been his staunch conservative views. \n\nBut, if you had told me 10 or 20 years ago that one day Will would be encouraging people to vote *against the Republican president*, I would have thought you were loony.\n\n"
'I must say, I\'ve always thought, all these years, that so many conservatives--even those who built elaborate intellectual constructions defending various "core conservative issues" like tax breaks or states\' rights--were really (deep down) authoritarian racists....  That they were people who were driven as much by despising the (liberal) "enemy within" as by what they actually wanted in government. \n\n...because the Republican party was just so *good* at those dog-whistles.  Those Willi-Horton ads, those invocations of compromise as "weakness", those attacks on Democrats as not just wrong but as "un-American."  They turned to them again and again, and got better and better at it.  \n\nBut now--now that the Republican party has gone from racist "dog-whistles" to full-blown wannabe-Nazism--I can see that I was both right and wrong. \n\nRight, in that a good chunk of Republicans, especially voters, are totally fine with full-blown racist authoritarianism.  And so many Republican politicians have "gone over" to Trumpism, after some hand-wringing and waffling, sure, still... they\'ve done it.  They\'ve been willing to embrace a racist, authoritarian demagogue who wants to take a piss on the Constitution of the United States because doing so will make "liberals" feel bad.\n\nBut I was also wrong, in that a few leading lights have surprised me. \n\nWith George Will, I was wrong.   He is what he said he is:  a true conservative.  *Not* a closet racist, not a secret authoritarian.  Not a hater. \n\nGeorge (if I may):  I apologize.  I thought the worst of you, but you have proven me wrong.  \n\nI hope you find a party you can believe in again. '
'>Corey Lewandowski, a Trump campaign official who fell from the king’s grace but is crawling back (he works for Vice President Pence’s political action committee), [recently responded on Fox News](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/06/20/womp-womp-outrage-after-corey-lewandowski-mocks-story-of-child-with-down-syndrome-separated-from-parents/?utm_term=.8a0cf3a6235a) to the story of a 10-year-old girl with Down syndrome taken from her parents at the border. Lewandowski replied: “Wah, wah.” Meaningless noise is this administration’s appropriate libretto because, just as a magnet attracts iron filings, Trump attracts, and is attracted to, louts.\n\n\\- George Will'
'In high school and college, in no small part to his baseball ties (Men at Work is still one of my favorite books), George Will was my political lodestone. He was well-spoken (if not a bit pompous), logical, and explained his positions with facts and history. I think I have read at least three of his books. \n\nI remember being impressed, in the depth of the flag burning amendment pressure (1996?) that he asked, “are we all waist deep in the smoke of burning flags? Amendments are important and this isn’t a real issue.”  \n\nIt makes me happy that this symbolic (if not also a curmudgeon) political figure has also given up on the party I have abandoned to the point of (paraphrasing) “If we have to lose, we deal with it, it is better than four more years of what we have”.'
'I\'m so happy that "Conservatives" are truly beginning to understand that "Republicans" do not represent them. Just like "Progressives" don\'t represent "Democrats," and vice-versa. \n\nThose labels are so simple. '
"I often found myself disagreeing with George Will on several issues, but always respected his opinions based upon his analysis & understanding of the issues. Especially in the days and years prior to when Newsweek became pure garbage.\n\nThis is one of those times. \n\nTrump doesn't deserve the slightest respect. George Will's judgement of Trump reflects that. This is one of those times where I agree whole heartedly with Will's judgement.\n\nSad to say that the Democratic party is the beneficiary of this, as they havn't done anything to deserve the credit for this."
'I remember a time when you could barely tell the party affiliations of political pundits. George Will was always sensible, even if I didn’t agree with him. '
"It's so weird to me that it's taken 2 years for these people to figure out that Trump is scamming them. How Deeply do you have to be invested in your political party to endorse and consistently support a candidate who rejects pretty much all of your parties foundational beliefs"
'I got the chance to spend a lot of time with George Will during the 2012 republican national convention. I was in college and I got a job as a runner with ABC news, but I got assigned to essentially be his personal assistant for the weekend.\n\nAt the time I didn’t even know who he was. But from my interaction with him he was a really nice guy. He even signed a copy of his book and mailed it to me after the weekend to thank me for helping him out. '
"One interesting aspect of this has been watching the litmus test for some of these people come about. How far is too far for each of these folks?\n\nRob the public coffers? Sure, I mean that's why we're here right?\n\nDestroy social safety nets for the poorest americans? Lifelong dream...\n\nIgnore the Constitution and profit from the office of the Presidency? Well, yeah....\n\nArresting illegal immigrants and put their children in cages? Well, ok this is where I get off....\n\nIt'll be very telling to see how far the rest of them are willing to go. "
"This is huge. He was very possibly the smartest man in the Republican Party. He's the one you could point to and say that Republicans aren't dumb. Yeah, now you're all pretty much dumb as shit."
'Lol did people look at the sources? He left the party in 2016. '
"> “This is not my party,” Will said the speech, noting that while it’s a little too late to find a replacement for him on the ticket, conservatives can “grit their teeth for four years” after making sure that Trump loses.\n\nFour years? You think the GOP will suddenly become respectable again? Put them back in in four years and it's right back to concentration camps."
'I am sure Judge Curiel is an honorable and professional man, but I can\'t help but point and laugh at Trump... "I am building a wall, he has an inherent conflict of interest, okay", he said.\n\nKarma being a bitch in the Trump context is very funny.\n\n'
'ITT:  Suddenly Trump supporters care about conflict of interest and potential bias.'
'Sweet sweet poetic Karma'
'This is what sweet, sweet Karma looks like, honestly.\n\nCue the Republicans shouting "Bias!" from the rooftops any moment now and demanding his recusal. '
'The number of ACTUAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST Trump deliberately creates for his own benefit dwarf the phoney conflicts of interest he and his supporters will cry about.'
'This kind of thing makes me reconsider the existence of some supreme power planning out everything...and that they are a fucking troll.  I love it.'
'Republicans: “how can a Mexican-American possibly be trusted to have both the interests of Mexico and America in mind?!!?!!?!!?!?”'
'I love this country. '
'Oh god this is just beautiful. God bless america!'
'This entire administration seems like one long episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm. '
'i love it'
'I love Mexico.'
"Mexico did this regardless of what Trump said and did. Why is Newsweek trying to discredit what Mexico is doing?\n\nThey make it sound like the only reason Mexico is giving aid is because they don't like Trump. "
"I would love to see the look on Trump's face when he sees the humanitarian aid package arriving from North Korea. "
"But... but he said big water, ocean water. Didn't that mean it was super hard? Was he... lying?"
'Lol slaps TRUMP in the face. Cool clickbait. Was Mexico sends aid to pr just not enough? '
'They rescinded their aid to Texas, pretty sure they will do it again.'
"How is this a slap in the face? Another country ended up footing the bill thus saving the American taxpayer a few pennies. This is great news for American's."
"Is this a TMZ title? Also, the title makes it sound like Trump hasn't given any kind of relief when infact its the COMPLETE opposite,"
"I didn't vote for Trump in nor do I support him but you guys act like he has not sent any Aid. FEMA and the military are down there. Why is everybody acting like he hasn't sent anybody?"
'Mexico should ship aid direct to PR **even after the Jones Act waiver expires**.  What is the US Navy going to do?  Sink the Mexican ships?  With the whole world watching.  While they save PR US citizens?   Get the popcorn out!'
"Trust that it's not a slap in the face. The only reason people are having trouble getting supplies is because of the local teamsters union in Puerto Rico. Even if the Mexican supplies got there safely they would sit in a lot because the teamsters are basically acting like gangsters."
"It is not a slap, i disagree with the headline's interpretation, it is some of our neighbors, allies and friends helping us give the area all the help it can get after such a divasting blow.\n\nCertainly we should welcome mexico's help, especially after they were also victim of brutal earthquakes too that caused a number of casualties in their own country and damaged even their capital.\n\nSo, thank you mexicans :)"
"I'm just happy people are helping people in need.. The way it should be "
"The U.S. just helped us after the earthquake, so we are offering our help like many times in the past... This isn't about Trump, we are very grateful you helped us so we will help you, you are neighbors, thats what we do when disasters strike.\n\nAlso we sent our condolences and our president called Trump after the Vegas attack, we are in good terms with you and your current administration, hate to see media trying to politicize a good action. "
'I hope Mexico slaps me in the face by giving me money.'
"How appropriate! They did it on National Taco day! LOL I'm sure they had no clue, but that's hilarious. We owe a huge thanks to Mexico, and a giant fuck you to the Orange shithead."
"I just asked the biggest Trump supporter where I work how he feels about this and he said its a good thing because he's showing that he wants to help immigrants. He also said Trump told Congress to do a daca deal because he wants it done by the books so nobody gives him shit about it and that both the dems and republicans are dragging their feet but Trump is doing a great job. The mental gymnastics are amazing. "
'"Hire American! Hire American! What?? Me?? If Hillary and Obama hadn\'t put in the laws that made it so easy to hire cheaper foreign workers i wouldn\'t! Sad!"\n'
"America First!  I love sending articles like this to my family (Trump supporters).  For all that talk about JOBS JOBS JOBS and here's a chance for Trump himself to employ Americans and he's like NOPE, I'll go with the cheapest labor possible please, FUCK AMERICANS!!"
"So not only did he hire 141 foreign workers, he also passed legislation for more of the types of visas that would allow him to hire those workers? I wish more trump supporters would see things like this. They trust his words more than his actions and his actions show who he's really working for. Himself and the ultra wealthy like him. "
'As is amply clear by looking at his administration, honest, decent Americans are unwilling to work for Trump.'
"Wait a minute, so what you're telling me is none of those unemployed factory workers from the rust belt who voted for Trump applied for these great jobs?  Unpossible."
'President hypocrite folks. All you redcaps remember you aren’t good enough to work for the president’s businesses. H1B first.  Immigrants will do a better job for less money according to the president. He’s encouraging other businesses to do the same and give away American jobs in the name of bigger profits. '
'Yea - dude loves making America great again, by simultaneously hating immigrants, and relying on them for labor.'
'Wut we love immigrants now. \n\n-trump supporters'
'See guys! He loves immigrants!! /s '
"Well duh, he's not involved in his businesses because he's busy being the president. If he was running them I'm sure he'd make sure only to hire Americans /s"
'I love how Trump\'s businesses operate the exact way he says the current economy and immigration system causes businesses to act and people STILL come on her like "oh wow we really fuckin\' found something guise."\n\nYou know what would be a hit to his credibility? Show me some evidence his businesses are using dumbass business practices out of some misguided opinion of the greater good. '
'So did 143 go to legal immigrants?'

"If you're going to work at The White House make sure you wear something that looks good under a bus."
"As a non American, During Obama's presidency , I heard a mix of news. Most uplifting, some critical of Obama. News that called into question Obama's character was extremely rare. There were quite a lot of accomplishments that the Obama govt. achieved. Obama was rarely on the front page, and when he was, mostly because of positive things.\n \nIts been 193 days, I have yet to hear a single thing that Trump has done successfully. He is always on the front page, and always in a negative light. \nEvery day there is news of some fuckup from him or his administration.  \n\nIs there anything that the Trump govt. has done since they came to power. Is there progress  on even a single campaign promise he made? "
'Trump has _just_ tweeted "A great day at the White House" \n\nThis is hilarious'
'I don\'t even have a kid yet, but in high school when he or she is in a government class and he or she asks me about this administration, I\'m going to open the fridge, pull out a 6 pack, and say "well I guess you\'re about ready to have a few beers with your old man. This is gonna be a long night but I\'m gonna give it to you straight."\n\nOn second thought might make it a 12 pack or a 5th of jack.'

The fact that @realDonaldTrump won’t stand up for an American patriot is a travesty\n\nFrom FBI Director Wray via [Jim Sciutto](https://twitter.com/jimsciutto/status/1019730554323963904)\n\n>“That’s probably even lower on our list” says FBI Director Wray of Putin request to interview former US Ambassador @McFaul which WH says Trump is considering.\n\nFrom [Walter Shaub](https://twitter.com/waltshaub/status/1019690516252938240) (Former Dir of Office of Gov Ethics)\n\n>This is stunning, outrageous and very very dangerous. The thought that the president would commit to even considering turning a former US Ambassador over to Russia — in connection with his federal service, no less — is amazing even for this administration. Where is Congress?!\n\nFrom [Garry Kasparov](https://twitter.com/Kasparov63/status/1019718210512392192):\n\n>Trump has already refused to defend US intelligence and institutions against Putin. I hope he has the decency to protect American citizens. Putin already abuses Interpol to "export" his repressive practices.\n\nFrom Ron Neumann (former ambassador and Pres. of American Academy of Diplomacy) via [Spencer Ackerman](https://twitter.com/attackerman/status/1019667553700937733)\n\n>"If the United States would make a former diplomat available for questioning by a foreign government without evidence of wrongdoing, then that would be quite horrifying," former amb. Ron Neumann, the president of the American Academy of Diplomacy, says about @McFaul.\n\nFrom [Ian Bremmer](https://twitter.com/ianbremmer/status/1019716882742628353):\n\n>WH needs to reject Putin request to interrogate @McFaul in strongest possible terms. Sanders “No Comment” does not cut it. \n\nFrom [Spencer Ackerman](https://twitter.com/attackerman/status/1019694704085094401):\n\n>To say U.S. diplomats are angry over this White House/McFaul business is a supreme understatement. Story forthcoming – with what is unquestionably the most profane quote I have ever received from a U.S. diplomat.\n\nFrom [Matt Tait](https://twitter.com/pwnallthethings/status/1019693706570600448):\n\n>The NSC won\'t look at the request. Because it\'s not *meant* to be looked at. It\'s an *intentionally absurd* request. What\'s outrageous is this wasn\'t obvious to SHS at the podium, and she lied to deflect that she didn\'t know/wasn\'t confident enough that the answer is "hell no"\n\nUpdated [from State Dept Spokesperson](https://twitter.com/OKnox/status/1019682040084561920) via Olivier Knox (CNN)\n\n>Meanwhile, a *vastly* different answer from State Department\'s @statedeptspox who calls the Russian accusations absolutely absurd.\n\nUpdated [statement](https://twitter.com/McFaul/status/1019680168095330304) from Ambassador McFaul:\n\n>I hope the White House corrects the record and denounces in categorical terms this ridiculous request from Putin. Not doing so creates moral equivalency between a legitimacy US indictment of Russian intelligence officers and a crazy, completely fabricated story invented by Putin\n\nFrom [Bill Browder](https://twitter.com/brookefoxnews/status/1019667928873144320):\n\n>POTUS doesn’t have jurisdiction over me bc I’m a British citizen.He’d have to discuss that w/ TheresaMay & I don’t think she’d be too happy about turning me over to Putin\n\nMore [Browder](https://twitter.com/AftertheBell/status/1019703350756036608):\n\n>"The people that surround the president have the absolute clear eyes on what\'s going on in Russia -but this nonsense of going up and flattering Vladimir Putin and then saying it\'s an incredible idea to hand over a bunch of anti-Putin activists, is just appalling."\n\nFrom [Tom Nichols](https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/1019664134634426368):\n\n>The *instant* answer should have been: “The President told Putin that he cannot deflect from his own corruption and abuses of his people by threatening US citizens, and that we will consider any further mention of @mcfaul as a threat to the safety of an American diplomat.”\n\nFrom [Natasha Bertrand](https://twitter.com/NatashaBertrand/status/1019664528991285249):\n\n>Undoing the Magnitsky Act sanctions is among Putin’s top priorities. It explains the Trump Tower meeting, the dinner where he & Trump discussed “adoptions” (sanctions) and the public remarks re: Browder. Seems like it’s all been leading up to this moment.\n\nFrom [Rick Wilson](https://twitter.com/TheRickWilson/status/1019691137597100032):\n\n>Watch Fox tonight try to turn @mcfaul and @Billbrowder into monsters tonight. It\'s inevitable.\n\nFrom [Susan Rice](https://twitter.com/AmbassadorRice/status/1019666890392768512):\n\n>Beyond outrageous. Amb. McFaul served our country honorably and with full diplomatic immunity. If the White House cannot defend and protect our diplomats, like our service members, they are serving a hostile foreign power not the American people. \n\nFrom [David Sanger](https://twitter.com/SangerNYT/status/1019661348257652736) (NYT):\n\n>For those keeping score at home, this means Putin asked the President  to let him get his hands on a former US ambassador to Russia, @McFaul, and man who successfully lobbied for one of the primary sanctions against Russia. And the WH can’t say how POTUS responded. Remarkable.\n\n**US CONGRESS**:\n\nFrom [Representative Eric Swalwell](https://twitter.com/RepSwalwell) (House Intel Committee) (D):\n\n>Take this to the bank, @realDonaldTrump: you turn over former U.S. Ambassador @McFaul to Putin, you can count on me and millions others to swiftly make you an ex-president.\n\nFrom [Senator Ron Wyden](https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/1019680918464851969) (D)\n\n>For @realDonaldTrump to help Putin harass and endanger @McFaul, an American ambassador, would meet my definition of providing aid and comfort to an enemy.\n\nFrom [Rep Bill Pascrell Jr.](https://twitter.com/BillPascrell/status/1019675920540553217) (D):\n\n>This is chilling. If Trump discussed handing over for "questioning" @Billbrowder & @McFaul to some Putin kangaroo court, we are entering dangerous new territory. Who knows what else he talked about w/the Russian dictator. This is why we must hear from the interpreter in the room.\n\nFrom [Sen Mark Warner](https://twitter.com/MarkWarner/status/1019694168740974594) (D)\n\n>We’re not turning @McFaul or any other American public servant over to Russia to be prosecuted for non-existent crimes. The White House should make that clear immediately. \n\nFrom [Rep Adam Schiff](https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/1019711861980323843) (D):\n\n>No "consultation" is needed to make clear that U.S. will never cooperate in Putin\'s crusade against Bill Browder or former U.S. officials, like Ambassador McFaul.\n\n>@McFaul served his country honorably. His freedom is not up for negotiation or to be offered up as a gift to Putin.\n\nFrom [Rep. David Cicilline](https://twitter.com/davidcicilline) (D):\n\n>If @realDonaldTrump can turn over @McFaul, a former US ambassador, to Putin, then he can do it to any of us. What the White House is saying is terrifying, and it should be getting a lot more coverage than it is. \n\nFrom [Rep. Ted Lieu](https://twitter.com/tedlieu/status/1019728072516530178) (D):\n\n>Dear @SecPompeo: THIS IS BATSHIT CRAZY. You need to put a stop to this notion immediately regarding giving @McFaul over to Russian operatives. American diplomats should never fear the US will hand them over to a foreign power. \n\nFrom [Rep. Nancy Pelosi](https://twitter.com/NancyPelosi/status/1019725252618727424) (D):\n\n>America’s diplomats deserve to know our president supports their work & won’t serve them up in a deeply misguided attempt to gain the approval of hostile foreign leaders. @realDonaldTrump must refuse Putin’s request.\n\nFrom [Sen. Bob Corker](https://twitter.com/SenBobCorker/status/1019706526536257536) (R):\n\n>Our committee looks forward to hearing from @SecPompeo next Wednesday at 2:30 p.m. ET.

"This isn't directly related to the article other than like the ambassador, I too am a veteran. I took part in a war that I felt conflicted about from the get go, but in my heart I believed that America generally ment well. And from my first hand experience I felt like my tour had a positive impact on the region. But now I ask, for what? It all seems so meaningless now. Nothing else has really taken the wind out of my sails as much as both Trump being elected, and his actions during his first year in office. He's tainted the executive branch of this government to a point where I now regret ever being an extension of it's influence."

'[HERE](http://jakebernstein.net/secrecyworld/trump-first-appearance-panama-papers) is the link to the original story by Jake Bernstein at jakebernstein.com I assume the site is not whitelisted so I posted the Daily News article instead. \n\nBut the original article contains more interesting details. \n\nFor example, where the dailynews says this...\n>Process Consultants was owned through so-called bearer shares, which can be used to transfer assets with complete anonymity. Such shares are popular among money launderers.\n\njakebernstein.com says this...\n>Process Consultans was owned through bearer shares. These share certificates were pieces of paper and whoever physically possessed them owned the company. For example, if Process bought an apartment in a Trump development, the company was the titleholder. Process itself was owned through two share certificates. If someone handed you those two pieces of paper, you would be the owner of the apartment. Bearer shares could be used to transfer assets completely anonymously. They were favorite tools of money launderers. For Mossack Fonseca, bearer shares were popular add-ons, a lucrative secrecy selling point.'

'>Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments.\n\n...says the guy who thought Frederick Douglass was alive.'
'/xpost from another thread\n\nOK, a lesson on Confederate Monuments from a Southerner, for those who may still be confused. \n\nConfederate Monuments were not built for historical reasons, they were constructed as a negative response to Reconstruction, in celebration of the rise of the Second KKK (and a movement known as the Invisible Empire), and a negative response to the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nThey were constructed in places that never were part of the Confederacy (like Ohio and Indiana), in white enclaves that wanted a symbol to keep out economically mobile black citizens.\n\nMuch of this born of the *Lost Cause* movement that has been romanticizing the Confederacy as plucky rebel under dogs who fought heroically for their way of life.  The truth though is that the Confederacy was started by wealthy plantation owners so that they could maintain their slave work force.  And to a large extent it was not fought by those families but by conscripted poor farmers, tradesmen and immigrants right off the ship.\n\nYou will often hear the terms Neo-Confederate and Neo-Nazi used interchangeably, that is because they both come from the same school of thought which classified the races in a hierarchical ladder of "fitness" which gained popularity in the 1890\'s and was used to convince people of the evolutionary superiority of the "white race".\n\nIt was during this time that the roots of Nazism started to form, and the Neo-Confederate Movement (KKK, Invisible Empire, etc) started to gain influence in the United States.  While Nazis had few decades to really get a foothold, the Neo-Confederates quickly latched onto white resentment against economically successful minorities and were able to gain considerable political power.  While those monuments started going up all over the South (and other places) the State Houses began passing Jim Crow laws and setting the stage for what came to be known as the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nIn conclusion, these monuments have **nothing** to do with the history of the Civil War, they are Totems of Racism.  They have **nothing** to do with heritage, they are rallying points of White Supremacy.  They have **no place** in our society if we want a culture of inclusion and equality.\n\n-----\n\n*edit*: Thank you for the Gold, and for those who wish to share this to a wider audience, I would suggest adding these Wikipedia footnotes that I gave to another redditor \n\n[Lost Cause of the Confederacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy)\n\n[Neo-Confederacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Confederate)\n\n[The Second KKK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan#Second_KKK)\n\n[Jim Crow Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws)\n\n[History of White Supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy)\n\nAs well as [this timeline of when the statues were erected](http://i.imgur.com/iJPkwRq.jpg)'
"Trump's strategy here is clear. He thinks that the more dems talk about race, the more they lose.\n\nWe'll see how it pans out. I certainly am inclined to agree--at least in Midwestern states."
"You know what? Take away the historical context and he's got a point. Some Confederate statues are pretty. Much like how stripped of historical context, the swastika is a neat little symbol. Good symmetry. I'm sure he thinks it's a shame the Germans stopped using it for some reason."
'From a friend of mine:\n\n"Taking down the statues of traitors isn\'t erasing history -- it is changing how we view and remember it. The confederates were not heroes. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were imperfect men that strove for a more perfect union. Yes, they were slave owners, that is a blight to their character that should never be forgotten. But remember -- without them, we don\'t have the United States.\n\nConfederates were traitors that wanted to preserve the peculiar institution, that same institution that our country was finally ready to dismiss.\n\nStop defending the worst of us, and start celebrating the best of us. Tear them all down."'
"We need more statues celebrating our WWII victory and honoring the Jewish victims. I'm sure these history-loving white nationalists would be happy to see that. "
"Remember when conservatives used to bash Obama for fueling racial division? LOL, \n\nTrump's like hold my beer. "
'Putting aside the ridiculous implication that these Confederate statues are somehow unique works of art that could never be adequately replaced by similarly constructed/designed statues honoring more positive US historical figures (like various civil rights leaders or other political leaders), there are two other incredibly troubling aspects to this story.\n\nFirst, Trump seems to think (or at least imply) that we learn/remember history by public monuments. I\'m sorry (not really) Mr. President, but when I studied for my history degree in college, we didn\'t spend each class out staring at a statue. We read books, studied letters and manuscripts and speeches from the time periods we were studying, analzyed trends and data points. There are plenty of ways to remember and learn from history without having to erect and protect monuments honoring and celebrating some of the worst figures in our history.\n\nBy this same logic, Germany should have several statues honoring Hitler and other Nazi figures, so that they can "learn from their history." It\'s an asinine claim. You don\'t learn from historical evils by celebrating them.\n\nThe second troubling aspect to his statement is that he called it "**our** beautitful statues and monuments." This implies that he identifies with those white supremacists seeking to protect and maintain these Confederate statues (also ignoring the fact that most of these statues were built/put in place in the 20th century as part of the Jim Crow era and backlash to the civil rights movement).\n\nHopefully, this is the hill this presidency dies on. '
"I don't understand why Confederate generals or leaders should be revered at all? People like Washington or Jefferson, despite their failings on slaves, accomplished net positives for the country. They created it and made it relatively egalitarian and that's entirely positive. \n\nWhat good did Stonewall Jackson deliver?"
"I don't understand the idea that by removing statues we remove the ability of people to learn about subjects that monuments depict. Frankly, there's more to be learned about Robert E. Lee from one of his many biographies than from some plaque under a statue.\n\nPublic monuments are not for educational instruction; they are for expression of values, and thus these ones (not being compatible with present-day America's values) need to go. It's hardly the burning of books. "
'TIL "Lets move historically relevant statues from public spaces of honor maintained in part by the tax dollars of those that don\'t wish to honor Confederate soldiers with said tax dollars to museums and/or battlefields dedicated to the careful preservation of historical artifacts" is tantamount to the destruction of the American way of life.'

'The myth of the "conservative Democrat" needed to win Republican votes is dying with each election.\n\n> “On Monday, 11,965 registered Republicans voted early (either in-person or vote-by-mail) compared to 11,798 Democrats — for a turnout already well over 22 percent.” “Among early returns, Good bettered Buchanan 55 to 43 percent with vote-by-mail and early in-person voting.” That represents nearly two thirds of the total vote and it shows a lot of Republicans voting for the Democrat.\n\nThis means out of a 50/50ish split, she got Republicans to BREAK party and vote ... but what are her positions. [These are direct from her website](https://margaretgood.com/) ...\n\n* ENVIRONMENT - Climate change is real and she will protect Florida from special interest groups\n\n* EDUCATION - Pro Public schools and against charter schools\n\n* JOBS - Pro middle class\n\n* HEALTHCARE - expanding on Medicaid\n\n* REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS - Margaret is pro-choice. \n\n* LGBTQ+ - Margaret is a staunch supporter of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nThose are NOT conservative positions, those are left of Center to almost progressive positions. \n\nCheck out the district on ballotpedia, it\'s been Republican for a while - https://ballotpedia.org/Florida_House_of_Representatives_District_72\n\n> This past weekend, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski rallied supporters on behalf of Buchanan, alongside former deputy campaign manager David Bossie. Voters at the event reportedly broke out into a “lock her up” chant.\n\nThey even brought out the "base" of the new right and played the "hits" (sidenote: is "Lock her up" the new "freebird" of the Republican party) to crowds, but it doesn\'t seem to be working. This is even when Trump is experiencing his "best" polling numbers (they are still very low, but his highest in a while). Even with the Tax Plan ... \n\nWhat is even more impressive is that James Buchanan, the Republican opponent, is the son of Congressman Vern Buchanan a local congressman. He held rallies to get out the vote, sent registration material overseas to people, they pulled out all the stops!\n\nIt\'s 90% white, so it\'s not like she pulled out the minority vote to change this. She got Republicans to switch sides and elect a Democrat. \n\nSo what does this tell us? Well first is the Democratic base is energized ... Trump is turning off more Republicans than he is bringing in for these smaller elections. It\'s going to be an interesting November...'

'This \n\n>“Alabama was a huge blow to his psyche,” a person close to Trump said. “He saw the cult of personality was broken.”\n\nWas always the danger of Trump\'s Presidency.\n\nA man who has built his entire governing philosophy on never losing is in a position where you absolutely cannot always win.\n\nThe President has to be able to move on from defeat, and Trump cannot process defeat. He just can\'t. \n\nThe Alabama primary race isn\'t even ideologically something Trump cares about. Hell Moore is probably right up his alley politically. \n\nBut what he cannot abide is a loss. It isn\'t like he\'s losing a senate seat or losing an ally in the Senate. Moore will probably be a staunch Trump ally on many policies. That dude is all for your wall buddy. \n\nBut he backed the wrong horse and the whole world can see. Even though most of us don\'t really care about who Trump endorsed in the Alabama Senate primary, and would prefer that Moore wasn\'t going to be the next Senator from Alabama, this is something that wounds him. \n\nThe Presidency isn\'t about winning all the time. It\'s not about being right all the time. It\'s about getting as much done as you can that you believe serves the American people\'s interests. \n\nYou win some, you lose some is not in Trump\'s vocabulary. He will never say it. \n\nLook at any interview where Obama discusses his defeats or shortcomings. Not once could you say that it broke him. He will admit to extreme frustration, he will make excuses, and he will even blame other people sometimes (Republicans in Congress), but he never gave up or melted down or flipped out like this "President" \n\nTrump never understood how much losing he would have to do as President. It\'s baked into the job, and any idiot with a passing knowledge of the office could tell you that. \n\nI think Trump seriously believed that everything would go perfectly for him all the time always. \n\nHe thought he could please all of the people all of the time.

'>Erik Prince, the private security contractor and the former head of Blackwater, arranged the meeting, which took place on Aug. 3, 2016. The emissary, George Nader, told Donald Trump Jr. that the crown princes who led Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were eager to help his father win election as president. The social media specialist, Joel Zamel, extolled his company’s ability to give an edge to a political campaign; by that time, the firm had already drawn up a multimillion-dollar proposal for a social media manipulation effort to help elect Mr. Trump.\n\nHoly shit. Trump was soliciting foreign interference in our election left and right.  What did he promise in exchange? \n\nGeorge Nader is cooperating with Mueller already right? '
'The three things that stick out to me about this:\n\n1. George Nader was in the middle of this supposedly. He has been cooperating. So... Mueller must know a shit ton.\n\n2. I don\'t see how if they actually go after the upper echelon Trump admin they don\'t go after Prince at this point between Seychelles, lying deliberately to Congress, and this new meeting he brokered as  well.  (allegedly).  \n\n3. I believe we will find out Trump made the decision to leave the Iran deal over 2 years ago, at a minimum, under the advice of foreign countries involved with giving his family money and business. Recall he has spent the last 18 months pretending like it was a matter under consideration but...\n\n**This story adds:** "At the time, Mr. Nader was also promoting a secret plan to use private contractors to destabilize Iran, the regional nemesis of Saudi Arabia and the Emirates."\n\nAnd we already know that prior to re-certifying the Iran Nuke deal in 2017, Trump was threatening to leave the Iran deal and a number of stories indicated Trump had already decided to leave what he repeatedly had called one of the worst deals ever.  Definitely-not-a-Nazi-Gorka said at the time,  “He’s not going to re-certify,” said Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump national security aide. “I’m not worried. His gut instinct is absolutely right.” \n\nMore interestingly, this was despite that fact that Rex  Tillerson, and General Mattis, were trying to talk Trump out of de-certifying the deal. Along with the leaders of France and Britain. (Macron and May).  https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-trump/trump-resists-pressure-to-soften-stance-on-iran-nuclear-deal-idUSKBN1CH01D .\n\nFor instance, Mattis, who has gone out of his way not to publicly disagree with Trump on nearly anything, described the Iran deal as imperfect.  But he also noted inspectors authority to inspect under the current Iran deal is, robust, intrusive, and written under the assumption that Iran will try to cheat.  http://thehill.com/policy/defense/385094-mattis-defends-iran-deal-as-trump-considers-withdrawal.  You can also see Mattis explaining that in his opinion, staying within the agreement is **“clearly” in America’s best interest** in the absence of evidence that Iran is violating the agreement. https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4684427/defense-secretary-suggests-sticking-iran-nuclear-deal\n\nAnd Sexy **Rexy, recertified** Iran’s compliance with the Nuke deal in 2017.  Trump was not a big fan of this.  In fact, it pissed Trump off quite a bit, and in my speculative opinion, was a major contributing reason to Trump deciding it was too politically damaging to pull out of the Iran deal in 2017.  \n\nSo, what did Trump do? He created a team in the White House to find an excuse to break the Iran deal because he felt the State Department was failing to do that for him.  http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/07/21/trump-assigns-white-house-team-to-target-iran-nuclear-deal-sidelining-state-department/ .  \n\nTrump’s people also apparently hired a foreign intelligence firm to dig up personal dirt on the people who originally negotiated the Iran deal.  This is supposed to have happened last May.  https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/05/trump-team-hired-spy-firm-dirty-ops-iran-nuclear-deal?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_reddit_is_fun . \n\nAfter those teams were put in place, you may recall **Rexy was eventually fired** unceremoniously and replaced with friendly Mike Pompeo.  One reason for that, according to Trump himself, was Tillerson was resisting pulling out of the Iran deal.  Pompeo on the other hand, shares Trump’s views.  http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-fired-tillerson-iran-deal-disagreement-2018-3 ,\n\n**Conclusion:** When Trump can\'t stay on message with his legal team for a day, (or remember the difference between HPV and HIV, or Life Insurance/Health insurance), what does it mean when he has laser focus and zeal for a random treaty for 2 straight years?  **Money.**\n\n**edit new info:** And now it appears Mueller was so interested in this second Trump tower meeting that he sent investigators to Israel and also seized computers there with the help of local law enforcement?\n\nYou know where this is a political group that really doesn\'t like the Iran deal?  Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...\n\n"The report, citing four sources, said that a company linked to Zamel, Psy-Group, was working on an online manipulation campaign that involved usage thousands of fake social media accounts to help Trump get elected. The report, Zamel himself was questioned by Mueller\'s investigators and at least two FBI agents were sent to Israel to interview the company\'s employees. Mueller\'s team also worked with the Israel Police to seize computers of one of Zamel\'s firms. The New York Times notes that there were concerns inside the company about the plan\'s legality, since U.S. law prohibits non-Americans from being involved in the election."\n\nhttps://www.haaretz.com/us-news/mueller-s-team-questioned-witnesses-in-israel-seized-computers-1.6098364\n\nedit 2: Just changing bolding around because too much of it is against the rules.'

'Fuck the paywall\n\n**Trump Jr. and Other Aides Met With Gulf Emissary Offering Help to Win Election**\n\nDonald Trump Jr. met in Trump Tower in the summer of 2016 with a representative of two wealthy Arab princes who said they were eager to help his father win election.\n\nBy Mark Mazzetti, Ronen Bergman and David D. Kirkpatrick\n\n**May 19, 2018\nWASHINGTON** — Three months before the 2016 election, a small group gathered at Trump Tower to meet with Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son. One was an Israeli specialist in social media manipulation. Another was an emissary for two wealthy Arab princes. The third was a Republican donor with a controversial past in the Middle East as a private security contractor.\n\nThe meeting was convened primarily to offer help to the Trump team, and it forged relationships between the men and Trump insiders that would develop over the coming months — past the election and well into President Trump’s first year in office, according to several people with knowledge of their encounters.\n\nErik Prince, the private security contractor and the former head of Blackwater, arranged the meeting, which took place on Aug. 3, 2016. The emissary, George Nader, told Donald Trump Jr. that the crown princes who led Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were eager to help his father win election as president. The social media specialist, Joel Zamel, extolled his company’s ability to give an edge to a political campaign; by that time, the firm had already drawn up a multimillion-dollar proposal for a social media manipulation effort to help elect Mr. Trump.\n\nThe company, which employed several Israeli former intelligence officers, specialized in collecting information and shaping opinion through social media.\n\n\nIt is unclear whether such a proposal was executed, and the details of who commissioned it remain in dispute. But Donald Trump Jr. responded approvingly, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting, and after those initial offers of help, Mr. Nader was quickly embraced as a close ally by Trump campaign advisers — meeting frequently with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, and Michael T. Flynn, who became the president’s first national security adviser. At the time, Mr. Nader was also promoting a secret plan to use private contractors to destabilize Iran, the regional nemesis of Saudi Arabia and the Emirates.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Nader paid Mr. Zamel a large sum of money, described by one associate as up to $2 million. There are conflicting accounts of the reason for the payment, but among other things, a company linked to Mr. Zamel provided Mr. Nader with an elaborate presentation about the significance of social media campaigning to Mr. Trump’s victory.\n\nThe meetings, which have not been reported previously, are the first indication that countries other than Russia may have offered assistance to the Trump campaign in the months before the presidential election. The interactions are a focus of the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, who was originally tasked with examining possible Trump campaign coordination with Russia in the election.\n\nMr. Nader is cooperating with the inquiry, and investigators have questioned numerous witnesses in Washington, New York, Atlanta, Tel Aviv and elsewhere about what foreign help may have been pledged or accepted, and about whether any such assistance was coordinated with Russia, according to witnesses and others with knowledge of the interviews.\n\n\nThe interviews, some in recent weeks, are further evidence that special counsel’s investigation remains in an intense phase even as Mr. Trump’s lawyers are publicly calling for Mr. Mueller to bring it to a close.\n\nIt is illegal for foreign governments or individuals to be involved in American elections, and it is unclear what — if any — direct assistance Saudi Arabia and the Emirates may have provided. But two people familiar with the meetings said that Trump campaign officials did not appear bothered by the idea of cooperation with foreigners.\n\nA lawyer for Donald Trump Jr., Alan Futerfas, said in a statement that “prior to the 2016 election, Donald Trump Jr. recalls a meeting with Erik Prince, George Nader and another individual who may be Joel Zamel. They pitched Mr. Trump Jr. on a social media platform or marketing strategy. He was not interested and that was the end of it.”\n\nThe August 2016 meeting has echoes of another Trump Tower meeting two months earlier, also under scrutiny by the special counsel, when Donald Trump Jr. and other top campaign aides met with a Russian lawyer after being promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton. No evidence has emerged suggesting that the August meeting was set up with a similar premise.\n\nThe revelations about the meetings come in the midst of new scrutiny about ties between Mr. Trump’s advisers and at least three wealthy Persian Gulf states. Besides his interest in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, Mr. Mueller has also been asking witnesses about meetings between White House advisers and representatives of Qatar, Saudi Arabia’s bitter rival.\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Zamel denied that his client had carried out any campaign on Mr. Trump’s behalf. “Neither Joel Zamel, nor any of his related entities, had any involvement whatsoever in the U.S. election campaign,” said the lawyer, Marc L. Mukasey.\n\n“The D.O.J. clarified from Day 1 that Joel and his companies have never been a target of the investigation. My client provided full cooperation to the government to assist with their investigation,” he said.\n\nKathryn Ruemmler, a lawyer for Mr. Nader, said, “Mr. Nader has fully cooperated with the special counsel’s investigation and will continue to do so.” A senior official in Saudi Arabia said it had never employed Mr. Nader in any capacity or authorized him to speak for the crown prince.\n\nMr. Prince, through a spokesman, declined to comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n**Advisers to the Court**\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, the de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates, and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, the king’s main adviser, had long opposed many of the Obama administration’s policies toward the Middle East. They resented President Barack Obama’s agreement with Iran over its nuclear program, his statements of support for the Arab Spring uprisings and his hands-off approach to the Syrian civil war.\n\nNews outlets linked to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates fiercely criticized Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, when she was secretary of state, and diplomats familiar with their thinking say both crown princes hoped for a president who would take a stronger hand in the region against both Iran and groups like the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nMr. Nader had worked for years as a close adviser to Crown Prince Mohammed of Abu Dhabi, and Mr. Zamel had worked for the Emirati royal court as a consultant as well. When Mr. Trump locked up the Republican presidential nomination in early 2016, Mr. Nader began making inquiries on behalf of the Emirati prince about possible ways to directly support Mr. Trump, according to three people with whom Mr. Nader discussed his efforts.\n\nMr. Nader also visited Moscow at least twice during the presidential campaign as a confidential emissary from Crown Prince Mohammed of Abu Dhabi, according to people familiar with his travels. After the election, he worked with the crown prince to arrange a meeting in the Seychelles between Mr. Prince and a financier close to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.\n\nCompanies connected to Mr. Zamel also have ties to Russia. One of his firms had previously worked for oligarchs linked to Mr. Putin, including Oleg V. Deripaska and Dmitry Rybolovlev, who hired the firm for online campaigns against their business rivals.\n\nMr. Deripaska, an aluminum magnate, was once in business with the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who has pleaded not guilty in the special counsel investigation to charges of financial crimes and failing to disclose the lobbying work he did on behalf of a former president of Ukraine, an ally of Mr. Putin. Mr. Rybolovlev once purchased a Florida mansion from Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Nader’s visits to Russia and the work Mr. Zamel’s companies did for the Russians have both been a subject of interest to the special counsel’s investigators, according to people familiar with witness interviews.\n\n'
'This is hilarious. The alt right calls everybody Sharia Blue when in reality Saudi Arabia wanted Trump to win 🤔'
"All signs point to an administration whose national security policy is for sale to foreign autocrats. That's effectively treason."
"Because of all the media focus on Russia, Trump has been unable to deliver much of what Putin wanted, which has given his supporters some deniability.\n\nHe's handed some pretty amazing wins to the Saudis though, going to be much easier to prove quid pro quo.\n\n"
">They pitched Mr. Trump Jr. on a social media platform or marketing strategy. He was not interested and that was the end of it.”\n\nOh yeah, free help worth millions that he barely has to put any effort into, sounds like something that wouldn't hold his interest. \n\nAnd we already know he either didn't care or was oblivious to the rule about help from foreign governments.\n\n>He replied within minutes: “If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.”"
'Not just Russia then. Amazing.\n\nThis is huge because before they could have defended saying "Well, Russia may have interfered, but we had nothing to do with it!" Now it\'s clear that they were soliciting help, and not just from Russia.'

He then introduced Mr. Nader as an old friend with deep ties to Arab leaders. \n\nMr. Nader repeatedly referred to the crown princes of Saudi Arabia and the Emirates as “my friends,” according to one person with knowledge of the conversation. To underscore the point, he would open his mobile phone to show off pictures of him posing with them, some of which The New York Times obtained.\n\nAfter Trump was elected, Nader paid the Israeli specialist up to $2 million. \n\nThere are conflicting accounts of the reason for the payment, but among other things, a company linked to the specialist provided Nader with a presentation about the significance of social media to Trump’s victory.\n\nIt is illegal for foreign governments or individuals to be involved in American elections.\n\nTwo people familiar with the meetings told NYT that Trump campaign officials did not appear bothered by the idea of cooperation with foreigners.\n\nThe Trump campaign’s interactions with these officials are now a subject of Mueller’s investigation, NYT reports.\n\nGeorge Nader, who worked with Crown Prince Mohammed of Abu Dhabi to arrange that Seychelles meeting between Erik Prince and a financier close to Putin, also visited Moscow at least twice during the campaign as a confidential emissary of the crown prince.\n\nCompanies connected to Joel Zamel, the Israeli specialist, have ties to Russia.

"I'm sure the Trump Regime will continue attempting to disclaim Papadopoulos.\n\nBut the key to remember is that certain actions, words, and statuses have legal consequences.

But the determination is generally objective, based on what others were told or what they outwardly perceived. "

I know you're uncomfortable doing that for obvious reasons but I think you've long ago passed the point where there is any hope of bringing these people back to the middle/reality. \n\nIf I was an American I would be far more concerned about what Trump voters mean for the country in the long term rather than Trump himself (who it increasingly looks like will be gone before 2020)."

But, with that being said, Russia should be in this meeting, why are we having a meeting without Russia being in the meeting? And I would recommend, and it\'s up to them, but Russia should be in the meeting, it should be a part of it.

"When Trump was first elected, I had a good time laughing at the situation.\n\nAs his presidency progressed I was more and more concerned about what was happening.\n\nAt this point in time, nothing surprises me anymore, nothing even makes me mad anymore. \n\nI now expect the worst to be true, stories like this aren't even infuriating. It's just par for the course. "
'It\'s not a given that people know why it\'s a bad thing for a supposedly non-partisan election panel, and a lot of people don\'t know how bad Breitbart is. They just hear that it\'s right-wing or associated with Trump or Republicans and don\'t hear examples.\n\nScreenshots of how bad their headlines are: https://www.google.com/search?q=breitbart+headline&tbm=isch\n\nHow Steve Bannon targets what he calls "rootless white males" to "radicalize":\n\n>to the power of what he called “rootless white males” who spend all their time online. And five years later when Bannon wound up at Breitbart, he resolved to try and attract those people over to Breitbart because he thought they could be radicalized in a kind of populist, nationalist way.\n>\n>And the way that Bannon did that, the bridge between the angry abusive gamers and Breitbart and Pepe was Milo Yiannopoulous, who Bannon discovered and hired to be Breitbart’s tech editor.\n>\n>From the time I met him in 2011, he’s had exactly the same politics. The same stuff you heard from Trump, you saw on the campaign trail. What he was looking for was a vessel because nobody in Republican Washington believed in these kinds of ideas. Very big into the idea of populism and Palin had emerged from the 2008 election as kind of the populist Tea Party champion. So originally, Palin went to Bannon and said, “Hey, you’re a filmmaker, you’re a conservative guy. Would you shoot some commercials for me, some kind of videos?” And Bannon, as he is prone to do, got whipped into a frenzy. Wound up spending about $1 million of his own money to produce this elaborate Palin documentary called “The Undefeated,” which he thought was going to be Palin’s vehicle to run for the presidency. In fact, the first time I ever traveled with Bannon and Palin was to Pella, Iowa to debut that film. Everybody in the national media was there. Andrew Breitbart was there. Sarah Palin was there because we all thought this was the wink wink launch of the “Sarah Palin for President” campaign in 2012, but when that thing kind of crashed on the launchpad, Bannon moved on to other people and eventually wound up with Trump.\n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/steve-bannon-white-gamers-seinfeld-joshua-green-donald-trump-devils-bargain-sarah-palin-world-warcraft-gamergate-2017-7\n\nThe billionaire behind Breitbart and Steve Bannon:\n\n>They own part of the data mining company Cambridge Analytica, which played a role in Trump\'s victory last year. That has given both Mercers a strong foothold in the Trump White House, and last year Politico called Rebekah Mercer "The Most Powerful Woman in GOP Politics." Mercer\'s influence hasn\'t been confined to the United States: He was a key supporter of Leave.eu, which spearheaded last summer\'s successful Brexit campaign.\n>\n>Among other things, Mercer said the United States went in the wrong direction after the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and also insisted the only remaining racists in the United States were African-Americans, according to Magerman.\n>\n>... that climate change is not happening. It\'s not for real, and if it is happening, it\'s going to be good for the planet.\n>\n>... that nuclear war is really not such a big deal. And they\'ve actually argued that outside of the immediate blast zone in Japan during World War II - outside of Hiroshima and Nagasaki - that the radiation was actually good for the Japanese. So they see a kind of a silver lining in nuclear war and nuclear accidents. Bob Mercer has certainly embraced the view that radiation could be good for human health - low level radiation.\n\nhttp://www.npr.org/2017/05/26/530181660/robert-mercer-is-a-force-to-be-reckoned-with-in-finance-and-conservative-politic\n\nAnother billionaire connected with Breitbart for the Alt-Right\'s coordinated manipulation of Reddit:\n\n[Palmer Luckey: The Facebook Near-Billionaire Secretly Funding Trump’s Meme Machine](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/22/palmer-luckey-the-facebook-billionaire-secretly-funding-trump-s-meme-machine.html)\n\n>“We conquered Reddit and drive narrative on social media, conquered the [mainstream media], now it’s time to get our most delicious memes in front of Americans whether they like it or not,” a representative for the group wrote in an introductory post on Reddit.\n>\n>Palmer Luckey—founder of Oculus—is funding a Trump group that circulates dirty memes about Hillary Clinton.\n>\n>“I’ve got plenty of money,” Luckey added. “Money is not my issue.

The bleached-blonde political agitator is most notable for being permanently suspended from Twitter for harassment after a series of abusive messages to actress Leslie Jones.\n>\n>Luckey first met the alt-right provocateur in Los Angeles about a year and a half ago, before Yiannopoulos began working on a charity to send white men to college. The Daily Beast later reported that the scholarship fund had resulted in zero financial distribution of the donations that had been made directly to Yiannopoulos’s bank account.\n>\n>“I came into touch with them over Facebook,” Luckey said of the band of trolls behind the operation. “It went along the lines of ‘hey, I have a bunch of money.

"Protecting our votes is the biggest single issue facing our country right now.\n\nHere's the good thing - its in the hands of the states and if enough Americans start complaining to their state's reps there is a good chance to reform how our elections are conducted."
"I'd just like to apologize on behalf of all 8 of us in Kansas who vote intelligently that we are sorry our state produced this piece of trash."
'The best people'
"I enjoy going to Breitbart comments for my daily dose of crazy. It's fun getting into it with those guys."
'I heard an interview on NPR with some honcho associated with this show. He said that after the first season the Great Negotiator demanded a million bucks per show. He got $50K. That pretty much sums up a lot of what has been transpiring of late.'
'I know a lot of former friends who are Trump Supporters who said one of the reasons they voted for Trump was due to them "watching the Apprentice" and they "wanted to be successful like him." I wonder how you come to grips with finding out it was a false image to begin with.'
"The best part of this is that it is published in a popular gossip magazine and it therefore might reach some of Trump's supporters."
'I worked on a reality show that first cast Kevin O’Leary and Robert Herjavec 15 years ago. (Shark Tank)\n\nAt that time they were not billionaires or even multi millionaires. \n\nBut we said their companies were worth billions.... but all of companies they owned were private so we never knew. Each episode started with a montage of them looking rich and acting rich.  But in the actual world of business they are pretty average at best.\n\nEventually I realized people believe they are billionaires is because we tv producers said they were billionaires. No one questioned it. That is the power of TV messaging... if the TV says so ... it’s true.'
"Funny story that happened today. \n\nCo-worker: I know Trump isn't perfect but at least we have a person who can run a successful business running this country. \n\nMe: hasn't he filed for bankruptcy multiple times?\n\nCo-worker: yeah but who doesn't. You gotta stop giving him so much crap. \n\nCo-worker leaves room. \n"
'Anyone that\'s seen an episode of that show should know that. The show is full of staged phone calls and walk-and-talk conversations where he pretends to be busy and important. "I gotta let you go, Ted Turner, I\'m on my way to my TV show." He was and still is a cartoon of what the average person thinks a rich person is like.'
"trump is the 'billionaire' that millionaires point and laugh at...\nOkay so everyone points and laughs at him. "
'Trump has been a well known con man on the eastern seaboard since the 80s; people stopped doing business with him and he became the same kind of running joke that east coasters love to hate, like Rhode Island politics (if you’re not familiar, check out Buddy Cianci sometime, guy’s a hoot).\n\nThe fact that anyone east of Indiana fell for his song and dance continues to baffle me (but then again, Cianci).'
"The guys that were making it thought it was hilarious seeing a failed businessman who's worth maybe $150 million living in a gold palace like he's part of the ultra rich. \nThey thought it was funny that he suddenly had a company to run when, in reality, all he did was license out his recognizable name to real estate developers, primarily overseas. \nThen they got wide eyed when they realized that most of America didn't get the joke. "
"It's like professional wrestling in the 80s and 90s: most fans of course knew it was all theater, but watched anyway.  It was entertaining to watch big lugs badly act out these fantastic scenario.  Trump was a big gaudy moron who had money, flashed it around, covered all his things with gold, surrounded himself with desirable women and pretended to be the ultimate businessman playboy.  \n\n\nMost of the people who watched his shtick were really just laughing at the outlandishness of it.  Sadly as with professional wrestling, a portion of the fans never matured, and refused to concede that their TV heroes were just a part being played.  Their fan bases overlap, as do those of Fox News and Santa Claus, and I'll stop there. "
"I'd be very curious to know about how much money Trump actually has and what portion of his wealth over the years is tied to or borrowed from Russian oligarchs."
'This is the second or third piece from People magazine this week that throws shade at Trump.  Funny, because for years and years they have been feeding into his hype machine that he is a glamorous and successful tycoon.  They helped build his brand.'
'never underestimate the stupidity of the American public. "It\'s on TEEVEE, it HAS to be real!!!!"'
"Lol That episode of Black Mirror (waldo moment) predicted the future. A fictional character was elected president. What's hilarious is that episode was panned for being unrealistic before trump"
'>Steve was a staffer who worked for me after I had already won the nomination by defeating seventeen candidates, often described as the most talented field ever assembled in the Republican party.\n\nlol'
">Statement from Trump:\n\n>**Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency.** When he was fired, he not only lost his job, **he lost his mind.** Steve was a staffer who worked for me after I had already won the nomination by defeating seventeen candidates, often described as the most talented field ever assembled in the Republican party.\n\n>Now that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn't as easy as I make it look. **Steve had very little to do with our historic victory**, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country. Yet Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans.\n\n>Steve doesn't represent my base-**he's only in it for himself.**\n\n>**Steve pretends to be at war with the media**, which he calls the opposition party, yet **he spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was. It is the only thing he does well. Steve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me** and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue, whom he helped write phony books.\n\n\n>We have many great Republican members of Congress and candidates who are very supportive of the Make America Great Again agenda. Like me, they love the United States of America and are helping to finally take our country back and build it up, rather than simply seeking to burn it all down."
"So Trump supporters, Trump has done a great job in the last year picking his allies hasn't he? Can't imagine what it would be like if he was constantly firing and fighting with his staff.. "

"I just, really don't care.  We already know he is a womanizing asshole, and those who still support him are going to keep on supporting him and ignore the bits they don't like.\n\nIt's a stupid distraction and won't make any kind of impact politically."
'Ha! This is awesome! Stormy Daniels is quickly becoming my favorite porn star of all time.'
"I have a serious question for any Christian Trump supporters who happen to be looking at this.  How can you support a man who is actively behaving counter to the teachings of Jesus Christ?  Please read the words of the man your religion is named for... do you just not care?  Is your religion only important when it is convenient?  Whether he had intercourse with this woman is irrelevant really.  He is an adulterer by Jesus's own definition.\n\nhttps://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10&version=ESV"
"Meh, it's pretty baked into the public opinion that Trump is lecherous pig\n\nLook into premillennialism as to why religious groups such as evangelicals support him despite his moral shortcomings.  There's a reason that having Jerusalem the capital of Israel is so important to these groups and it has little to do with their compassion for Judaism"
'I wonder how many unscrupulous pornstars keep ‘Monica Lewinsky dresses’ after a night of sex with rich and influential men for ‘safe keeping’.'
'Donald’s comment: Stormy - yeah I tapped  that.  She’s at least an 8. Great ride.  The best.  What she said was Donald I’ve been with thousands of men, but Donald your the best. Huge.  And after,  we did it again.  Four times.  No 400 times.  Great night.  The best.  She said Donald you should be president- so here I am.   \n\nAnd his polling numbers go up'
"But the thing is, even if this dress is authentic and the allegations of the affair are true, it will not affect President Trump's support level. Trump voters already knew for whom they were pulling the lever for, and it was not because Trump was a choir boy. Non-political indiscretion was part of the package."
'Does this surprise anybody? Trump is a sexual predator, the republican party is the party of sexual predators right now. \n\nVote them all out of office.  '
"This will just make his base like him more. This is not an explosive or even unexpected allegation, it's 100% consistent with everything we already know about him, to the point that I'd be shocked if this *wasn't* the case. \n\nIt's sad, but in the eyes of his base this just makes him a totally  badass alpha male who does the shit they wish they could get away with. "
'"He\'s just doing what we all wish we could do."- Trump supporters  \n\nNo. I am a happily married man and if I wanted hookers, I\'m a couple of hours from Sparks, NV. I love my wife and my family and that is simply not something that interests me.  \n\n"He\'s just saying what we are all thinking."- Trump supporters  \n\nNo. I am not a racist, nor a bigot, nor an ignorant megalomaniac. Very few things he says are actually things that I think. And, I\'m fairly certain I speak for the vast majority of my friends.  \n\nThat, Trump supporters, is why you are in the minority. Bigly.

'If it happened in a vacuum, it would be... but you have to figure that if you got together a top ten list of "Most Disgraceful Performances by and American President",  Like 8 of them would have happened in the past two years.\n\nAt this point, Trump\'s just pretty much running up the score and competing with himself.

"Yeah, I tend to be a moderate on this forum, and an independent in voting...\n\nThat was an outrageously, and I mean, *devastatingly* transparent showing of Russian strength and American weakness. \n\nNot only that, but American interest in subverting its own power and interests for the sake of Russian interests. \n\nFrom an informed, moderate view, that was unreal, and cannot be overstated in significance. \n\nI'll be making decisions that impact my day to day life based off of the last few hours information. "
"I am a Canadian.  I used to love America.  Sure, your guys' politics seemed a little crazy to us.  Your obsession with guns seemed a little nuts.  But I loved America on the world stage.  It was the world leader for human rights, it stood up for democracy and freedom.  It liberated Europe.  It was the architect of the post-war world order.  It defeated the USSR.  Sure there were mistakes, even glaring ones, like Iraq 2003.  But in general, it made the world a better place.  It was the shining city on the hill.    \n\nThis is really sad.  The American President is clearly infatuated with the Russian President.  His judgement is clearly compromised.  This is obvious to anyone who watches him.  America is no longer to world's moral leader.  It is a client to the world's gangster state.  \n\nWe are witnessing the decline of the American-led World Order, and we will all be worse off because of it.  "
"This is all hilarious in a sort of dark humor/twisted way. Because it's all right fucking THERE! And America doesn't give a shit.

"Here is some of his latest word salad from the press conference:\n\n>So let me just say that we have two thoughts: You have groups that are wondering why the FBI never took the server. Why haven’t they taken the server? Why was the FBI told to leave the office of the Democratic National Committee? I’ve been wondering that. I’ve been asking that for months and months, and I’ve been tweeting it out and calling it out on social media. Where is the server? I want to know where is the server and what is the server saying? ...I have President Putin, he just said it's not Russia. I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be, but I really do want to see the server. But I have — I have confidence in both parties. I really believe that this will probably go on for a while, but I don't think it can go on without finding out what happened to the server. What happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC? Where are those servers? They're missing. Where are they? What happened to Hillary Clinton's emails? 33,000 emails gone, just gone. "
'I would like to know how Trump has personally made YOUR life better since becoming president. I’m not trying to be argumentative or go tit for tat. I honestly want to understand. '

A disability should not constitute grounds for the automatic per se denial of any right or privilege, including gun ownership.\n\nhttps://www.aclu.org/letter/aclu-endorses-hr-3516-social-security-beneficiary-2nd\n\nIt\'s entirely rational to believe some methods of blocking the mentally ill from getting guns are better than others, or that some definitions of mentally ill are valid and some are not. \n\nParticularly in this case, there is a fine line to tread where you don\'t want to further stigmatize mental illness and deter people from seeking treatment. It would seem to me trained mental health professionals could make that decision on a case by case basis, and that such an approach is better than saying "Everyone who visited a therapist loses their constitutional rights"'

'This is the issue, even the ACLU was against it:" Under our representative payee policy, unless direct payment is prohibited, we presume that an adult beneficiary is capable of managing or directing the management of benefits. However, if we have information that the beneficiary has a mental or physical impairment that prevents him or her from managing or directing the management of benefits, we will develop the issue of capability. If a beneficiary has a mental impairment, we will develop the capability issue if there is an indication that the beneficiary may lack the ability to reason properly, is disoriented, has seriously impaired judgment, or is unable to communicate with others."\n\nBasically if you need help filling out SS financial forms it could put you on a list as mentally impaired therefore guns can be taken away.'

"Trump has never faced repercussions for anything he has said or done. It got him elected to the president and now there again, no repercussions.

Whether it\'s all the many things, including a Supreme Court Justice, regulations being cut massively.”\n\nTrump, unlike most new presidents, has failed to win the passage any major legislation in his first six months in office.\n\nAs someone who works in a sporting goods dept and sells ammunition to a horde of trump thumpers, i hear them repeating his statements a lot. Like the fact that he "has done more in 6 months than any other president". \n\nSo what has he actually done? The auto companies were planning to return already, and the economy not being in a recession means more employment already... What has he done other than throw our nation into upheaval? He gave the ignorant, racist, xenophobic idiots a reason to speak up with conviction, which isnt a good thing.'

He can't even care to pretend that that's true. I'm just going to stop here before I start ranting. "
"Arpaio broke the law, Trump had no justifyable reason to pardon him.  Since the president of the USA is the figurehead for the enforcement of the law, he is basically taking action (and sending a message) that establishes that now he, and the people he agrees with are above the law.  Lawful conviction now means nothing, politics are the last word.  This is action by the president, not just words and speech.  He did this, and now it is our duty to react.\n\nNo matter what political preferences you have, you must agree that the president should not unjustifiably pardon criminals, simply because they fall in line with his politics.  This is not the roll of justice.  This is an unreasonable use of power, period.  You may like what happened today, but what if this trend continues, and the rule of law increasingly breaks down, with lawfully convicted criminals being pardoned due to politics?  We will have a king on our hands, and this is not what America is about.  Think what this means 10 years out, 20, 50.  Will we allow ourselves to be ruled by a king?\n\nFreedom isn't free, and if you believe in the rule of law, and the American way, then I urge you to write your congressmen now and ask them to start impeachment proceedings.  This is literally the *only* recourse we have as citizens who believe in the American way.  Do you believe in politics or the rule of law?  Make it known now.

' Now the GOP cannot claim they see no reason to protect Mueller. With this story and the Rosenstien rumor they absolutely have reason to protect Mueller.

This is now the 2nd time we\'ve heard about Trump wanting to fire Mueller and it is now perfectly clear.

'The GOP is going to find themselves in a no-win situation. Trump fires Mueller and it’ll force impeachment.  If Muellers investigation concludes, its almost a guarantee they’ll be enough to warrant impeachment. If they wait too long, the Dems will likely have the House next January and....they’ll proceed with impeachment.\n\nSo, the way I see it, the “best” option for the GOP (note: not the best option for the country) is if they impeach now and hope they don’t have enough support to remove and if / when Dems take control, they’ll try to say they’ve already tried to impeach and use it as an excuse to “move on”. \n\nIn short:  Impeachment seems inevitable.

'For the paywall\n\n> By Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg\n> Updated Jan. 4, 2018 5:34 p.m. ET\n> \n> Publisher Henry Holt & Co. said it is moving up its release of a new book about President Donald Trump’s administration to Friday, amid a backlash from the White House and surging interest in the title.\n> \n> The book, “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House” by Michael Wolff, was originally scheduled to go on sale Jan. 9, but Henry Holt said in a statement that it advanced the release date “due to unprecedented demand.”\n> \n> The book rocketed to No. 1 on the bestseller lists at Amazon.com and BarnesandNoble.com after excerpts surfaced in news reports this week. Several retailers have reported robust preorders.\n> \n> The White House’s swift and intense attacks on the book, which features criticism of the president and his children, has created a sensitive situation for Henry Holt, an imprint of Macmillan, but also could fuel more interest in the book, retailers say. Representatives of several book retailers, including Barnes & Noble Inc . , said earlier Thursday they had received permission from the publisher to sell the book starting Friday.\n> \n> In a letter Thursday, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, Charles Harder, called for Henry Holt to “cease and desist” from publishing the book or any articles or excerpts related to it, saying the book contained “false and/or baseless statements.” Mr. Harder’s letter requested that the publisher confirm in writing by Friday that it will comply with the demands.\n> \n> Henry Holt acknowledged in a statement that it received the letter, but said it plans to proceed with publication because it sees the book “as an extraordinary contribution to our national discourse.” Henry Holt hasn’t disclosed how many copies it is printing.\n> \n> Mr. Wolff, a journalist and columnist known for his writing on media and entertainment, referred a request for comment to his publisher. In a tweet, he wrote, “You can buy it (and read it) tomorrow. Thank you, Mr. President.”\n> \n> Henry Holt is the latest media outlet to experience an attack by the president. Mr. Trump has on many occasions slammed news outlets, especially CNN and the New York Times, over coverage he dislikes—using his Twitter account to accuse them of peddling fake news. Many media outlets, from newspapers to TV news channels, have enjoyed audience gains since Mr. Trump came onto the scene in the 2016 election, as readers and viewers are drawn to controversies surrounding the president.\n> \n> “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House” is an account of the first months of the Trump administration. Steve Bannon. Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist, is quoted criticizing the president’s children.\n> \n> Booksellers say the White House’s harsh response has helped focus attention on the book at a time when political themed titles are performing well. Most recently, top sellers included “Let Trump Be Trump” by former Trump campaign manager Corey R. Lewandowski and David N. Bossie, and “Obama: An Intimate Portrait,” by former White House photographer Pete Souza.\n> \n> “We saw a huge spike in demand yesterday,” said Terry Finley, chief executive of closely held Books-A-Million Inc., the country’s second largest bookstore chain. The demand largely came in the form of preorders on the retailer’s website.\n> \n> Mr. Finley declined to disclose the number of orders, as did Barnes & Noble and Amazon.com Inc.\n> \n> “President Trump’s attack absolutely stirred interest,” Mr. Finley said.\n> \n> On Thursday morning shoppers were coming into Politics & Prose, which operates two stores in Washington, D.C., and asking if the book was on sale, said co-owner Bradley Graham. Others called the store to inquire.\n> \n> “Fortunately our initial order [from the publisher] was substantial,” said Mr. Graham. “These political books land sometimes with huge news impact, like a Bob Woodward book, and that’s what we’re seeing here.”\n> \n> Sallye Leventhal, a buyer for Barnes & Noble, said leaked excerpts of the book have stoked interest. “And I have to say every move from the White House since then has been a publicity dream. It has forced it to the front page. It could be one of the books of the year,” she said.\n> \n> Henry Holt, which also publishes a successful series of history books written by Bill O’Reilly and Martin Dugard, didn’t offer an early copy to the White House, the person familiar with the matter said.\n> \n> Macmillan, which is a unit of Germany’s closely held Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck, also owns such imprints as Flatiron Books.\n> \n> Flatiron last year acquired an upcoming book from James Comey, the former FBI director fired by Mr. Trump. The book, “A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership,” is listed on Macmillan’s website with a May 1 publication date.\n> \n> Mr. Comey will share “his never-before-told experiences from some of the highest-stakes situations of his career in the past two decades of American government, exploring what good, ethical leadership looks like, and how it drives sound decisions,” according to the website.\n> \n> —Sarah Rabil contributed to this article'

"Trump is single handedly ruining decades of good foreign relations. An ally will only take so much rhetoric and attacks before they cease to be a friend.

'This is one of those polls that should be 100%.\n\nIf you\'re a Trump supporter than you believe Trump is innocent, and competent enough to tell the truth under oath and "stick it to all those crybaby libruls".\n\nIf you\'re a critical thinking, objective person, you would like to see Trump attempt to answer Mueller\'s questions without perjuring himself, since he\'s obviously guilty of a lot of things. Spoiler alert: it\'s money laundering, mixed with a dash of attempting to lift Russian sanctions in exchange for Moscow hotel deals, or whatever dumb thing Trump likes. '
"Majorities polled at different time also want better healthcare, to have avoided the tax bill, to protect Mueller, and so on.\n\nThe current government doesn't give two shits about popular sentiment. Vote in their replacements in November."

'Interesting percentage. Many of his supporters must believe that with his stable genius, he can talk through everything with the investigators and clear his name.'
'I love the spillover of trump supporters contributing the extra few percentage points that think he would do well and prove his innocence during the interview. '
'I mean, even those who support him think it would be worth it for entertainment value. '
"100% should think this. He's innocent? Let him testify without fear. He's guilty? Let him testify white anxious and sweaty. Either way the truth will come out. "
"He can't string two or three sentences together without lying. He lies more than any politician(or person) that I have ever met or heard about in my 50 plus years on this planet.\n\nNo way he testifies...if his lawyers do their jobs and convince him to shut up.  If he does testify I hope is is taped....i'll bring the popcorn when aired."

'I just watched Frost/Nixon.\n\nI actually appreciate Nixon, he at least confessed and generally realized he had committed crimes. Trump is straight up Benedict Arnold Traitor category. Nixon would have never done that. Never thought I would compare Nixon favorably to ANYONE'

Shouldn't he just be enforcing laws by default? \n\nedit: here is a line taken from the article. \n\n> The officials indicated they had not received that directive from the president, but that Trump expects them to carry out their intelligence duties, including getting ahead of threats from Russia and others.\n\nThis isn't news. I do think there is something to this Trump/Russia connection. The people Trump has associated with and their pasts and his past and things like not enforcing bipartisan sanctions etc all make me think that the concern is legitimate, but that doesn't mean that *literally everything* is part of the connection.

"Can you imagine how fast Trump's tune would change if Russia suddenly started supporting, say, the more leftist side of the Democratic party? I know Russia has no incentive to do so, but it would sure be hilarious for Russian meddling to suddenly become an issue for Republicans."
"I don't believe there is ever any way Trump will acknowledge the truth of Russian election meddling. Either explicitly or implictly, by even supporting actions to stop or investigate meddling. There are 2 reasons, one probable and one for certain:\n\n1) Trump is compromised and otherwise beholden to Russia. This is probable due to his record of financial dealings in Russia, his numerous shady connections and obfuscation. \n\n2) Trump is obscenely prideful and self-worshipping. By even simply admitting that Russia may have had, or will have in the future, any positive influence on his winning an election, he would be admitting that he needed and received help and did not win the election on his own merit. This is completely contradictory to his mental projection of his persona so cannot exist."

That’s it.\n\nWe *should* have a law that makes Presidential candidates meet other basic qualifications. I don’t want “average Joe” to be President. I want someone who can (at a minimum) pass the US citizenship test with flying colors, who knows the US Constitution well enough to cite entire portions verbatim, and I want them to open up their tax records, criminal records, and health records for thorough review.\n\nWhen I enlisted, I went through extensive medical review. They checked my weight, they tested my blood, and while stripped naked I had to walk around a room to demonstrate good mobility. I had to “turn my head and cough” and I had to spread my ass cheeks open and show my “brow eyed girl” to some crusty old doctor. That’s just the medical stuff. They went through school and police records as well. And I also had to take and pass a timed multi-aptitude test.\n\nAnd why not? I had chosen a dangerous job where other people’s lives counted on my abilities. I have little doubt that these standards save lives. And that’s the standard we all had to meet to serve in the military. Meanwhile, the President of the United States (arguably the most important job in the world) can be almost anyone under existing laws. We need to fix this.

They’re aimed at three groups Clinton needs to win overwhelmingly: idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans.\n\n-\n\n>In San Antonio, a young staffer showed off a South Park-style animation he’d created of Clinton delivering the “super predator” line (using audio from her original 1996 sound bite), as cartoon text popped up around her: “Hillary Thinks African Americans are Super Predators.” The animation will be delivered to certain African American voters through Facebook “dark posts”—nonpublic posts whose viewership the campaign controls so that, as Parscale puts it, “only the people we want to see it, see it.” The aim is to depress Clinton’s vote total. “We know because we’ve modeled this,” says the official. “It will dramatically affect her ability to turn these people out.”\n\n-\n\n>Regardless of whether this works or backfires, setting back GOP efforts to attract women and minorities even further, Trump won’t come away from the presidential election empty-handed. Although his operation lags previous campaigns in many areas (its ground game, television ad buys, money raised from large donors), it’s excelled at one thing: building an audience. Powered by Project Alamo and data supplied by the RNC and Cambridge Analytica, his team is spending $70 million a month, much of it to cultivate a universe of millions of fervent Trump supporters, many of them reached through Facebook. By Election Day, the campaign expects to have captured 12 million to 14 million e-mail addresses and contact information (including credit card numbers) for 2.5 million small-dollar donors, who together will have ponied up almost $275 million. “I wouldn’t have come aboard, even for Trump, if I hadn’t known they were building this massive Facebook and data engine,” says Bannon. **“Facebook is what propelled Breitbart to a massive audience. We know its power.”**\n\n-\n\n>Whatever Trump decides, this group will influence Republican politics going forward. These voters, whom Cambridge Analytica has categorized as “disenfranchised new Republicans,” are younger, more populist and rural—and also angry, active, and fiercely loyal to Trump. Capturing their loyalty was the campaign’s goal all along. It’s why, even if Trump loses, his team thinks it’s smarter than political professionals. “We knew how valuable this would be from the outset,” says Parscale. **“We own the future of the Republican Party.”**'

'I\'d love to see some New Year\'s indictments, but it doesn\'t seem like that\'s in the cards just yet.\n\n----\n\n>Special counsel Robert Mueller has begun to question Republican National Committee staffers about the party\'s 2016 campaign data operation, which helped President Donald Trump\'s campaign team target voters in critical swing states.\n\n>Two sources told\xa0[Yahoo News](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mueller-probe-outgrows-witch-hunt-phase-100045988.html)\xa0that Mueller\'s team is examining whether the joint RNC-Trump campaign data operation - which was directed on Trump\'s side by Brad Parscale and managed by Trump\'s son-in-law Jared Kushner - "was\xa0related to the activities of Russian trolls and bots aimed at influencing the American electorate."\n\n>....\n\n>It is not surprising that federal investigators have begun to examine the possibility that Russia and the Trump campaign helped each other during the election. Investigators have been looking into whether Russia provided the campaign\xa0with voter information stolen by Russian hackers\xa0from election databases in several states, and whether the Trump campaign helped Russia target its political ads to specific demographics and voting precincts.\n\n>The general counsels for Facebook, Twitter, and Google\xa0gave enigmatic replies\xa0when asked by the House Intelligence Committee last month whether they had investigated "who was mimicking who" when it came to online ads promoted by both the Trump campaign and Russia during the election.\n\n>Facebook said in September that\xa0about 25% of the ads purchased\xa0by Russians during the election "were geographically targeted," though many analysts have said they find it difficult to believe that foreign entities would have had the kind of granular knowledge of American politics necessary to target specific demographics and voting precincts.\n\n>...\n\n>Investigators have long wondered whether the data-mining and analysis firm Cambridge Analytica served as a link between the campaign\'s data operation and Russia.\nThat scrutiny intensified following revelations that Cambridge CEO Alexander Nix reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in June 2016 asking for access to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\'s "stolen" emails.\n\n>It is still unclear how much Cambridge Analytica actually did for the campaign. Trump campaign aides and even current and former Cambridge employees\xa0have consistently tried to downplay its role.\n\n>Parscale was asked about Cambridge during his interview with the House Intelligence Committee in October.\xa0The ranking members of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees sent him a separate letter that month asking whether his firm received "information from a foreign government or foreign actor" at any point during the election.\n\n>The letter was also sent to Nix and the heads of Deep Root Analytics, TargetPoint Consulting, and The Data Trust - firms hired by the Republican National Committee last year to bolster the Trump campaign\'s data operation.\n\n>...\n\n>Whereas Deep Root, TargetPoint, and The Data Trust responded to the documents request, Nix did not.\n\n>Parscale\'s letter, meanwhile, mirrored those written by the RNC data firms and used virtually the same language - with one notable exception.\n\n>Whereas the firms\' letters included a line denying that they had had contact with any "foreign government or foreign actor," Parscale\'s did not.\n\n\n\n\n'
">The report indicates that Mueller may be homing in on yet another facet of Russia's election interference — its social media influence campaign and **targeted political advertising**.\n\nThis is tied to money laundering.\n\nPour the foreign money into US-based advertising companies, then direct the ad companies spend the foreign money running ads compelling US citizens to send *domestic* money to the candidate's pet PAC. It's trading dirty money for clean money at one of the better laundering rates on the planet, but relies on nobody looking into it since the dirty money has to be snuck in somewhere, and money *always* leaves a trail (for now).\n\nNot everyone has to be in on it either. While I'm no expert on the case, the way it looks to be shaking out is that Manafort brought most/all of the money, so it's plausible that the ad agencies were getting legit checks to do legal work. Or maybe the ad agencies were in on it and the money was coming directly from foreign banks/buyers, but they weren't telling Facebook/Google/Twitter where their money was coming from. Or maybe Facebook/Google/Twitter knew - or even received foreign money directly - but they definitely weren't telling the voter that the paid-for ad to send money to Trump was bought with Putin cash as a vehicle to move clean US dollars directly to Trump (and future interests too, those legal PACs are still loaded and ready to spend in 2018).\n\nIt's basically a SarahPAC Shuffle, but instead of the candidate and their family building the vehicle to live like trash off dumb-as-rocks US citizen donations for the rest of their lives, in Trump's case the seed money came courtesy of Vladimir and the goals are a lot more lofty than being able to afford the good meth."
"2018 only saves us if Democrats absolutely trounce Republicans in the popular vote. The Republicans have gerrymandered so many House districts to such a degree it's quite literally possible for the Democrats to win the popular vote by as much as 10% and still find themselves in the minority.\n\nNOBODY can afford to sit this one out.\nIf you have the time and resources to, and have EVER considered volunteering for a campaign... the country needs you desperately.\n\nHeck, if you are qualified to run for office and have any desire to do so...  \nPLEASE run for office to help preserve our American political tradition.  \nThere is still more than enough time in virtually every state and it really is true that every single political office counts for something and needs to be contested.  \nEven if you are in a place where your party tends to get trounced things are far from hopeless.  You would be surprised how much running a great campaign can overcome partisan politics, particularly locally.  \nAnd quite frankly, you never know if your opponent is going to turn out to be the next Roy Moore.  \nNearly every cycle some House candidate blows an easy re-election due to scandal.\n\nHere is a website for an organisation dedicated to helping new candidates...  https://www.runforsomething.net/\n\nAnd this page provides links to the website for each state's Secretary of State...  links to register as a candidate will typically be contained somewhere on these sites... https://www.thebalance.com/secretary-of-state-websites-1201005\n\nNow the Senate will require the near equivalent of a no-hitter... there are at least four or five winnable Senate seats without requiring a Roy Moore situation, but only two of them are realistic in anything except an inverse 2010 type wave election.\n\nCombine their gerrymandering, regularly ignoring FOIA requests, avoiding constituents, trying to discredit American law and intelligence agencies, pushing judge nominees with zero experience and now calls to 'purge' the FBI and CIA... it's becoming very obvious that there is a large faction within the Republican Party that has no respect at all for American political traditions and it's enlightenment-based founding principles but intend on doing whatever is needed to gain total and permanent control of the levers-of-state regardless of law or public sentiment.\n\nFor those who I heard for years claim that politics was all theater and the person in the White House was irrelevant to the course of American policymaking... there is a damn good reason certain folks were very happy to support that notion. And those people don't want folks who genuinely question everything voting.\n\nThose people now control the entire federal government, in large part thanks to millions of you sitting out every time an election came along... but now we have an opportunity to put things right.\n\nGet angry, get loud... and most importantly of all, get out there and do whatever we can to restore genuine law and order to our country.\n\n"

"It may be just me, but when a highly resoected former top level British spy puts something into a dossier that hes being paid a lot of money to research its pretty safe to assume he actually did his homework didn't just trust the rumors he was hearing.

"I've been feeling pretty disgusted lately with the prospect of another year of Trump. But, Mueller news is reassuring. So long as he continues to work, I can continue to be patient.\n\nMueller Time is never late, nor is it early. It arrives precisely when Mueller means it to."
"At this point, if you're still a republican then you deserve less respect than I give my dog, considering you are less intelligent than him.  "
"All these reports make it sound as though Mueller is a Terminator-like robot who was designed specifically to investigate federal crimes and dish out indictments.  \n\nI really hope he's as ruthlessly efficient as all these claims say.  Considering how it only took him less than 1 year to indict Manafort and Gates, as well as get guilty pleas from Papadapoulos and Flynn, I guess he and his team are deserving of their reputation."
'I would love to be questioned by Mueller, would be the proudest day of my life.  But then I’ve never committed crimes so I have nothing to fear.'
'if the investigation continues to the end...we are all going to be very surprised by how much the GOP has gotten in bed with Russia ( well, some will be surprised, the rest will be "ha! told you so!")'
"To me this is the thing that could most easily bring down Trump if it's true because it's so data based. It's simple: if Russia's targeting matches CA's data, it's game over, and this is something that should be very knowable. The key thing then becomes who gave it to them. "
'If the whole top of the party was in on the collusion, it explains neatly why everyone is ready to fall on their swords for him.'
'hmm, iirc it was later confirmed for every single thing that sources in the past told the press about the Mueller operation, that it was already weeks old at that point.  \nDoes that mean that this is already weeks old, too?

"Oooooh, and the Mercers! I'd love to see *them* in bright orange and handcuffs. "
"The truly greatest move Mueller could make is demoloshing the GOP. Going after Trump would just be treating a symptom (a very bad one) and not fixing the cause. \n\nIf Mueller deals a serious blow by mid next year and the legislative branch can swing to democratic control, rule of law would be reestablished and Trump wouldn't be able to hide behind the protection of an obstructionist congress. The rest of the convicts in the Republican party would also be rooted out. What's risked by axing Trump is that the GOP can jump on that bandwagon and throw him under the bus to take all the heat for them and the reason why someone like Trump came into power would still exist. "
"Jared's gonna take the fall for all of this and Trump get off scot free. that is what I am worried about (even though I am sure Jared deserves it, I just don't want Trump to squirm his way out of it). The idea Trump wouldn't have known about any of these dealings with Russians is just unbelievable. "
"I remember before and during the primaries--the establishment Republicans were supporting basically anyone *but* Trump, until all others were knocked out of primary contention. I wonder what happened behind closed doors at the RNC. Did they have a hand in moving the primaries toward Trump? Or did they learn about--and accept--the election meddling strategy only after Trump made his way to the nomination? Either way, things don't look good for them."
'> You’re up there, you’ve got half the room going totally crazy wild, they loved everything, they want to do something great for our country," Trump said. "And you have the other side even on positive news, really positive news like that, they were like death and un-American. Un-American. Somebody said treasonous. I mean, yeah, I guess, why not. Can we call that treason? Why not.\n\nHe\'s calling the Democrats treasonous because they didn\'t clap for him as much as Republicans at the State of the Union Address.\n\nThis is dangerous, short-sighted rhetoric. Also worth noting how he equates support for Donald Trump with support for America. That\'s how fascists operate.'
"Wasn't he going to bring both parties together? Wasn't that his SOTU schtick? He's doing a great job of that."
'THIS IS NOT FUCKING NORMAL!!\n\nThis guy is a wannabe dictator. All it takes is for the GOP to grant him his powers and judging by what has transpired over the last several weeks, they will gladly bend over for Trump.'
'This makes me really miss President Obama.  For all the shit he got, he never called his opponents un-American.  Even when someone yelled during his SOTU.\n\nI mean, it is pretty astonishing how far the office of president has fallen in terms of grace and class in general.'
'I really love how subtle and nuanced our president is. '
'Ah, yes, nothing says freedom and democracy like a President accusing the other party, and by association those that voted for them, as un-American and treasonous.\n\nIt was good while it lasted America. Remember all the good times.'

Two of these sources, however, cautioned that the evidence is not conclusive.**\n\n-\n\ndoing the math: 3 sources all said the same thing... but two cautioning that evidence isn't conclusive... what did the 3rd guy say about the evidence?\n\nby the way, today's monday - i can't help but wonder what we'll know by friday!"

'I\'m guessing the Trump Supporter Version of this story goes something like: "See, I told you *Obummer* was wiretapping Trump!!!"\n\ne: yup.\n\nMore broadly, rip Manafort.'
'I really really really hope that they caught trump on the wire. I know that goes without saying but I need some positive movement and news on the whole Russia investigation.'
"Didn't this sub jack each other off to the fact Trump said his campaign was wiretapped?\n\nIt looks like we had a Democratic President using his office to instruct intelligence agencies to engage in opposition research against political opponents."
"IT's funny that the Trump supporters feel vindicated because a court found probable cause to believe Manafort committed a fucking crime worthy of wiretapping."
'You know this is an awesome story when you check the comments at 2am and the thread is TOTALLY full of people claiming this exonerates Trump. You know, at 9am russian time, when they all come online. '
'Kinda funny how the pedes all seem to be following the format of "wait, so Trump was right?" and then they all conveniently know that Manafort "lived there since 2006." Like that\'s some fucking common fact that everyone has readily available. '
"Somehow Trump idiots at /r/The_dumbasses are spinning this and trying to make it seem like Trump was right about being wiretapped (hint: he isn't) while completely ignoring what this actually means.\n\nThe delusion is actually scary."
'ITT: right wingers happy that the FBI has probable cause to secure a court order to spy on Manafort. '
'The fact that Trump is allowed to have the nuclear codes while CLEARLY going senile with dementia just shows how much of a joke the US has become.'

Yes, [THAT Chertoff.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chertoff)\n\nYou can't say you wasted 40 years of your life when 40 years of your life was spent building what Trump is."
"I am honestly shocked to see r/politics supporting this piece of shit.\n\nHayden is the conduet through which the survielance state has flowed.\n\nEverything wrong with the lack of privacy today is because of this man. He essentially threw himself upon the sword of principle in order to allow Cheney and friends to establish a nightmare system that COULD have incorporated privacy features but were removed because of Hayden and his lackeys.\n\nFuck you Hayden. I sincerely encourage people to research what this man did. He's a traitor to this country.\n\nAnd fuck Trump too."
'Not murdering millions of people for your profit? '
'If only more people would actually use the word lie like this guy. Enough is enough- the pivot never came, the office never sobered him.  He has to fucking go, our society simply can not function like this.'
'The President gives moral authority to what the military does.  \nIt\'s why we\'ve enshrined Civilian Supremacy over the military into The Constitution.  \nHis consent to action is supposed to represents the collective approval of a grateful nation.  \n  \nHaving a man like Trump without a clear code of Honor directing the military takes away that moral authority.  \n  \nIt\'s such a small thing but it\'s the difference between a man serving his fellow citizens and man with a gun collecting a paycheck.  \n  \nTrump is leveraging the military\'s honor like equity in one of his golf courses.  \nSoon he\'s going to ask them to do something atrocious.  Without  that moral authority they won\'t be able to come home and hear "Thank you for your service" without it sounding sarcastic.    \n  \nBecause the president isn\'t a honest or humble man with a clear code of honor he can not understand what an insult to honor would be.  \nHe shames us all.\n  \n'
'Trump will tweet tomorrow, "Only 4 stars? Who cares? General George Washington has 2 more stars than this guy and he never said anything bad about Donald Trump."'
"I respect Hayden. I don't agree with a lot that he did, but I think he's an honorable man who did what he thought was right.\n\nI'm glad Hayden is speaking out against Trump in this way, and I hope that it helps him achieve a more understanding attitude towards Edward Snowden, who also did what he thought was right when faced with an out of control administration abusing its authority."
'well, his lies are celebrated by a large number of people and ignored by a larger number of people.\n\nso, if anything you did was with the hope that thinking people would see thru something like this guy then yes, you did waste that time.'
'Its become all about how much money I make, how much power I can have. The idea of country, family, enjoyment of life has been forgotten. Trump represents the extreme of this and I hope people remember the unending avarice these people in our government have now and how they only represent corporations.'
">“I wish I could say that I thought it wasn’t a socioeconomic caste system, but it absolutely is,” Richards told Newsweek. “These Puerto Ricans are being treated like they are disposable. It's been inhumane.”\n\nWelcome to America. The reality is apparent whether its within the justice system or daily interaction people--socioeconomic factors dictate how you're treated. You're given higher sentence because you're unable to afford a lawyer. You're unable to obtain the best available education because you grew up poor without the human capital needed to navigate throughout the education system or office politics. You're ignored when entering high end departments like Neiman Marcus because of your cloths and demeanor. \n\nPR's voting power isn't as high or valued to Trump for him to bother investing ample money into. Unlike his rallies POST election and presidency. It's beyond telling what he thinks of poor people that are not his voting base. "
"Who cares? They're brown. Right, Trump supporters? If you ever supported Trump, you're terribly gullible. If you are still supporting him, you are absolutely disgusting."

'"Donald Trump hates brown people"\n\nNewsweek used to be a proud and vibrant periodical that is now reduced to tabloid clickbate like this?\n\nThe similarities between New Orleans and Puerto Rico are staggering.  '
"Very first sentence of this article:\n\n>An elderly woman in Puerto Rico is helpless as her husband's body becomes a patchwork of ulcers and sores from Parkinson's disease.\n\nThe USNS Comfort is anchored off the coast of Puerto Rico as we speak is it not?  Why hasn't this man, and the many others like him, been airlifted to it yet?\n\nAlso:\n\n>Water bottles are guarded by FEMA officials and local police to prevent raiding. Officials distribute five bottles of water per person each week to ration the resources. The nurses in Puerto Rico are collecting donations to buy food and water to deliver to rural communities without access to the city.\n\nSo are you telling me that FEMA only has what normally would be one day's worth of food and water per person to be rationed out over a week and from there they have to find a way to buy the rest?  From whom are these supplemental relief supplies being purchased from anyway?  Does this have anything to do with the Jones Act?   "

'LOL no wonder he withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement'
"I think you'll find that he doesn't know the difference between *a great many things*"

'This article just gets the ball rolling. Look at what else was published today.\n\nhttp://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2017/08/16/president-white-supremacist-just-enabler/AkCvA0oOP1kxGZDkvMFTQL/story.html\n>Trump “has a racist point of view of the world. He has demonstrated resentment for every group except white men over the years,” said Trump biographer Michael D’Antonio, who spent long hours with the president, his advisers, and his family in preparation for his 2015 book, “The Truth about Trump.”\n\n>He once suggested a season of his NBC show, “The Apprentice,” be set up so white contestants would square off against blacks.\n\n>“Whether people like that idea or not, it is somewhat reflective of our very vicious world,” Trump said in 2005, according to an article that appeared on the NBC’s “Today” show’s website.\n\n>D’Antonio, the Trump biographer who chronicled the real estate mogul’s rise into business and politics, contends that the president’s connection to white supremacy is deep.\n\n>D’Antonio pointed to Trump’s statements concerning his supposed genetic superiority over the years, including public statements over the years he’s a “gene believer” and that he has “great genes.”\n\n>The biographer said Trump, and his son, Donald Trump Jr., personally told him that the family believes that there are gradations of genetically superior and inferior people, a bedrock principle of those who subscribe to white supremacist ideology.\n\n>Trump has also cited the exceptional genes of his late uncle, an MIT professor named John G. Trump.\n\n>“I had an uncle went to MIT who is a top professor. Dr. John Trump. A genius,” Trump said in an interview with CNN. “It’s in my blood. I’m smart. Great marks. Like really smart.”\n\nEdit:\n\nWhoa, here come the comments from white supremacists!'
'Just as an FYI to those that are bashing Foreign Policy, it is a highly respected and bipartisan journal.

'LMAO this sub is a fucking joke. '
'> "His comments during a press conference on August 15 in which he spontaneously reiterated his support for white supremacist protesters..."\n\nNo, his comments were the exact *opposite* of support.  He condemned white supremacists and neo-Nazis, both.  People have stopped caring about going straight to the source for their information, opting instead for "news" that makes them feel good.  Watch the [press conference](https://youtu.be/alc_x49hLuw) for yourself.  His statements start in the Q&A phase around 6:25.'
"Okay, I get that Trump made a stupid decision not calling out the white supremacists explicitly in his initial statements, but what the press is doing is hyperbolic name-calling and, frankly, it's very disturbing to see them continue to sensationalize racial tensions in this country by painting the President with such an extreme epithet.\n\nI mean, the guy has Jewish grandkids. He explicitly called out the white supremacists (who, mind you, are also provocating with their bullshit message that Trump is showing them any support) and the press sneered at him because to them, this is a fucking game and they know they can win by gripping white-kunckle to his initial statements and continuing to blow them out of proportion.\n\nWe are not the only country in the world, and America is not the center of the universe. All of the free-speech benefits we have in this country, that are being so abused to produce the resurgence of hatred on **both sides**, are being put at risk with the kind of irresponsible behavior being shown by major news networks. This is a Divide and Conquer scheme if I've ever seen it, and if we continue to feed manipulators and provocateurs on both sides of this growing problem, it will only get worse.\n\nI understand that for many people, politics (not /r/politics, although that is applicable too) is a place where passions come to grow. The problem is that it doesn't seem that in this age of echo chambers, our passions aren't *maturing*, they're just becoming larger and larger without any nuance or capacity for understanding developing. They become blunt sledgehammers that people use to beat one another online and, unfortunately, in the press.\n\nIf you cannot agree on that, then you are being played, made into a tool. I don't give a fuck what you think about Trump while typing this, and I hope you can extend me the same courtesy for these few paragraphs.\n\nNow as for his comments, I think it's safe (or should be) to say that the casual condoning of anti-white sentiments by mainstream news sources, as well as the pervasiveness of identity politics in almost every organized media source, has led to a resurgence of white identity politics on the opposing end. By blaming white people as a homogeneous whole for the misdeeds of the major civilizations past, as well as our country today, those who do not have the capacity to identify such sentiments for the poisonous filth they are feel compelled to play the same game.\n\nWe're losing a hold on the individualism that used to be the shining achievement of liberal politics. Instead, our media has become obsessed with treating groups of people born with a specific trait as sharing responsibility for the actions of others with that trait. Frankly, it's a twisted form of racism that, much like the white supremacists, claims moral superiority as its defense.\n\nThe fact is, right now it's just white and black, but they can keep fractionating these groups indefinitely until the idea that the government needs to control everything to make things fair is the only common thread of opinion. It seems to me, as much as I wish it didn't, to be a power play, and it seems to be working.\n\nI hope that the sensationalism of the mainstream extends to this problem too--and the many who seem to buy into such heinous claims with glee--are a vocal minority, but it's ineffectual to rely on hope.\n\nThere is greater variance in intelligence and personality *within identity groups* then there is *between them*. We need to realize that the fractionating of identities into smaller and smaller groups is progressing inexorably towards the truth--that we are individuals, that an infinite number of things distinguish us from one another. We need to treat each other as individuals, with good will, and hopefully we can come out on the other side of this without letting these reflex-testing knee-jerkers truly set this country on fire just so they have their window to seize control.\n\nIt's only by realizing our individuality that we can perceive the true merit of our unity. There are other forces in this world besides the U.S. that make Trump look like a funny grandpa, and they are waiting to take over if we cannot hold together, by crooked insurgency or otherwise.\n\nTL;DR: We're getting played (on both sides) by identity politics and it's tearing us apart. Don't let it happen because it makes you feel good in the moment. We need to remember that we are individuals first and foremost and that the respect that entails can unite us if we think clearly and don't let our passions be used as the weapons of our domination."
"Seeing some of the comments here, it's clear that djt is actually very effective at gas lighting his base. They honestly think this is a gross exaggeration. "
"Trump is not a Nazi sympathizer.  The people writing these articles and the people perpetuating this nonsense should be absolutely ashamed of themselves.  You are nothing but sore losers.  Trump goes out there and condemns the actions of both groups involved in Charlottesville and the media still finds a way to bash him.  I have really given up hope for our youth today.  The same people claiming he is a Nazi sympathizer are probably Bernie supporters yet they don't realize communism is just as bad as Nazism.  Trump is doing a GREAT job and is here to stay for the rest of the term regardless of what some idiots at CNN or Russia conspiracy whackjobs have to say."
"Utter fucking garbage.  I don't think I've voted for a Republican in my life but if we keep heading this direction it won't be long until I do.\n\nThe left is surrendering to its extremists just like the right did with the Tea Party.  Its clear that the energy of Hate is much more powerful than any traditional associations or any conceivable attempts at cooperation.  And because both parties are led by power-hungry, self-absorbed clowns they'll continue to prioritize power over the country every time."
'I dislike trump quite a bit, but this is getting out of hand. Surely other things are going on'
"I would advance this as well, the Republican Senators and Congressmen have to stop everything and demand that Trump step down as their man, the one they nominated and the one they promoted to the top job in this country. As long as Trump is the leader of the Republican party, they are still the guys who are supporting him and allowing him to keep this position. It is not enough to wring their hands and say he needs to say something different. They have to take a stand, admit their mistake, and take the lead by demanding he step down or start impeachment.\n\nAs long as Trump is leading the Republican party, the party is synonymous with Trump. Either he is your leader or he is not. Which is it? We can not have this kind of leadership in this country and if you tolerate or support it, you are also the problem. Trump is on the way out. All that remains to be seen is who is still loyal to the traitor and who is not. We, the people, will make the needed adjustments at every upcoming election. You may think this will wash over but that would be a huge mistake. \n\nThe right is making a lot of noise and Trump's base is as loyal as ever and you may think you can whether this without taking a hard line stand. Go ahead and try it, just know that the Trump ship will in fact sink. \n\nAre you with Trump or the American people? You are forced to make that choice. There is no middle ground in any of this."
'He has got to go!\n\nI will bet that the Republican Party is contemplating his removal.\n\nIf he does not destroy all of us he will certainly destroy the GOP.'
"It really is *not* unprecedented for one to be a Nazi sympathizer and an agent for Russian interests at the same time. For example many American Communists actively supported Germany during that brief time when Germany & Russia had a mutual nonaggression pact at the start of WWII.\n\nMany Russian nationalists today have had very positive things to say about Neo-Naziism.\n\nThese are not at all the strange bedfellows they would seem on the surface, very simpatico in many ways. (Now to be sure I'm talking about *Putin's* Russia and not meaning to malign Russians in an ongoing sense)."

'I have to think that the drastic camera shake a few seconds after the point where he says "met with the president of the Virgin Islands" is due to the cameraman chuckling to himself.  It was perfectly still until then.'

"> Trump: If Dems win in 2018 midterms, they'll impeach me\n\nThank you for encouraging the Democratic vote, dude!"
'I sure hope so. After the investigation is over of course.'
"If the Dems win the mid-terms, they still won't have enough votes in the Senate to convict Trump if he's impeached by the House.  The Democrats aren't going to impeach Trump only to watch him acquitted.  So, no, the Democrats aren't going to impeach Trump if they win the mid-terms in November."
"that's the smartest thing ive ever heard him say!"
"He won't be impeached, nor will he resign. He will make it through the rest of his term and probably not run again in 2020. \n\nDems need to stop focusing on getting him removed, because it will just cause a larger headache and more problems than it will solve. It will also just serve to further alienate his base and deny themselves votes from people who are not die-hard Trump suppoerters. \n\nWhat dems need to focus on is campaigning on issues that actually affect middle class and low-income families, rather than trying to win points with their constituents by playing Trump's game of political theatre. If they can develop a unified, genuine, and coherent message and garner more votes from people on the moderate portion of the political spectrum, I can see them winning a lot of seats. But they need to remember that they are running to represent the will of their constituents, NOT their party. \n\nI don't think they'll be able to do that, but that would be my strategy. Regardless, I think they'll do quite well in November. "

I really don\'t care anymore if I\'m labeled hyperbolic, or if comparing this situation to 1930\'s Germany is offensive, or if Trump will or will not go to the similar extremes because it is abundantly clear that he will make his own extremes. Hitler consolidated most of his power fairly rapidly within a 2 month time span. Germans who were aware were still caught off guard.\n\nWe can\'t repeat that mistake. I sincerely hope I\'m wrong and will gladly eat crow if so, but this is just (to date) the most egregious red flag in what is now a long list. We all thought Trump could never actually become President, that he wouldn\'t actually do X, Y, and Z, that every insane offense would finally be the nail in his coffin, but each and every time it happens and each and every time he gets away with it. I\'m 100&#37; convinced of his desire, the only thing up in the air now is what exactly he does and if he gets away with it.

'Its really sad that all it would have taken to avoid all this nonsense is for the DNC to actually listen to the will of the people, and and go with the popular candidate rather then the one they knew was loyal to them.

Guaranteed the peoples candidate would have won and none of this would be going down if they had just listened.\n\nThe RNC and DNC are no longer representing America.

"I'm honestly not at all surprised. I grew up with Trump as a NYer, with his tacky use of gold right there on 5th Ave, and I knew of it since I was a child. There was never an association of Trump with actual class or wealth, rather, he seemed to be a glorified car salesman-type of person. He never launched an industry or a company I remotely cared about. Locally, there was always some sort of shenanigans taking place with him, from being on the Howard Stern show to the Miss America/Universe pageants.\n\n\nNow he's here, from one con to another, and it seems as though he's the master con-man. As a NYer, I'm ashamed no one listened to us, who knew him much better (excluding his family and some russians) than his hardcore voter base and those who sided with him. Somehow they saw success... and I don't get it. In NYC, there's successful people everywhere, and some people, you can just feel the money coming from their pores.\n\nTrump was never one of them.

More than that, it\'s supposed to be run by the people, and his government is like an exclusive club for the rich and powerful.'
'He wants to see how much he can pad his pockets before he is out. If he makes it four years the better for him. I think the campaign itself was a way to use the loopholes for his own gain.

While the administration keeps coming out with what they consider "damning evidence of Saddam possessing WMD\'s", UN Weapons inspector Hans Blix kept coming back with report, after report, after report of on site inspections of nothing to prove. Another case of the GOP calling "fake things true, and true things fake".\n\nI find it odd that abortion opponents often are in opposition to things that provably decrease the rate of abortion, such as giving women who are at risk of having an unwanted pregnancy things like IUD\'s, and birth control, while supporting measures that would assuredly increase the need for abortion, such as giving teenagers really shitty "abstinence only sex education", or trying to make access to birth control out of reach for whole swath\'s of citizens.'

"It's not just the GOP. The Nazi party did this to gain power in Germany and then Europe. Stalin did it in Russia. Putin still does it in Russia. Sadam Hussein did it in Iraq. Bashar al-Assad does this in Syria, and Gaddafi did it in Libya. Same way Kim Jong-un communicates to North Koreans. See a trend? "
'The GOP used to be about cutting taxes and deregulation. Now it seems like all they care about is catering to Wall Street. They really need to hit the reset button and get back to their core values. Same with the dems, who are so wrapped up in identity politics.'

"I like the last paragraph for being perfectly frank about the matter: \n\n>as a general matter people frequently correct testimony they’ve made before Congress when they realize that something they said was not accurate.

'This never-ending cascade of traitorous subversion and corruption is mind boggling.

Honestly, a deeper sense of helplessness settles over me. You\'re not going to see Jared, or Ivanka, or Trump in jail.

'>Three days after Donald Trump named his campaign foreign policy team in March 2016, the youngest of the new advisers sent an email to seven campaign officials with the subject line: “Meeting with Russian Leadership - Including Putin.”\n\n>The adviser, George Papadopoulos, offered to set up “a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to discuss US-Russia ties under President Trump,” telling them his Russian contacts welcomed the opportunity, according to internal campaign emails read to The Washington Post.\n\nSeems legit.'
"Mueller isn't struggling to get evidence.  He's struggling to not empty out the entire administration when the indictments are read.   The only people left will be Mattis, McMaster, and the chef. "
'>Papadopoulos, a campaign volunteer with scant foreign policy experience, persisted. Between March and September, the self-described energy consultant **sent at least a half-dozen requests for Trump, as he turned from primary candidate to party nominee, or for members of his team to meet with Russian officials**.\n\n-\n\n>Less than a decade out of college, Papadopoulos appeared to hold little sway within the campaign, and it is unclear whether he was acting as an intermediary for the Russian government, **although he told campaign officials he was**.\n\n-\n\n>Undeterred, Papadopoulos alerted then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski in an April email tht **he was receiving “a lot of calls over the past month” about arranging a Russia meeting.**\n\n>**“Putin wants to host the Trump team when the time is right,”** he wrote on April 27.\n\n-\n\n>On May 4, Papadopoulos forwarded Lewandowski and others a note he received from the program head for the government-funded **Russian International Affairs Council**. In it, Ivan Timofeev, a senior official in the organization, reached out to report that Russian foreign ministry officials were open to a Trump visit to Moscow and requested that the campaign and Russians write a formal letter outlining the meeting.\n\n-\n\n>The Russian International Affairs Council was created in 2010 by a decree of then-President Dmitry Medvedev as a project of various Russian government agencies. It is led by former foreign minister Igor Ivanov. Its board includes Russia’s current foreign minister, **Sergei Lavrov**, as well as top Russian scholars and business leaders, among them the chairman of **Alfa-Bank** and **Sberbank**, two of Russia’s largest banks.'

This makes it look like there was a coordinated effort to distance DJT from these meetings on the campaign's end. After all, Manafort did end up meeting with Russian interests as part of the campaign."

'This seems like a weird turn. Like they created an opportunity to have a record of themselves denying foreign help'
"This article actually runs somewhat contrary to the evidence thus far that Trump's campaign staff were either actively seeking some form of collusion or were too naive to know that crossed a hard line. This is the story of a junior campaign staffer who pushed them to meet with Putin and the higher ups telling him that wouldn't be appropriate. \n\nNow that runs somewhat contrary to what we know about the senior campaign staff's willingness to meet with Russian agents, so this is odd overall. A trusting person might say: they clearly had an ethical boundary in place in terms of talking to Russia outside of appropriate channels. A cynic might say: this staffer was an idiot, they didn't fall for this particular easy bait and this story gives them political cover. "

Campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis wrote that he thought NATO allies should be consulted before any plans were made. Another Trump adviser, retired Navy Rear Adm. Charles Kubic, cited legal concerns, including a possible violation of U.S. sanctions against Russia and of the Logan Act, which prohibits U.S. citizens from unauthorized negotiation with foreign governments.\n\n>...\n\n> The exchanges are among more than 20,000 pages of documents the Trump campaign turned over to congressional committees this month after review by White House and defense lawyers. The selection of Papadopoulos’s emails were read to The Post by a person with access to them. Two other people with access to the emails confirmed the general tone of the exchanges and some specific passages within them.\n\nSo, is Papadopoulos going to be another one of Trump\'s "I barely knew him. He wasn\'t important." advisors? Because we know how he\'s tried to distance himself from Manafort too. I don\'t doubt that even if Trump had no knowledge of Papadopoulos\' actions, he\'s actively engaged in covering it up. '

'"WV"... West Virgina. Here\'s a little background re: the governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice. This is the guy who switched to (D) in 2015 to run for governor then recently announced he\'s switching back to (R) at a Trump rally. More info:\n\n>Most noteworthy perhaps is his investment in Bluestone mines which he sold to Russian mining company Mechel OAO in a cash and stock deal in 2009 for $550 million, only to buy it back in 2015 for just $5 million.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maxjedeurpalmgren/2017/08/04/billionaire-and-wv-governor-jim-justice-switches-to-republican-at-trump-event/&refURL=https://www.google.com/&referrer=https://www.google.com/ \n\nEDIT: since this post has way too many upvotes, here\'s a link to Mechel\'s press release following the sale shared by another redditor: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6vr8zv/z/dm2oasy\n\nIn addition to the $5 million payment, Justice agreed to pay royalties of $3.00 per ton on coal mined while Mechel owned Bluestone. Don\'t know what that number comes out to, but I\'ve got to assume it\'s not near $500 million. Also, if Justice sells Bluestone within the next 10 years, Mechel gets 10-12% of that sale price.\n\nSome people seem to think this additional context makes this less shady, but I\'m not really seeing it. Mechel invested half a billion dollars in a dying/deadass industry in 2009, ate all the operating losses over the next several years, then sold the company back to the previous owner for a relative pittance. If it\'s not shady, it\'s monumentally stupid.'

That is an ENTIRELY different scenario. Sure this speech is incredibly alarming but be wary of propagating the Hitler/Hitler Youth narrative. Not only is at an exaggeration it is also a narrative that the right-wing will use to discredit opposition to this Speech. \n\nFor reference, the rhetoric Hitler used looked like this, \n\n"Whatever we create today, whatever we do, we will die, but Germany will live on in you.  When there is nothing left of us, then you must hold in your fists the flags that we hoisted out of nothing.  I know this cannot be otherwise because you are the flesh of our flesh, and the blood of our blood.  In your young heads burns the same spirit that rules us.  You cannot be other than united with us.  When the great columns of our movement march triumphantly through Germany today, I know you will join the columns.

The last time was Bill Clinton, in 1998.\n* **No honorees have announced their intention to boycott the event itself**. A number of them have, however, announced they will not attend the reception dinner the night before. Which honestly makes Trump\'s refusing to attend the event even more petty. He\'s pissed they wouldn\'t come to what I\'m sure he sees as "his" dinner.\n\nMore opinion than fact: I think you\'re all reading way too much into the Kennedy Center\'s statement. A plain reading of the statement doesn\'t lead one to conclude they were "throwing shade", and they have no reason to be that political. Trump\'s (admittedly ridiculous) statement was:\n\n> "The president and first lady have decided not to participate in this year’s activities to allow the honorees to celebrate without any political distraction."\n\nIf you take this entirely at face value, then the only proper response is the one the Center provided: "Thank you." In other words, Trump claimed it was for the benefit of the KC and the event, so the KC expressed gratitude for it. And reading the entire statement from the KC makes this interpretation seem even more valid, as the whole thing is basically just a generally gracious sentiment.'
'"The Kennedy Center called me earlier. Really good guys, great guys. They wanted to thank me for all the great decisions I have made, the best decisions." -Trump (probably)'

We are grateful for this gesture," they said.\n '
'Have you ever actually heard someone say, "Thank you so much for *not* coming." But they *weren\'t* being passive aggressive?\n\nThe President of the United States is effectively sitting in the "dunce corner" of Western society.'

"If there is a line in the sand that Trump can't cross, this just might be it.  Republicans hold corporate profits above all else.  Nothing else matters to them.  Witness our national security, our voting rights, our national debt: all of those they were willing to look the other way on.  But tariffs cut right into sales and profits.  I think Trump feels emboldened and he has overstepped himself on how much cover the Republican party is willing to provide. "
'Trying to be civil - it\'s just so hard when referencing the orange man or Fox Entertainment (aka "news.")\n\nRemember when Trump was the only candidate out of the 19 who openly said he\'d abandon the Republican ship and run as either Independent or "other" if they lost the nomination?  That\'s where his loyalties lie - with himself.  Imagine if he\'d lost the nomination, but ended up winning the election...  He\'d have an I or a D in front of his name, and Fox would be *livid* at what he\'s pulled so far...  Meeting with North Korea?  Imposing tariffs on European and bordering nations?  Imagine if Obamas daughters had copyrights approved by China just after they struck a deal with a Chinese company...?  Seriously, RNC?  Standing by your man for the sake he has a pulse?'
'Tariffs = taxes. Trump raises taxes. Trump supporters cheer. \n\nWomp womp. '

'This is one of those glimmers of actual facism, though.  I have avoided that term until now, but the national security tariffs put the power to kill other businesses in the hands of Nucor and American Steel.  Thousands of companies have asked for exemptions and only a couple dozen have been granted.  The reason is that Nucor and AS can object and get the exemption shut down based only on "we intend to, or could possibly provide this material".  Almost every one of these companies claim the imported materials are critical for them to continue operating at a profit, and the tariff would put them under.\n\nThis is dangerous to capitalism because only companies that support the Party get a seat at the table (or literal cabinet seat), and all other companies are at their mercy.  Since campaign contributions are so critical to winning elections in the US, the Party can effectively starve the opposition to death by selectively attacking their industries.  Do tariffs on Chinese goods hurt Amazon, which has been a vocal opponent and target of the president?  Yup.  Can we expect more blanket tariffs that undermine businesses that rely on global trade, only for Party-loyal businesses to get exemptions?  Naturally.\n\nThis is the exact relationship with big businesses that the Nazi party had with its major industry partners.  They picked winners, which got all the contracts, which drove anybody else out of business, leaving only party loyal oligarchs in charge of the largest employers in the country.'

"I'm honestly surprised by this. You'd think (Acting President) John Kelly would have realized that even just a single photo of Trump hugging hurricane victims, like Bush or Obama had, would be totally eaten up by his base. Heck, it might bump his approval up by a point or two.\n\nThe only reason I can think of is that such a large portion of the country despises Trump that the risk of an incident was too great."
"The other painful irony about Trumps reaction is that he's pledged to give Houston a unlimited taxpayer funds to clean up after Harvey *immediately*. He cannot do that. No one in the American government can give away money without checks and balances. Any relief money has to be approved by Congress and that tends to take a while. Plus cleaning up after a historic flood doesn't take a couple of months. It takes YEARS.

Stop using the Hurricane as a political prop you scumbags. He did better than Bush did with Katrina. That is all that matters. Next story.'
"I get the feeling that if he had met with victims, many would be calling him out for making it about a 'photo op'. \n\nI'm glad that he didn't visit the hardest hit areas, because the presidential TFR (temporary flight restriction) could've grounded much needed rescue aircraft within a 35-mile radius."
"I am by no means a trump supporter, but this is honestly the dumbest thing to report on. Trump's job is to help organize a relief effort. His number one goal is to save as many lives as possible. Who gives a shit if he poses for pictures with victims? That does absolutely nothing to help efforts underway in Houston "

Kilimnik told the Post that the two “discussed ‘unpaid bills’ and ‘current news.’ But he said the sessions were ‘private visits’ that were ‘in no way related to politics or the presidential campaign in the U.S.’” The emails preceding the meeting, however, suggest they had more than bills and news to discuss.

'By Tom Hamburger,, Rosalind S. Helderman and Adam Entous    \nOctober 2 at 15:08 ET    \n\nAssociates of President Trump and his company have turned over documents to federal investigators that reveal two previously unreported contacts from Russia during the 2016 campaign, according to people familiar with the matter.    \nIn one case, Trump’s personal attorney and a business associate exchanged emails weeks before the Republican National Convention about traveling to an economic conference in Russia that would be attended by top Russian financial and government leaders, including President Vladi\xadmir Putin, according to people familiar with the correspondence.    \nIn the other case, the same Trump attorney, Michael Cohen, received a proposal in late 2015 for a Moscow residential project from a company founded by a billionaire who once served in the Russian Senate, these people said. The previously unreported inquiry marks the second proposal for a Trump-branded Moscow project that was delivered to the company during the presidential campaign and has since come to light.    \nCohen declined the invitation to the economic conference, citing the difficulty of attending so close to the GOP convention, according to people familiar with the matter. And Cohen rejected the Moscow building plan.    \nNonetheless, the information about the interactions has been provided to congressional committees as well as special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as they investigate whether Trump associates coordinated with Russian efforts to interfere in the U.S. election, according to people familiar with the inquiries who, like others cited in this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the inquiry.    Details of the communications were turned over by the Trump Organization in recent days to the White House, defense lawyers and government investigators and described to The Washington Post.Though there is no evidence that these Russia-related entreaties resulted in further action, the email communications about them show that Trump’s inner circle continued receiving requests from Russians deep into the presidential campaign. After WikiLeaks began to publish emails from the Democratic National Committee that were widely believed to have been hacked at the direction of Moscow, Trump said on several occasions that he had no financial ties to Russia. In July 2016, he tweeted: “for the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia.”    \nBut the new disclosures add to an emerging picture in which Trump’s business and campaign were repeatedly contacted by Russians with interests in business and politics. Trump’s son, son-in-law, campaign chairman, low-level foreign policy advisers and, now, Cohen, one of his closest business confidants, all fielded such inquiries in the weeks before or after Trump accepted the nomination.    \nThe documents also underscore the Trump company’s long-standing interest in doing business in Moscow.    \nIn a statement Monday, Cohen stressed that he did not attend the economic forum. “I did not accept this invitation,” he said. “I have never been to Russia.”    \nCohen has said he will cooperate with authorities.    \nAlan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization, said the newly disclosed Moscow proposal needed to be understood “in context.”    “Like any other international real estate brand, it is not uncommon for third party developers to submit proposals for potential real estate projects all over the world,” he said, adding that, only a “very small percentage of these proposals are ever pursued.”    \nWhite House lawyer Ty Cobb declined to comment, saying he was not familiar with the documents.    \nThe June 2016 email to Cohen about the economic conference came from Felix Sater, a Russian-born real estate developer and former Trump business associate. Sater encouraged Cohen to attend the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, with Sater telling Cohen that he could be introduced to Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian prime minister, top financial leaders and perhaps to Putin, according to people familiar with the correspondence. At one point, Sater told Cohen that Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, could help arrange the discussions, according to a person familiar with the exchange.Robert Wolf, an attorney for Sater, declined to comment.    \nThe correspondence included a formal invitation to the conference from the Russian leader of the event, according to people familiar with the Trump Organization documents. The invitation included a letter signed by a conference official designed to help Cohen get a visa from the Russian government.    \nCohen and Sater had earlier that year been working on a deal to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. The email exchange did not directly address the Moscow Trump Tower plan that Cohen, Sater and Trump had been working on earlier in 2016, according to people familiar with the correspondence.    But Sater was eager to rekindle interest in the project, which had been canceled five months earlier, according to a person familiar with his thinking.    \nThe project had begun in the fall of 2015, when Trump was competing for the GOP nomination. He signed a so-called letter of intent in October 2015 to license his name to the Moscow developer working with Sater to construct what they hoped would be one of the tallest buildings in the world.In January 2016, Cohen emailed Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, saying the project had stalled and asking for assistance in pushing it forward. Cohen has said he received no response from Peskov and canceled the deal shortly thereafter.    \nPeskov has said he received the email but did not reply. He said Sunday that he did not remember any discussions about Cohen attending the St. Petersburg economic forum. But he said the conference, an annual event, is designed to allow attendees to meet with government and business leaders.    \n“My job [is] to assist in that!” he wrote in a text message.    \nCohen rebuffed the invitation, and the project was not restarted.    \nSater, who emigrated from Russia to the U.S. as a youngster, served time in jail as a young man following a bar fight and then was convicted in 1998 for his role in a Mafia-linked stock fraud. He has also been hailed for cooperating in the past with U.S. Justice Department probes in undisclosed national security matters.    \nSater has had a long relationship with Cohen, whom he knew in high school, and with Trump. A firm in which he played a principal role, Bayrock, partnered in building the Trump Soho tower in New York City. And Sater and Cohen met with a Ukrainian legislator in 2017 to discuss how to promote a Ukrainian peace plan to the new Trump White House team.    The newly disclosed documents show publicly for the first time that, in addition to Sater’s efforts, the Trump Organization fielded another inquiry for a Moscow project during the presidential campaign.That proposal originated with Russian billionaire Sergey Gordeev, a Moscow real estate mogul who served through 2010 as a member of the Russian Senate.    \nThe discussions about working with Gordeev took place via email between Cohen and an international financier he had worked with in the past, Giorgi Rtskhiladze, according to people familiar with the correspondence.    \nA spokesman for Rtskhiladze, Melanie A. Bonvicino, confirmed the proposal for a Trump-branded residential development, saying a 13-page document with pictures was delivered in October 2015.    \nBut, Bonvicino said, Cohen informed Rtskhiladze in 2015 that the Trump company could not pursue the project because it was already committed to another developer in Russia — a reference to the proposal being guided by Sater.No letter of intent was ever signed, according to people familiar with the interaction. Cohen and Rtskhiladze “did not speak of the project again,” Bonvicino said.A spokeswoman for Gordeev’s company said he had no comment.    \nRtskhiladze has had a long-standing interest in working with Trump in the region and pursued a project to build a Trump Tower in Batumi, Georgia, overlooking the Black Sea. Trump traveled to Georgia in 2012 to promote the Batumi deal and was paid nearly $1 million in upfront cash, but the project was never built and was formally canceled by the Trump Organization in December, as Trump prepared to take office.    \nIn an interview in 2016, Rtskhiladze told The Post he was encouraging Trump to build a tower in Moscow.    \n“Everyone wants to build a magnificent tower. It’s challenging, but I think achievable, with that name,” Rtskhiladze said.    \nCarol D.

Trump’s son, son-in-law, campaign chairman, low-level foreign policy advisers and, now, Cohen, one of his closest business confidants, all fielded such inquiries in the weeks before or after Trump accepted the nomination.\n> \n> The documents also underscore the Trump company’s long-standing interest in doing business in Moscow.\n> \n> In a statement Monday, Cohen stressed that he did not attend the economic forum. “I did not accept this invitation,” he said. “I have never been to Russia.”\n> \n> Cohen has said he will cooperate with authorities.\n> \n> Alan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization, said the newly disclosed Moscow proposal needed to be understood “in context.”\n> \n> “Like any other international real estate brand, it is not uncommon for third party developers to submit proposals for potential real estate projects all over the world,” he said, adding that, only a “very small percentage of these proposals are ever pursued.”\n> \n> White House lawyer Ty Cobb declined to comment, saying he was not familiar with the documents.\n> \n> The June 2016 email to Cohen about the economic conference came from Felix Sater, a Russian-born real estate developer and former Trump business associate. Sater encouraged Cohen to attend the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, with Sater telling Cohen that he could be introduced to Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian prime minister, top financial leaders and perhaps to Putin, according to people familiar with the correspondence. At one point, Sater told Cohen that Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, could help arrange the discussions, according to a person familiar with the exchange.\n> \n> Robert Wolf, an attorney for Sater, declined to comment.\n> \n> The correspondence included a formal invitation to the conference from the Russian leader of the event, according to people familiar with the Trump Organization documents. The invitation included a letter signed by a conference official designed to help Cohen get a visa from the Russian government.\n> \n> Cohen and Sater had earlier that year been working on a deal to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. The email exchange did not directly address the Moscow Trump Tower plan that Cohen, Sater and Trump had been working on earlier in 2016, according to people familiar with the correspondence.\n> \n> But Sater was eager to rekindle interest in the project, which had been canceled five months earlier, according to a person familiar with his thinking.\n> \n> The project had begun in the fall of 2015, when Trump was competing for the GOP nomination. He signed a letter of intent in October 2015 to license his name to the Moscow developer working with Sater to construct what they hoped would be one of the tallest buildings in the world.\n> \n> In January 2016, Cohen emailed Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, saying the project had stalled and asking for assistance in pushing it forward. Cohen has said he received no response from Peskov and canceled the deal shortly thereafter.\n> \n> Peskov has said he received the email but did not reply. He said Sunday that he did not remember any discussions about Cohen attending the St. Petersburg economic forum. But he said the conference, an annual event, is designed to allow attendees to meet with government and business leaders.\n> \n> “My job [is] to assist in that!” he wrote in a text message.\n> \n> Cohen rebuffed the invitation, and the project was not restarted.\n> \n> Sater, who emigrated from Russia to the U.S. as a youngster, served time in jail as a young man following a bar fight and then was convicted in 1998 for his role in a Mafia-linked stock fraud. He has also been hailed for cooperating in the past with U.S. Justice Department probes in undisclosed national security matters.\n> \n> Sater has had a long relationship with Cohen, whom he knew in high school, and with Trump. A firm in which he played a principal role, Bayrock, partnered in building the Trump Soho tower in New York City. And Sater and Cohen met with a Ukrainian legislator in 2017 to discuss how to promote a Ukrainian peace plan to the new Trump White House team.\n> \n> [Trump’s former lawyer to testify in public next month in Senate’s Russia probe]\n> \n> The newly disclosed documents show publicly for the first time that, in addition to Sater’s efforts, the Trump Organization fielded another inquiry for a Moscow project during the presidential campaign.\n> \n> That proposal originated with Russian billionaire Sergei Gordeev, a Moscow real estate mogul who served through 2010 as a member of the Russian Senate.\n> \n> The discussions about working with Gordeev took place via email between Cohen and an international financier he had worked with in the past, Giorgi Rtskhiladze, according to people familiar with the correspondence.\n> \n> A spokesman for Rtskhiladze, Melanie A. Bonvicino, confirmed the proposal for a Trump-branded residential development, saying a 13-page document with pictures was delivered in October 2015.\n> \n> But, Bonvicino said, Cohen informed Rtskhiladze in 2015 that the Trump company could not pursue the project because it was already committed to another developer in Russia — a reference to the proposal being guided by Sater.\n> \n> No letter of intent was ever signed, according to people familiar with the interaction. Cohen and Rtskhiladze “did not speak of the project again,” Bonvicino said.\n> \n> A spokeswoman for Gordeev’s company said he had no comment.\n> \n> Rtskhiladze has had a long-standing interest in working with Trump in the region and pursued a project to build a Trump Tower in Batumi, Georgia, overlooking the Black Sea. Trump traveled to Georgia in 2012 to promote the Batumi deal and was paid nearly $1 million in upfront cash, but the project was never built and was formally canceled by the Trump Organization in December, as Trump prepared to take office.\n> \n> In an interview in 2016, Rtskhiladze told The Post he was encouraging Trump to build a tower in Moscow.\n> \n> “Everyone wants to build a magnificent tower. It’s challenging, but I think achievable, with that name,” Rtskhiladze said.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> Carol D.

And Cohen rejected the Moscow building plan.\n\nSo Cohen did not go. But someone close to Cohen did.. Sergei Millian.\n\nHe is the [Guy on the left, standing next to trump](http://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/millian-trump-630.jpg)\n\nI am assuming the Economic conference was the mid June St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. \n\nWell here is Millian \n[Hanging out with the guy Manafort worked for](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OjMup18higA/WY8rnKU6JHI/AAAAAAAAnuM/ia7drV8rvfok07tSRliFrwHGT_7ydE9agCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-08-12%2Bat%2B12.18.32%2BPM%2Bcopy.jpg) at that conference. \n\nA great quote from him:\n\n>"He introduced me to his right-hand man—Michael Cohen," Millian said in an interview with RIA Novosti, a Russian media outlet.  "Cohen is Trump’s main lawyer, all contracts go through him.  Subsequently, a contract was signed with me to promote one of their real estate projects in Russia. . . .  You can say I was their exclusive broker."  \n\nSo a guy who is close with Cohen, and promotes Trump tower Moscow, is at a Russian economic conference, meeting with Oeg Dripaska.\n\nThe same conference where Russia was talking with countries about selling 19.5% of Rosfnet.\n\n>ussia could engage in talks with Italian officials over the privatization of 19.5 percent of Rosneft shares, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich said.\n\n>We are currently discussing the matter with all of our strategic partners. There are Italian officials at the forum, including the Prime Minister. We’ll see if they are going to be interested. However, we will take into consideration all of the possibilities. We are on good terms with Chinese and Indian partners,” Dvorkovich said in an interview with Bloomberg TV at the SPIEF.\n\nThen in July Carter Page goes to Russia and talks to them about getting a piece of that deal.\n\nSee how this is starting to come together here?\n'

"Raise your hand if you're surprised. Anyone?"
"I just don't get it - how can this still be going on.  Trump clearly is in bed with Russia who obviously is trying to take over the western world.  The only thing protecting the US from a red take over are the progressives.\n\nWe are the only ones that care about a safe, clean and socially forward America.  Russia is basically at this point- the right wing of the planet and stand for all that is evil - Trump is just licking Putin's dick."
'Pretty sure the Russians offered to campaign via Facebook ads for Trump-o-nazi.'
'This headline implies that they requested only voters with Hispanic names, but that doesn\'t seem to be what happened at all. It sounds like they used this [Texas voter registration public information request form](https://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/forms/pi.pdf).\n\nThe form has a "Hispanic surname flag notation" box under "Flagging options," but it also has a distinct box titled "Hispanic Surnames only" in the section to limit the data returned. The story says that they checked the flag notation box, which does not limit the data returned. You have to read the story fairly carefully to not come away with the notion that they requested information only for Hispanic voters.\n\nEven if they didn\'t check the "flag notation" box, the commission could probably identify Hispanic names on their own.'
'[Well, that fits in with Greg Palast\'s findings.](https://youtu.be/F5bvygqCWRs?t=55s)\n\n(He\'s the guy who discovered Bush\'s election fraud in 2000 and did some of research into Enron)\n\nTL:DW; Trump says "Many people voted illegally".

It is very possible to meet a redneck white as snow with the last name Gonzalez or someone who is Hispanic with last name Davis. It would be far easier to separate Texans by their favorite football team or anything else really than separating out Hispanic last names. A lot less racist and offensive too.'

'>At around 5:30 a.m. ET, NBC News reported that it appeared that Lamb had won. The only outstanding votes are the approximately 200 absentee votes in Greene County, it said, and the provisional ballots that the district will count within the next seven days. **Even with those added to the count, it does not appear that rival Rick Saccone can catch up.** NBC News noted it was possible that there may be a recount ordered.'
'While I am the person who posted this, I will be more happy when this is official; for you know Saccone is going to demand a recount if there\'s any legal way for him to do so.\n\nIt appears the 0.5% margin rule does not apply in this case (Special Election)\n\nEDIT: My above phrase of "I will be more happy" : my only excuse is no morning coffee yet.; either that or I\'m going to sue Trump for ruining my own grammar.'
'I really like the campaign style Lamb ran. It\'s smart to get away from a national talking point and focus on the local issues. It\'s different from state to state. So this whole "Democrats need a message" is bullshit. Every district needs their own message and the democrats as a whole should adopt a more diverse approach. Not a one fits all message. This will also cut down on the purity tests and the party looking like a tribe. The country is very diverse and our representatives should reflect that.'
"I'm a Canadian... But I just want to say a big thank you for everybody in PA who went out and voted Democratic yesterday.  If anything, this goes to show that each and every vote is so very important.  The rest of the world is praying for you all to get back on your feet and to become a true leader again.  "
"Ha, the Dems have been outsmarted again. Everyone knows Lamb only won because the Dems bused in MILLIONS of illegal voters from Canada and Puerto Rico. My father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate saw it with his own eyes. With Trump’s steel tariffs, there won’t be enough buses available in November to do this in every district. The Dems think they have a winning strategy, but the Republicans will INCREASE their majority come this fall."
"From this morning's WaPo story on this:\n\n> The National Republican Congressional Committee said it was confident of a Saccone victory “after every legal vote is counted.”\n\nPrepare for fuckery. Stay vigilant, PA."

It works so much better as a underdog success story, pushing people to register to vote.  Every vote is so important we count them twice.'

I for one, hope he doesn't change his course at all."

'Actually I\'m pretty disgusted the carried interest "loophole" remains intact. That is something Trump actually campaigned against, yet the bill does not remove it. My guess is there would not be enough republican support if the loophole was removed. Why should a billionaire investor only pay 15% tax on their primary source of income (for managing investments), while the rest of us pay a lot more.'
"There are clearly some people who truly believed the Republicans would be fiscally responsible and reduce deficits.

"Anybody with any sense and decency should be disgusted with our government right now. This tax plan is a giveaway to the extremely wealthy. The bill is carefully written to screw blue states, and provide a dip in taxes just before the midterm elections and then again before the 2020 elections, as a means of boosting Republican voter support. Then, several years later, the regular peoples' taxes go back up and the corporations and extremely wealthy get to keep their permanent tax cuts. If, as expected, the Democrats are back in power by that time, it will look like they raised taxes!\n\nAnd all that is just some of the obvious stuff. This thing is a total suck for most Americans. "
'What would make me less upset is if the GOP came out, like they did in the 80s with Reagan and straight up tell people this is Supply-Side economics.\n\nWalk people through the tax, explain to them on a personal level (just like how Reagan did) how each facet of the tax bill will effect them. At least then they would tell the truth, or a part of it -- instead of this boasting using fancy adjectives to wow people as if this were some nightly sitcom and not the future of tax in the wealthiest nation in the history of the planet.'

Buying Republican is a great ROI if you don't care about the future of the country."
"Not to get down voted into oblivion, *but*...\n\nThis will actually cause real-dollar taxes to go down for many people in the next couple of years (until they phase out of course), and that is what people will notice.

Michael’s my attorney and you’ll have to ask Michael.”\n\n>Reporter: “Do you know where he got the money to make that payment?”\n\n>Trump: “No, I don’t know. “\n\n___\n\nGIULIANI’S EXCHANGE WITH FOX NEWS HOST SEAN HANNITY\n\nMAY 2, 2018\n\n>Giuliani said the payment of $130,000 to Daniels “is going to turn out to be perfectly legal. That money was not campaign money. Sorry, I’m giving you a fact now that you don’t know. It’s not campaign money, no campaign finance violation.”\n\n>Hannity: “So, they funneled it through the law firm.”\n\n>Giuliani: “They funneled it through the law firm, and the president repaid it.”\n\n>He later added: “When I heard Cohen’s retainer of $35,000 when he was doing no work for the president, I said, ‘That’s how he’s repaying it, with a little profit and a little margin for paying taxes for Michael.’”\n\n>Asked if Trump knew about the arrangement, Giuliani said: “He didn’t know about the specifics of it, as far as I know. But he did know about the general arrangement, that Michael would take care of things like this, like I take care of things like this for my clients. I don’t burden them with every single thing that comes along. These are busy people.”'

'> "Mr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA. These agreements are very common among celebrities and people of wealth," Trump continued. In this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in Arbitration for damages against Ms. Clifford (Daniels). The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair. Prior to its violation by Ms. Clifford and her attorney, this was a private agreement. Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll in this transaction."\n\n\n\nIs it just me or do these tweets sounds better written than his usual tweets?'

'R&D in neurodegeneration has been very challenging with almost no winners in 20 years. They’re keeping the same research budget, just shifting it to other programs and their VC wing to acquire whichever risky startup doing the innovation hits on something worthwhile. \n\nThe entire model of big pharma has shifted to outsourcing the early drug discovery work to tiny companies, so that shareholders only see winners and there are no failures. An Alzheimer’s program takes 20 years and a successful CEOs lifespan is 5. I’m not sure what policies will encourage better drug development in big pharma, but the current system does allow more spin-offs from university professors who believe in their science. It’s valid to question what % of their budget goes to R&D vs advertising and whether the incentives are aligned well, but this is a nuanced question. '
"Everyone is taking this out of context. They just flopped on an alzheimers trial, which means they lost billions of dollars on this. Given that other companies is like Biogen and Lilly seem to be on the cusp of having a successful alzheimers treatment, it doesn't make any sense economically speaking for Pfizer to start from scratch with another alzheimers attempt. It generally takes 10 years or so from drug discovery until FDA approval, assuming all the trials go well. So if Pfizer were to I vest a few more billion trying to get another drug through, then Lilly gets a drug approved in 3 years, that's just more money down the drain because they won't get hardly any of that market.\n\nSo many people have basically no knowledge of how the pharma industry works and thinks all these companies are just trying to scam consumers. When you actually see all the costs associated with creating new drugs and all the regulations that have to be followed, you actually gain an appreciation for this stuff.\n\nSource: am an engineer at a pharma company directly involved with clinical trial drugs"
"It's hard to say this is specifically evil corporate America. Research is hard, progress is hard. Understanding diseases at the molecular level is difficult in and of itself, not even depending on a well-understood disease, which Parkinson's and Alzheimer's are not.\n\nThis research may have been stagnated for years, which is alluded to in (either this) or a NPR article I read about it. Seems they're content letting competition continue R&D while they wait on some neuroscience breakthroughs, etc.\n\nEDIT: To be sure, there is a literal boatload of money to be had for a successful cure or treatment. Like, huge profits before time runs out on the patent (like most designer drugs)."
"Considering they're obviously out to make a profit, one can't blame them for wanting to invest elsewhere when the chances of finding a workable cure for these diseases is immensely low. As the article notes, little progress has been made. It's simply going to be difficult to rely on businesses to support research like this."
'“He says his organization and others will still focus on the most promising pathway to a cure: Trying to understand the mechanisms of these diseases, which are still very murky. Only once those riddles are solved can drug research truly move ahead.”\n'
"So, the article shows no connection between the tax cut and the ending of R&D in this area. As a shareholder, this move doesn't surprise me, but trying to link it to the tax bill seems disingenuous as best, an outright blatant attempt at clickbait at most."
'For profit medicine , justice,  and education are the things that should not be. Always hearing how profit drives innovation- yeah, towards profit, not health, freedom, or wellness. '
'Alternate headline: *“As number of employees nationally receiving bonuses due to tax cuts tops 1 million (and receives little-to-no-attention), private sector company — that has already invested hundreds of millions and has reached the end of its research on two fronts — decides what to do with its money.”*\n\nA bit wordy, yes, but probably more accurate. I mean honestly, is the **constant** outrage exhausting?'
"Should we putting any money into programs like this while children die of starvation/lack of clean water?  I'm always curious how folks rationalize keeping rich old people alive while poor children suffer."
'I work for one of the largest continuing care community companies in the United States. The secure dementia wings are slowly devouring our skilled nursing wings. If anything, we need significantly more research put into these diseases to slow down the insane increased rate of cases. '
'This is exactly what happens!!  Even Eisenhower back in the day believed that higher corporate taxes, not lower, actually spurred on R&D.   Why?  Well because companies can lower their tax burden by decreasing annual profit on paper, by reinvesting in their own company in the form of R&D. \n\nWhen companies have lower taxes they just pocket the money and enjoy the extra cash!'
"What your average Trump supporter will not understand... and frankly will have no interest in understanding is that companies are increasingly employing MBA holders for executive positions.  Many of which have never held a real working class job.  But above and beyond that they are quite literally taught to maximize short term earnings and to please stockholders/investors above all else.\n\nSo you get businesses that obsess over cutting costs because it's, quite frankly, a far easier way to increase profit margins than finding a way to increase revenue.  But since it's so much easier to cut you frequently find situations where new ideas just don't happen or when they do they never get anywhere.\n\nGreat way to make more money immediately, terrible way to run a business you want to ensure exists in the long term.  And godawful to line workers.\n\n"
'Jesus Big Pharma is becoming even more cancerous than Big Oil. Clearly shows how they are more focused on making short term kaching instead of actual in-demand pharmaceutical solutions to common and crippling diseases. By the way, there could be big financial returns in finding better treatments to chronic diseases like Alzheimer’s, if you’re like the guy who invented PCR (artificial DNA replication machine, which has a bunch of common uses today like criminal investigation and paternity testing) and then put a fat-ass patent on his invention'
'This is one small part of what makes a vibrant and well funded public sector scientific research program valuable. Companies like Pfizer are good at monetizing discoveries, but they have little incentive to put the work into the discoveries themselves.'
"When businessmen run companies, they're in it for the money.  In the old days the CEO of a company was an engineer or a scientist, but now CEOs are more desired if they have an MBA.  If a company can make more profit dragging its feet, or going against quick innovation, it will, because these companies aren't run by passionate people anymore.  Short term profits will win every time, and the effects of this will be the dramatic slowing of human triumph and discovery."
'This might get lost in the shuffle but the Millionaire Tax Break\'s decision to tax University endowments is also going to cut into research spending. Endowment dollars are designated by donors at the time of their gift, and the Universities are obligated to spend those funds accordingly. So any previously endowed gifts to support life sciences research, or really anything at all at a University (scholarships, faculty support, etc.) are now going to be taxed, meaning that the Universities are going to have to find money to cover those costs previously supported by philanthropy, resulting in less dollars overall available for research and the support of students and faculty doing that research. "Dur dur dur but Harvard has so much money in its endowment" is pretty much the only response ever given to this, which, while true, are funds that are all designated for the purposes of supporting research and higher education. The President of Harvard isn\'t even the best paid University leader in Massachusetts.'

I am not a lawyer.\n\ntl;dr on the money laundering stuff, Manafort was being paid tens of millions of dollars for his work promoting the Ukrainian pro-Russia government. In order to obfuscate the source of this money and to avoid paying taxes on it, he disguised it as "loans" from various companies and banks *he and his people* set up.\n\nThe indictment also refers quite a bit on pages 3, 22, and 23 to Manafort\'s work with Konstantin Kilimnik, aka "Person A". [Here\'s an excellent article about him.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/06/the-astonishing-tale-of-the-man-mueller-calls-person-a/562217/) I believe this document is the first to explicitly name Kilimnik as a defendant in Mueller\'s probe. [This CNN article](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/08/politics/paul-manafort-indictment-robert-mueller/index.html) seems to imply so, too.\n\n---\n\nPage 2:\n\n> Manafort, with the assistance of Gates, funneled millions of dollars in payments into numerous foreign nominee companies and bank accounts, opened by them and their accomplices in nominee names and in various foreign countries, including Cyprus, Saint Vincent & the Grenadines, and the **Seychelles**.\n\nHighlighted the Seychelles because it\'s just funny how many of these threads seem to involve the same locations and people, even if they\'re seemingly not connected. For anyone who forgot, [there\'s another leg of this investigation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/mueller-gathers-evidence-that-2016-seychelles-meeting-was-effort-to-establish-back-channel-to-kremlin/2018/03/07/b6a5fb8c-224b-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html?utm_term=.8bc3db2c369a) involving the Seychelles.\n\n---\n\nPage 3: \n\n> In total, more than $75,000,000 flowed through these offshore accounts.\n\n---\n\nPage 17:\n\n> In February 2012, Manafort, with the assistance of Gates, solicited two Washington, D.C. firms (Company A and company B) to lobby in the United States on behalf of Yanukovych, the Party of Regions, and the Government of Ukraine. For instance, Gates wrote to Company A that it would be "**representing the Government of Ukraine in [Washington] DC.**"\n\nThey *explicitly told these people* they were representing Ukraine, all while telling the US government otherwise.\n\n---\n\nPage 19:\n\n> "Our [Manafort and Gates\'] task was to assist the [Centre to] find representation in Washington, but at no time did our firm or members provide direct lobbying support."\n\nThe evidence on page 17 proves that Gates was lying on page 19.\n\n---\n\nPage 22-23, regarding his attempts to obfuscate his links to the pro-Russian Ukrainian government:\n\n> Manafort explained in an "eyes only" memorandum created in or about June 2012 that the purpose of the "super VIP" effort would be to "assemble a small group of high-level European highly influencial [sic] champions and politically credible friends who can act informally and without any visible relationship with the Government of Ukraine."\n\n---\n\nPage 30 explains that the United States is seeking forfeiture of more of his properties and assets. Including properties in New York City, and Arlington, Virginia.'
'Sure is a funny coincidence that all these criminals would be surrounding and supporting a totally innocent man.'
'It\'s worth pointing out, Manafort\'s indictment is for activities from 2006 through 2017, well past the campaign and into Trump\'s presidency.  And the indictment of the "former" GRU agent is huge, especially if it opens the possibility he could turn state evidence.'

'Share blue is referencing the NYT article that published earlier this week, [Mueller Has Early Draft of Trump Letter Giving Reasons for Firing Comey](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/us/politics/trump-comey-firing-letter.html?referer=https://t.co/gM27yBThpz?amp=1). In the article, the only mention of Pence is below: \n\n> Mr. Trump was back in Washington on Monday, May 8, when copies of the letter were handed out in the Oval Office to senior officials, including Mr. McGahn and Vice President Mike Pence. Mr. Trump announced that he had decided to fire Mr. Comey, and read aloud from Mr. Miller’s memo.\n\nBeing told of intention is not the same as "implicated" – especially if Pence didn\'t take any part in the first draft of the initial letter. Somehow, Shareblue took that sentence and somehow expanded it to 750 words. \n\n**Shareblue is a rag that should be blacklisted on this sub.** \n\nedit:Bolded. Also, would like to reference [Media Bia/Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/shareblue/), a site I often see referenced for sources on this sub. \n\n>**Factual Reporting: MIXED**\n\n>Notes: Shareblue is an online political news source.  It is affiliated with Blue Nation Review and David Brock.  This source, like Blue Nation Review has a strong left wing bias in story selection and wording. Shareblue also occasionally **publishes stories that are propagandist and misleading factually.**\n\nCongrats.

'Yes, a website called "Shareblue" is definitely the perfect source for news on an "impartial" subreddit.'

'I really do hope that if Trump goes, so does Pence. I would gladly take a President Ryan over Pence.'
'"plotted" = secretly make plans to carry out (an illegal or harmful action).\n\nWhile Trump definitely strategised  on firing Comey, the use of the word "plotted" implies it was illegal (hint: it wasn\'t) or harmful (other than to Comey\'s job, again, it wasn\'t)\n\nIts possible that Comey\'s firing may have been an obstruction of justice but that is a legal opinion and not a universal one, nor one that has been tested.  Trump had the legal authority to fire Comey, but it is still possible that firing him while the Russia probe was ongoing could amount to obstruction of justice.  The law here isn\'t black and white.  It is not enough to show that a defendant knew the act would have a side consequence of impeding an investigation; achieving that obstruction has to have been the specific intention.\n\nSo Trump would have to be proven to have a specific intention to obstruct an ongoing investigation as his primary motivation.  However, others have suggested that Trump\'s primary motivation was his anger with Comey in regards to the Clinton matter.   If so, obstruction would not be found.\n\nRegardless, the Department of Justice would not charge a sitting president.  If congress were overwhelmingly convinced that obstruction occurred (hint again:  they are divided mostly along partisan lines) they could impeach Trump.  Both Clinton in 1998 and Nixon in 1974 were accused of obstruction in their impeachment proceedings. \n\nIn short, it isn\'t so much a legal matter at this time as a political one.  Coming back to my main point, there wasn\'t a "plot" (using my definition above) per se, although there may have been an intention but I don\'t see an impeachment hearing in Trump\'s future at this point.'

'Rupert Murdoch killed the piece after it became clear Trump would win the GOP nomination. Just another reminder that Murdoch uses his media empire--beyond just Fox News--for partisan purposes.\n\n>And the reason, according to several defectors, was the Journal’s skidding reversal once Rupert Murdoch realized Trump could win. Several sources pointed to the editorials by one writer, James Freeman. “All-in for Ted Cruz” during the primaries, Freeman wrote a strong attack on Trump’s Mob dealings, and had a second ready to go. But as Trump got closer to clinching the nomination, Paul Gigot kept delaying publication, saying “it needed work.” Once Trump became the likely Republican nominee, Freeman executed a neat volte-face. “The facts suggest that Mrs. Clinton is more likely to abuse liberties than Mr. Trump,” he wrote. “America managed to survive Mr. Clinton’s two terms, so it can stand the far less vulgar Mr. Trump.”'

"Let's remember that on the campaign trail, Trump promised over and over again that he would replace obamacare with something better and cheaper that would insure everyone. Assuming they believed him, they weren't necessarily voting to repeal obamacare, they were voting for better, cheaper health care. It's a promise that he never intended to keep, but they completely dropped the pretense of replacing it with a superior product, and the unknown quantity of people in those states who voted for something better are having the rug pulled from under them while being told that it's what they wanted."
"As someone who is a big fan of Obamacare, this statistic is really misleading. As far as I can tell, they are only looking at enrollees on federally-run exchanges, not those run by the states. (Note that California isn't listed as one of the top states, even though it has a huge number of enrollees.) \n\nThe program was intended for State governments to run the exchanges, but for the most part only blue states actually chose to do so (because Republican governors and legislatures were being babies about doing anything to help Obama.) So it shouldn't be surprising that the states that we're politically opposed to Obamacare are also those that predominantly went for Trump. \n\nEdit: To add some numbers it looks like the real number is 7,761,594 enrollees in Trump states, which is 63.5% of the total 12,216,003.  [Source](www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/total-marketplace-enrollment). Those states have a total population that makes up 56.6% of the U.S. population. So Trump states do have disproportionately more enrollees, but not to the extreme the article suggests. Also, as other commenters have mentioned, the differences between Trump and Hillary states in adoption of the medicaid expansion probably would account for most of the ~7% gap in expected enrollment that these numbers show. "
'We have some friends who fall into this category. They use Obamacare and voted for Trump hoping he would help reduce their premiums. I wonder how that’s working out for them. '
"They didn't enroll in Obamacare, they enrolled in The Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhile I know that isn't a different thing. They clearly don't."
"And people definitely sign up for Obamacare because they love it, not because they face a fine of thousands of dollars if they don't."
'Amazing isnt it? I lived in KS with my parents until last year. They hated obama care and were always talking non stop about how their coverage was so much worse and so much more expensive since they were forced to switch.

"I wish someone would explain why we are giving money to insurance companies instead of the doctors and nurses who actually provide healthcare. \n\nEveryone seems to think health insurance and healthcare are the same thing. In reality, health insurance is run by bankers and salesmen who don't give two shits about the health and welfare of Americans. \n\nInsurance companies are bound by law to do everything they possibly can to deny people health care, since that is the way they make profit for their share holders. I still don't understand how so many people, especially the democrats, are OK with propping up a system that is designed to place bets and gamble on peoples health."

'I\'m kind of surprised he didn\'t go with, "Can you imagine how few families crooked Hillary would have called?  Luckily I won the electoral college by 600 which is impressive because no Republican has ever won the electoral college before."  '
">So to recap: The president described a preference for Norwegian (i.e. white) immigrants over those from “shithole” countries (African nations). He gave the Congressional Black Caucus the back of the hand *(“At one point, Durbin told the president that members of that caucus — an influential House group — would be more likely to agree to a deal if certain countries were included in the proposed protections, according to people familiar with the meeting. Trump was curt and dismissive, saying he was not making immigration policy to cater to the CBC and did not particularly care about that bloc’s demands, according to people briefed on the meeting. ‘You’ve got to be joking,’ one adviser said, describing Trump’s reaction.”)* He blew up a possible deal on the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals program, bragged about his actions to friends and then lied to the public about what he said. Two U.S. senators lied as well and then were double-crossed by White House aides.\n\nWell, that's worse than initially reported.\n\n"
'The important thing here is that the White House *outed* them for lying -- the shithole/shithouse story was given to WaPo by three WH aides. So:\n\n> The incident is telling in many respects, but none more important for Republicans than this: *They can lie and enable the president hoping to score brownie points, but this White House won’t repay loyalty in kind. Instead, Republicans will find themselves humiliated.*\n'
'Why do we need Senators from shithole states like Arkansas and Georgia?  How about more Senators from places like Connecticut and California?'
"Perdue's cousin is Sonny Perdue, who is Agricultural Secretary under Trump, and Cotton wants to be appointed CIA director.  They want to make a play for Trump's ego to prove their loyalty. "
'DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is currently testifying to the Senate oversight committee.\n\nShe just said she doesn\'t know if Norway is a predominately white country.\n\nI think she\'s incredibly smart and well-informed on policy.  I trust her policy decisions, but she\'s killing her credibility by trying to dance around this issue.  My verdict is still out as to whether she\'s doing the dance so that she can affect change positively from the inside, or if she\'s a \'true believer\'.  I\'ll give her the benefit of the doubt for now, but she\'s running on real thin ice.  \n\n"Dicky" Durbin is up next for the Dems... should be an interesting questioning period.'
'What\'s sad is that Trump expects 100% loyalty but he feels no loyalty to anyone else.  It\'s only going to be a matter of time before he fesses up and admits that he said it, leaving these to "jumos" swinging.\n\nSomething that reminded me of Trump.\n\nBut the way I talk to my clients is I don’t talk about psychopaths to them but there are lots of women in abusive relationships so I often talk about bullies and abusers.  And I say to them that there are two important things to know about bullies or abusers and the first is as far as a bully is concerned people are like furniture and you simply move them around to suit your purpose.  And if you’ve got no particular purpose for someone well you just put them in the shed until you need them again and then you pull them out when you need to use them then put them back again. So for most of us that’s pretty hard to come to terms with because most of us can’t imagine treating people like that.  The second thing I tell them is that in terms of communication of course there is a huge amount of trust between two people talking to each other.  I trust that the other person pretty much is telling me the truth as they know it and I hope that they trust that I’m telling them truth as I know it or to the best of my ability.  But with a bully or an abuser or a psychopath words are kind of like a smorgasbord laid out in front of them and they simply choose the words that suits them for that particular purpose to achieve the effect that they want to achieve absolutely right now with that person.  And if circumstances change literally in five minutes they will say something completely different because they’ve chosen differently from the smorgasbord.  And if you try to call them on it well firstly their attitude is well that was then this is now and secondly well I never said that and thirdly you’re always confused and then fourthly they do a sort of 180 spin of you and they say, well you’re criticizing me about that thing well what about that thing you did.  So, they’re very good about changing focus. -Psychologist/Criminologist speaking in Episode 23:Who is Bo Dukes from Up and Vanished podcast at 15:23.'
"What if... Trump supporters could be convinced that everything Trump is accused of having done is true. Would it matter?\n\nOr would they still be willing to sell their souls for ...whatever it is they're selling their souls for?"
'It\'s telling that the DHS secretary was testifying to Congress today, she went with the "I don\'t recall" angle. \n\nThat\'s her doing her best to please dear leader while also making sure she doesn\'t get a contempt of congress charge.'
"It'd be awesome if he could think he's avoiding it, get on Air Force One, they take off, he goes to hide in his room and BAM - there's Mueller, waiting for him.  Unrealistic, but it'd still be awesome.  "
'Anyone thinking Trump is ready to face Mueller should read this:  https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-25/i-ve-watched-trump-testify-under-oath-it-isn-t-pretty\n\nBottom line is, despite all the bluster from Trumpland, his lawyers aren’t idiots. They know the minute Trump is put under oath he’s toast. Simply because even if he didn’t collude with the Russians (and I don’t think he knowingly did), it’d be too easy to nail him on obstruction, money laundering, and probably the half-dozen other things that he absolutely did. \n\nWorse, he just doesn’t have the mental faculties to match wits with the Bob Mueller’s of the world, so he’d probably end up admitting wrongdoing and not even be aware of it. '
'I thought Trump was looking forward to his little chat w Mueller?! \nI guess he was being honest again. Everything he says is like Opposite Day. I feel like this is opposite year... is this real life, or some glitch in second life. '
'Yeah this doesn’t look like something a cognizant, innocent president would do'
"Trump wants to testify under oath to clear his name, but those damn bureaucrats keep messing things up for common men like him. Aw shucks.\n\nWell, he couldn't testify (because of Jew lawyers) but he was willing to, and if that's not enough to convince you of his innocence, well then you just have it in for him. "
"This isn't that bad. I'm no Trump supporter, but every lawyer's job is to make sure they pursue every avenue of limiting the strength of their opponent's argument. This is what I'd expect them to do, even if Trump were 100% innocent."
'Good luck with that Fucko'
'"The fifth amendment would be a public relations nightmare."\n\nCan\'t see it being more of a PR nightmare than say, having an affair with a porn star while your wife is at home with a newborn.  That thing Trump said about shooting someone in the middle of 5th Ave (or wherever) seems like the truest pronouncement ever to pass his lips.'
'Odds are this is inconsequential to the case Mueller is building.  He knows full well that Donnie will stonewall him.  As it is said, prosecutors don’t ask questions they don’t already know the answers to.  Or he’s giving Donnie the chance to provide a motive other than the One Mueller has decided upon.  \n\nIn the end though an interview is just a way to tighten the noose further.  Mueller knows Trump isn’t going to provide any information.  But his refusal to be interviewed would also play into Mueller’s hand.  If the offer is never extended then Mueller gets accused of never hearing trump’s side of the story before rendering judgement.\n\nTo;dr there won’t be an interview and mueller knew this before he offered and Donnie is already sunk.'
'Normally I’d be fine with anyone trying to take advantage of every legal opportunity they are allowed to help in an investigation or trial. We all have that right, even the President. But when the President is working not to have to answer questions it’s really not a good look. It’s another example that when you’re president there can be a big difference between what you can do and what you should do.  '
"Y'know, maybe if he wasn't breaking the law, he wouldn't need to have a legal team looking for precedents and loop holes to get him out of it.  I know Conservatives are bleating that this is all a sham and he's innocent but if that's true, then why does he need a legal team to get him out of answering questions under oath?"
"Here's a tip for everybody:\n\nIf you publicly call somebody a liar, but they can prove that you know they aren't lying about the thing you were accusing them of lying about, that's defamation."
'if this ends with Cohen getting disbarred, I will be so happy. '
"> Reacting to the latest development, CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said it is another attempt to compel Cohen, or perhaps even the President, into a deposition under oath.\n\nIt's going to be so glorious if Avenatti is able to move his way toward discovery and/or testimony under oath for either of them."
"Watching Avenatti on MSNBC ... he's confident and aggressive and having fun at this game because he knows he's winning. Also he's hot AF."
"Her lawyer has the kind of confidence and intensity of a character from an Aaron Sorkin script. He's passionate and focused and I love listening to him speak."
"Avenatti's CNN segment against Cohen's lawyer was the best TV I've seen this year. Toobin was about to crack."
'Why does a porn star have a more competent attorney than the President of the United States of America?'
"I feel like they've been baiting him for quite some time now. This sideshow is HIGHLY amusing.  "
'This is fun. The more time Donnie has to spend sulking and playing golf, the less time he has to MAGA, and the better it is for the rest of us.    \ne: LOL the butthurt donnie brigade finally showed up'
'Republican Party will pardon after he’s guilty.'
"I sincerely hope she doesn't settle outside of court for 10+ million or something, which for all we know, could be all she's after. \n\nWhat matters to me is if Cohen was reimbursed directly through the campaign funds, which would against the law and have some pretty satisfying legal consequences, no matter what they be. We already know Trump is a liar, so it doesn't matter if Trump gets caught in a lie or looks silly, not to his supporters at least. We don't need a spicy TMZ style affair story. We need legal repercussions."
'Fucking Proactive like A BOSS!'
"Every president should have this!\n\nThe role of president is an experience of unbelievable extremity. Who is to say the human brain is meant to be able to take on the responsibilities of safeguarding over 250 million people? Who is to say the human brain is meant to take on a decision like dropping atom bombs on cities.\n\nNo matter how put together someone is, mental health checkups are essential. It's crazy that we get physicals done for preventative reasons, but people think there needs to be an issue before getting mental health checkups.\n\nHighly in support of this bill, especially with Trump in office. But hopefully, it will stay in effect with future POTUSes.\n\nEDIT: Wow. I woke up to quite the responses. Yes, I know there's actually 320m people. I put 250 as just a general high number. But one response made a good point that POTUS honestly is expected to maintain peace and safety for the entire globe.\n\nI love that there's clearly a lot to discuss on this topic. And that it doesn't seem too partisan at all. We all seem to want or not want this for bipartisan reasons."
"this is the closest thing to a clean exit he can get. It's effectively an out - take the test, find evidence of dementia (regardless of whether it's there or not), resign for health reasons, get a heap of sympathy and let his supporters use it as an excuse for his behaviour (they're still on the hook for the white supremacy shit, but let's see how many still come out of the woodwork after he's gone...).\n\nIf he refuses this, he's an idiot, and he'll be going down in flames - the big question is whether enough republicans are smart enough to see it that way to support it."
'My god, you guys getting desperate over here? If you really want to win elections for the Dems why not give a mental health examination to Maxine Waters? Or better yet, senile Nancy Pelosi'
'Lets impeach trump for collusion with russia! Oh well, that didnt work\n\nLets impeach trump for obstruction of justice! Oh... that didnt work as well....\n\nHi guys! New idea! Lets impeach trump for... being mentaly ill?\n\nI wonder whats next on the list'
'While this bill may sound like a good idea to get rid of Trump. I would be afraid of future implications. I could see the Republicans bringing up a bill like this when the next Democrat is in office just because they disagree with him/her. Trump definitely has some sort of mental issue but it will have to be dealt with within the Republican party.  Of course, they are prone to do what is best for the Republican Party, not what is best for the country as a whole.'
'Who will hire this Psychologist(s)? What tests will they use? What safeguards will be in place to ensure that they won\'t skew the results due to a political bias or economic incentive? Will this be a permanent thing that can be applied to the next president? What would happen if Trump says "No"?\n\nSo many questions. '
'Lmfao he said there are good people (among the 60% of Americans) who want to keep the Confederate statues, and some west coast Democrat uses that to call for a shrink.\n\nAuthoritarian-signaling is big on the Left these days.'
"It's interesting to see the rednecks and orange nazi sympathizers come in here and still defend.  So desperate.  Your dear leader is going bye bye soon. And speaking of mental health checkups...if you voted for Trump and still support him, it wouldn't hurt to schedule one."
"Ffs stop with using crap like this to change the outcome of the election. He won the election by playing by the rules and the people voting him in got exactly the guy they wanted, it's not like he suddenly behaved out of character. This is not how democracy should work...\n\nFix the system so people like that can't get elected in the future. Fix the first past the post system so we can get rid of the two party system"
'To be honest, I think making the president see a psychologist is a good idea no matter who it is.\n\nEverybody could use at least a little therapy. I imagine someone in a position like that needs it even more.'
'Perhaps a full review and updated rules need to be done before anyone ends up on the ballot. Physical and Mental fitness should be required. Full disclosure of mental and physical capacity, taxes, businesses conflicts, etc should be required. Ethics review was blocked repeatedly- all of these are important clues of what needs fixing. Most average citizens would be blocked from employment with similar background and history. Doubt he could get clearance for a census job, but he now holds the codes for nuclear weapons. Grateful for this legislation, hope it encourages more serious debate about requirements for the top job in the states.'
"Anyone else feeling town because on one hand donald is a massive dildo, but on the other hand if Russia's hacking purpose was to undermine US credibility and divide the population, they're doing a wildly good job with it?"

Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. It\'s terrible. It\'s just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I\'ll tell you. First of all the number 2, by the way, I love the number 2. It\'s probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it\'s probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I\'m being honest, I mean, if I\'m being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he\'s a zero that I don\'t like. Though, I probably shouldn\'t say that. He\'s a nice guy but he\'s like, \'10101000101,\' on and on, like that. He\'s like a computer!

Nader was supposed to join them, but the initial payment for the intelligence contract was late. He delayed his trip to the U.S. for a day to make sure it was wired.\n\n>On Jan. 17, Broidy reported that he had received the first installment — $36 million.\n\n>“Terrific!” Nader wrote before his flight. “First among many to go!”\n\n>Hours after that money transfer, Nader and Broidy discovered that, despite all their precautions, they had not escaped notice.\n\n>When Nader landed at Dulles Airport outside Washington, D.C., a team of FBI agents working for Mueller was there to meet him. He was relieved of his electronic devices and later agreed to cooperate. It is unclear why Nader was detained, but he is a link between the Trump campaign and the Russian investor who attended the meeting in the Seychelles.\n\nHaha. These fucking idiots. '

Trump refused the offer while looking me in the eye; he pointed out that his net worth should include an equity boost of $87 million profit. I believed then that he used a staffer to stage the call, and I resisted the fictitious valuation.

The episode, which has not been previously reported, illustrates the common cause that Russian and American gun rights groups were forming in the years leading up to the 2016 election through former National Rifle Association president David Keene. Keene appointed Bolton to the NRA\'s international affairs subcommittee in 2011. Russian politician Alexander Torshin helped establish The Right to Bear Arms and cultivate ties with American gun rights groups including the NRA. As a Putin ally, Torshin served as the deputy speaker of Russia\'s parliament for more than a decade, and also spent time on Russia\'s National Anti-Terrorism Committee, a state body that includes the director of Russia\'s internal security service.\nThe Bolton video appears to be another plank in a bridge built by Russia to conservative political organizations inside the United States. It\'s unclear why Russian leaders wanted to curry favor with the NRA, but Torshin and Keene appeared to have developed close ties over in the years prior to the 2016 election. It\'s a relationship that has outsized importance now that the FBI is reportedly investigating whether Torshin illegally funneled money to the NRA to assist the Trump campaign in 2016, as McClatchy reported in January. The NRA has denied wrongdoing.\n\nYouTube experimental ad with Cambridge Analytica - https://investigaterussia.org/video/john-bolton-thom-tillis-ad\n\nanother ad - https://investigaterussia.org/video/john-bolton-porous-border-ad\n\nFollow the money - top left quadrant, Cambridge Analytica to John Bolton Super PAC to John Bolton - https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C9QnzlsXsAENsI5.jpg:large\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2018/03/01/590076949/depth-of-russian-politicians-cultivation-of-nra-ties-revealed\n\n>Russian politician Alexander Torshin said his ties to the NRA provided him access to Donald Trump and the opportunity to serve as a foreign election observer in the United States during the 2012 election. The difference in the case of Torshin is that for the first time, a Russian mafia boss – at least one identified as such by the Spanish anti-corruption prosecutor – is within the circle of support of the new president of the United States. As well as being a powerful banker, a leader of President Putin’s political party (United Russia) and his trusted ally, and a senator between 2001 and 2015 (in addition to being chairman of the upper house of the Russian parliament between May 19 and September 21, 2011), he is, according to the investigation carried out by the Spanish security forces, also a boss of a notorious criminal organization known as Taganskaya.\n\nhttps://elpais.com/elpais/2017/03/31/inenglish/1490984556_409827.html\n\n>Alexander Torshin (sometimes spelled Aleksandr Torshin) is the deputy governor of the Russian Central bank and reportedly tried to arrange a meeting between Putin and then-candidate Trump in May 2016. Torshin also offered to meet with Trump himself at the 2016 NRA convention. This offer made its way to Trump campaign aide Rick Dearborn, who passed this email along to Kushner, who reportedly declined the offer. Torshin has strong links to the Kremlin, as he previously served in Russian Parliament and sat on a government council alongside the director of the FSB. Although Spanish authorities have accused him of money laundering and being linked to the Russian mafia, Torshin has denied these accusations. Trump ultimately did not attend the 2016 NRA convention, but Donald Trump Jr. did attend and was reportedly introduced to Torshin. Torshin has also claimed he met Trump at the 2015 NRA convention, but the White House denied this meeting. President Trump reportedly planned to meet with Torshin in February 2017, but this meeting was canceled due to concerns over Torshin’s ties to the Russian mafia.\n\nhttps://themoscowproject.org/players/alexandertorshin\n\n>The official explanation fell apart as Trump repeatedly admitted he fired Comey to impede the Russia investigation. On May 10, the day after firing Comey, Trump met privately in the Oval Office with Kislyak and the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, to whom he described the former FBI Director as “crazy, a real nut job” and bragged that firing Comey had “taken off” the “great pressure” the investigation had created. On May 11, Trump told NBC’s Lester Holt he had planned to fire Comey over “this Russia thing” regardless of Rosenstein’s conclusion. (Rosenstein later confirmed in a closed-door Senate briefing that he knew Trump intended to fire Comey before writing the letter.)\n\nhttps://themoscowproject.org/collusion-chapter/chapter-5/\n\n>Lavrov\'s May 31 visit -- his first to North Korea since 2009 -- was seen as an attempt by Moscow to ensure its voice is heard in Pyongyang\'s diplomatic overtures with the United States and South Korea.\n\nhttps://www.rferl.org/a/russia-s-lavrov-in-north-korea-ahead-of-planned-trump-kim-summit/29260818.html\n\nPompeo\'s note says "Call Lavrov"\n\nhttp://noisyroom.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Pompeo1-e1527114256956.jpg\n\n'
'Is America great yet?'
'> At the root of that faith is a sense that public media serve the great mass of Americans rather than advertisers and political agendas. If Trump’s scheme were to succeed,\xa0says CPB president Patricia Harrison, the phasing our of funding “would at first devastate, and then ultimately destroy public media’s ability to provide early childhood content, life-saving emergency alerts, and local journalism.”\n\n> That’s especially true for rural America, where public and community radio stations are often lonely islands of intellectual honesty and journalistic responsibility in seas of ideological fanaticism and digital fakery. CPB funding helps public and community stations in major markets to do more, but in rural areas CPB funding is often the difference between survival and radio silence.\n\nThe National Endowment of the Arts does amazing things.\n\n'
'Everyone likes to complain about the liberal bias on public radio, but back when I listened every day I was always struck by how evenhanded and professional it was. Yes, they would interview liberal guests. They also interviewed Trump supporters. They interviewed alt-right figures. They reported in depth on issues affecting the "forgotten people" of America.\n\nThey truly are just operating for the public good. And for some reason that\'s an anathema to some people. We can subsidize oil companies and private planes but not afford the CPB? Bullshit. '
"the thing with PBS is republicans love to target it because it's a less obvious way to ding education, although with them getting DeVos i'm surprised they even remembered they wanted to break PBS."
'If people want things like this changed, then everyone should watch pbs and listen to npr. If we want legal pot, then we need to go out and petition and vote. We have an unbelievable amount of power to steer the country towards great things but we have to actually show up in numbers, which is the people’s greatest strength'
"Republicans think it's okay to mislead and lie to the public because of the freedom of speech clause in our Constitution.  Just like Trump, the truth and fact checking is their enemy.      "
"Does anybody know what percentage of their budget comes from the government?  Would eliminating that funding really eliminate those networks?\n\n[Edit:  I'm simply asking a question because I don't know the answer.  Please stop downvoting an honest question.  Thank you.]"
'Well yeah, he and his supporters who want him to do this are all fascists. '
'NPR is the only news source I trust. MSNBC has some great programs. CNN has some fantastic journalists. \n\nNPR for me is still miles ahead of both. The other two have opinion pundits that often have good insights into important issues presented with evidence to back up a certain perspective. I wouldn\'t call it spin because it rarely veers into that territory but it still has the "corruption" of emotional entertainment. They have ratings to worry about - and that\'s the nature of television unfortunately. I don\'t fault them for it most of the time. \n\nNPR doesn\'t have that quality. They are (sometimes painfully) objective. They always give multiple perspectives *from other people*. NPR isn\'t giving it\'s opinion its just reporting on the different arguments people involved with the story are making. They\'re just the messenger, the vector through which the facts and opinions are delivered. Even when they\'re delivering it to their own guests. They present those arguments directly to the opposing parties. They don\'t do this for entertainment value. They do it to get the deeper story. '
'This goes hand in hand with the gutting our public education system. '
'How cute, Trump wants only media he approves of, just like Russia and North Korea.'
"I'm Canadian but listen to a ton of NPR podcasts, the quality is terrific and they are about as unbiased as you can get (of course, I can see how conservatives would think otherwise given the fact that reality itself has a liberal bias)."
'>Several years ago, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders explained the crisis in the context of a previous proposal for gutting PBS and NPR funding. His words ring even truer now:\n\n>NPR and PBS… provide some of the highest quality and most objective news reporting in the world. Over the last several decades, as the major broadcasting firms were purchased by corporate conglomerates, support for effective, independent newsrooms has waned. The broadcast news industry, both television and radio, now is vastly transformed. Driven by profits and a 24-hour news cycle, much of the ‘news’ has been dumbed-down and sensationalized and does not reflect the needs of a democracy in which citizens have a right to hear balanced and thoughtful discussion about the most pressing issues facing our nation and the world. The news programming offered by NPR and PBS is the great exception to this trend, and preserving funding for these essential services is necessary to maintaining an honest, lively national debate.”\n\nNuff said.'
'If you truly care about NPR, give during their pledge drives. Or just give. It’s tax deductible. Yes they’re funded by the government, but it’s a shoe string budget. Donations are how you get shows like Fresh Air or  Ask Me Another, and it makes them able to hire people to do the investigative and beat reporting. '

'That was pretty much taken care of by G.W. Bush. Look at the corporate sponsors and the way they perpetuate the climate debate, depite 97% consensus that global warming is real.'
"If any of the threats (more often than leap-years) to defund public broadcasting ever follows through, I want to believe that private donations will spike up high enough to meet the difference. I'm sure it will at least come close, there are too many people who love the services too much to let them dissolve on anyone's whim. \n\nNot saying I want to find out. Please keep giving them money, congress."

'Worth noting this is a *grand jury* subpoena. From the [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/us/politics/steve-bannon-mueller-russia-subpoena.html):\n\n> Prosecutors generally prefer to interview witnesses before a grand jury when they believe they have information that the witnesses do not know or when they think they might catch the witnesses in a lie. It is much easier for a witness to stop the questioning or sidestep questions in an interview than during grand jury testimony, which is transcribed, and witnesses are required to answer every question.'
"[Renato Mariotti](https://twitter.com/renato_mariotti) thread about this.  He's a former federal prosecutor and candidate for AG in Illinois.\n\n>THREAD: Why did Mueller subpoena Bannon to testify before the grand jury?  How is that different from an informal interview with investigators? **(Short answer: He likely wants to question Bannon without Bannon's attorney present.)**\n\n>1/ As @nytimes reported above, Mueller subpoenaed Steve Bannon to testify before the grand jury. He's the first person in Trump's person in Trump's inner circle to be subpoenaed. Other White House staff agreed to be informally interviewed.\n\n>2/ Typically witnesses in an investigation like this one are interviewed informally, especially if they have their own attorney, as Bannon does. So this is a very unusual move.  It could mean a couple of things.\n\n>3/ First, federal prosecutors often will send over a grand jury subpoena as a first step to then negotiate the informal interview. Ultimately the subpoena is the leverage they have to get a subject to comply with an interview.\n\n>4/ I doubt that's what happened here because Bannon is represented by a skilled attorney who also represents Priebus and McGahn, who were already interviewed by Mueller. That means Mueller's team is already in touch with his attorney and has a relationship with him.\n\n>5/ If they called Bannon's attorney, he'd no doubt agree to an interview, because the alternative is a grand jury subpoena.  Why is testifying before the grand jury worse for someone being interviewed? Because their attorney can't be present in the room with them.\n\n>6/ **No one is allowed in the grand jury room other than the witness, the prosecutors, the grand jurors, and the court reporter. Also, the fact that there is a court reporter makes it easier for the prosecutor to charge the witness with making a false statement.**\n\n>7/ Typically, prosecutors also prefer the freewheeling informal interview, because they can ask a broader array of questions in a less tense setting, with a FBI agent present. Often defense lawyers can help their clients remember details by directing them to key documents.\n\n>8/ False statements in an informal interview can be prosecuted, as Papadopoulos and Flynn discovered. Typically the desire to prosecute false statements doesn't drive a decision to issue a grand jury subpoena.\n\n>9/ The most likely reason that Mueller prefers to have Bannon testify before the grand jury is because his attorney won't be present and it will be easier to catch Bannon off-guard and receive truthful answers. Testifying before a grand jury is intimidating.\n\n>10/ When I was a federal prosecutor, I didn't like when multiple witnesses in the same case had the same attorney, even though it was usually permissible. I was worried that the attorney would use their increased knowledge of the case to help the witnesses tailor their testimony.\n\n>11/ Mueller may be concerned that Bannon won't be as candid with his attorney present as he would be with no attorney in front of the grand jury. Grand jury questioning, with a court reporter, also lends itself to a harsher questioning style akin to cross-examination. /end"

'According to the NYT article:\n>The subpoena could be a negotiating tactic. Mr. Mueller is likely to allow Mr. Bannon to forgo the grand jury appearance if he agrees to instead be questioned by investigators in the less formal setting of the special counsel’s offices about ties between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia and about the president’s conduct in office, according to the person, who would not be named discussing the case. **But it was not clear why Mr. Mueller treated Mr. Bannon differently than the dozen administration officials who were interviewed in the final months of last year and were never served with a subpoena.**\n\nInteresting'

'As in other threads, I\'ll tell you what happened when I went through this.\n\nRecap:  I worked for a MAJOR online marketing company.  We were doing half a BILLION dollars a year,  (Google \'iworks\' and \'jeremey johnson\') with a staff of about 30.  When the shit hit the fan the Feds did all the same things to me that they\'re doing to Bannon and company.\n\nI was "invited" to appear before a Grand Jury by two FBI agents about a month after the first indictments came down.  Much like Bannon, I said I\'d rather not.  They responded with a subpoena. \n\nNeedless to say, they are experts at psychological warfare.  It\'s their job to break you mentally, financially, and emotionally.  They visited me at my new job, they called me constantly, and they made it fairly clear that I needed to decide which side I was on- the side that was cooperating, or the side that was going to Federal Prison.\n\nThis was a HUGE case here in Utah- it eventually took down **two** Attorney Generals, and implicated several high-level politicians in a corruption and bribery scheme.  Again, it\'s all online, and it\'s fascinating reading.  Less so when you were right in the middle of it.  But I digress.\n\nSo, since the case was so important, they actually opened up a temporary office in the city where iWorks was located.  A week before I was supposed to appear before the Grand Jury, an FBI agent calls me and says something like "Hey, we know *you* aren\'t the bad-guy here.  No need to interrupt your life.  We\'d just like some... *information.*  Why don\'t you swing by my office, and we\'ll clear this all up?"\n\nSee where this is going?\n\nSo, I drop by their office.  I\'m not bullshitting you here- they had biometric locks on the doors, you had to be buzzed in by camera, and I was searched before the meeting even started.\n\nSo, I sit down at this big table, and aside from me, there\'s the FBI guy, the Salt Lake County DA,  a woman from the DOJ, and three other "minor" attorneys.  You\'d have thought I was Al Capone.\n\nI went in to that meeting thinking I was going to hang tough, invoke my right to remain silent, and demand that my lawyer be present.\n\nI left that meeting having told them everything I knew, clear back to my exit from the womb.  I\'d drawn charts for them on their whiteboard.  I gave them names and phone numbers.  I offered them my harddrive.  I probably would have gotten down and blown them if it meant gaining their approval.\n\nSee, this is *what they do*.  They break people.  It\'s both an art and a science.  They\'ve done it for literally decades, and they\'ve refined it to perfection.  I don\'t care how bad-ass you think you are, if there is *anything* in your life that you care about, they\'ll use it against you.   Not directly, of course.  But trust me, you get the message very quickly.\n\nI never did appear before a Grand Jury.  I didn\'t have to- they knew they\'d wrung me dry.  I didn\'t even have to appear in the subsequent hearings- note I said "hearings", plural, because their were many of them.\n\nIn the end, the bosses went to prison, and are still there today.  It might interest you to know that NONE of them went to jail for fraud, which was the original charge.  The jury found them innocent on all counts of fraud.\n\nThey went to jail for "making false statements to a bank". \nWhen Trump goes down, it won\'t be for the reasons you think.  But he *will* go down. '

'>The president appeared to ease his anger toward Mr. Bannon at the end of last week. When asked in an interview with The Wall Street Journal whether his break with Mr. Bannon was “permanent,” the president replied, “I don’t know what the word ‘permanent’ means.”\n\nI thought he was being figurative when I first read this, like he was saying "I don\'t know the meaning of the word failure" but doesn\'t seem like it... from the interview:\n\n>WSJ: Is that relationship permanently broken between you and Steve?\nMr. Trump: You never know, you know again, the word—– I don’t know what the word permanent means, OK?

They will slink off into the shadows and when the subject is brought up few voices will be heard, save the vitriolic bigots over at The Donald who will undoubtedly insist until the day they die how great his administration was and how he accomplished so many great things despite facts showing otherwise, which they will dismiss as 'fake news' - pretty much as they do now. Any overtly negative things will be countered with 'congress prevented him from doing X'. \n\nAs the man himself says: Sad!"
'And the man with the red hat smiles and cheers.   \n"This is my man, my man," he burbles,  \nAs the illusions become weighty,  \nand the fabrications build fortifications.  \n\nAnd the woman with the red hat giggles and leers,  \n"He\'s got my back, my back," she dribbles,  \nAs the illusions become weighty,  \nand the fabrications build fortifications.\n\nAnd the children with the red hats thunder and smear,  \n"He\'s my hero, my hero," they babble,  \nAs the illusions become weighty,  \nand the fabrications build fortifications.\n\nAs the hats lift and cover and shade and blind.'

According to Stuart Mendel (link is external), director of the Center for Nonprofit Policy & Practice, “[Nonprofits’] whole ability to succeed is based on people's desire to trust them.” In other words, the Trump Foundation scandal will likely reduce trust in the nonprofit sector as a whole—including the most ethical and effective nonprofits and foundations.\n\nTrump has succeeded in helping to erode the trust in news agencies, our foreign allies, our investigative agencies, and now he's chipping away at trust in worthwhile non-profits.

'Fun story for those who are saying "it wont be that bad"\n\nI have comcast. Woke up one morning to an interesting redirect in my web browser, telling me that my device is no longer supported and that i would need to contact comcast to resolve the issue.\n\nAfter about an hour on hold, the comcast rep tells me that my cable modem is no longer supported by comcast because its end of life(although checking their website showed it as a supported modem), so they have turned off my internet to that modem but would be happy to sell me a new modem from them that will be supported for a low monthly fee. \n\nThe modem itself was fine, perfect working condition, but comcast just turned off my internet for literally an entire day to try to shake me down to get me to buy a modem from them. I ended up spending about 6-7 hours on the phone on hold and talking to various reps before i could get them to agree to turn my internet back on, and surprise, my "end of life modem" worked just fine, and continues to work just fine about a year later. \n\nThis was just a straight up shakedown, where they cut off service to a paying customer in order to try to extort more money out of them.\n\nSo yeah, it WILL be that bad. These are companies operating in a borderline monopoly in which their customers have no way of pushing back, so they will do everything they can to screw their customers out of every dime possible.'

Please wait while I access your account.\n\n… Rep: Ma’am, it looks like you only have the basic Internet Services package.\n\nMe: Yeah, same one as last year.\n\nRep: Ma’am, in 2018, we are pleased to tell you we have actually improved our packages to better fit our customer’s needs. Your Basic Services Package covers your local news station and Comcast-approved affiliated websites only. If you wish to access more websites, you will need to upgrade your package to the Social Media, Streaming, or News Packages. If you want all three categories, you will need to upgrade to a VIP package. If you want access to more than 5 categories you will need to upgrade to the All Access Package.\n\nMe: Uh, what?? Why? What do those cost? I want the service I had last year, I didn’t agree to any changes!\n\nRep: I understand ma’am. Your current Basic Services Package is the same price as last year at $79.99/month, each additional package is $9.99/month for unlimited access to the approved category. VIP Packages are an additional $49.99/month and each All Access Package is an additional $129.99/month.\n\nMe: Are you @$*#&$ kidding me? If I want the same service as last year, I have to pay $210/month?! Rep: Yes, ma’am. And its unlimited access, so it really pays for itself the more time you spend on it.\n\nMe: Uh, no…Why is there a change? I refuse to pay more for the same service. Isn’t it illegal to filter access to websites?\n\nRep: Ma’am, I’m pleased to tell you that in December 2017, Ajit Pai and the FCC decided to revoke Net Neutrality rules, allowing us at Comcast to better serve you with these customized packages.

'Today I had a young man tell me that media was all biased because they don’t host the videos he likes on YouTube and that’s against free speech because they don’t like Trump. \n\nI pointed out the trump administration wants to give companies the power to control what content people see - so if he’s against companies controlling what people see then he should be against repealing net neutrality. \n\nAccording to him that’s not the same. Evidently companies should be forced to show the content he likes unless they don’t want to. '
'This is going to get buried, but *The Independent* article here is intellectually dishonest.  Is what Pai and the FCC doing very, very bad?  Yes.  Net neutrality is necessary to a free society in the internet age.  If ISPs can control the media we consume, they will have unprecedented power and influence.  More importantly, freedom of information will be severely lacking\n\n*However*, the FCC is not repealing a "law".  * **There is no Net Neutrality law** *\n\nWhat the FCC is doing is to repeal an Obama era regulation by a simple 3-2 vote.  In contrast, laws can be repealed *only* by votes in both houses of Congress\n\nThis is important for several reasons.  One reason is that the vast majority of regulatory practices the Obama administration began were non-legislative.  They can be repealed simply by having a different president in charge.  Another is that this means net neutrality can be restored if we get a more sympathetic president.  But if we want net neutrality to remain standing, we need a sympathetic Congress - which is far easier said than done.  But *The Independent*\'s phrasing makes the FCC sound legislative and hyperbolizes a very real situation\n\ntl;dr: *The Independent* plays loose with wording, masking the actual situation here'

'>An email from Goldstone to senior Trump aide Dan Scavino, now the White House director of social media, reveals a previously undisclosed topic that was discussed at the meeting. It encourages Scavino to get candidate Trump to create a page on the Russian social networking site VK, telling him that "Don and Paul" were on board with the idea -- a reference to then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump Jr.\n\n>One source says Goldstone pitched the idea to Scavino as a way to connect with the many Russian-Americans who use the site. Another source said Goldstone presented it as a "cute marketing idea" and was passing along the idea for an acquaintance at the Russian social media site.

An attorney for Trump Jr. said his client forwarded a pitch about the concept to Scavino early in the year and could not recall any further discussion about it.\n\n>Scavino did not respond to requests for comment. A White House spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\n>The emails, which were read to The Washington Post and confirmed by people with knowledge of their contents, show a new point of direct contact between an influential Russian and advisers to Trump during the 2016 race.

'Junior is walking himself right into Mueller’s legal landmines. Mueller might not be able to prove “collusion”, but he’s building a solid obstruction case. \n\n The strategy seems rather clear.  In order to get to Trump, he’s got to move up the chain. He started with the low level players (Gate and Papadopolous) and squeezed them to move up to people in the inner circle like Flynn (and I assume Sessions at some point) before finally getting to the Trump family (Kushner and DJTJ).  And Junior is making it VERY easy for Mueller to leverage him. \n\nShit’s getting real. '

'>The U.S. has stated that they will not renegotiate the Paris accord, but they will try to review the terms on which they could be engaged under this agreement\n\n...what does that even mean? They\'re just going to read it over again and be like "Hmm...yeah, sure, why not."?'

'Full Text as of 22:25EST:\n\n>NEW YORK—Trump administration officials said Saturday the U.S. wouldn’t pull out of the Paris Agreement, offering to re-engage in the international deal to fight climate change, according to multiple officials at a global warming summit.\n\n>The U.S. position on reviewing the terms of its participation in the landmark accord came during a meeting of more than 30 ministers led by Canada, China and the European Union in Montreal. In June, President Donald Trump said the U.S. would withdraw from the deal unless it could find more favorable terms.\n\n>U.S. officials in Montreal, led by White House senior adviser Everett Eissenstat, broached revising U.S. climate-change goals, two participants said, signaling a compromise that would keep the U.S. at the table even if it meant weakening the international effort. Still, the move would maintain international unity behind the painstakingly negotiated Paris accord, after Mr. Trump suggested he might seek a new agreement.\n\n>“The U.S. has stated that they will not renegotiate the Paris accord, but they will try to review the terms on which they could be engaged under this agreement,” European Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy  Miguel Arias Cañete  said.\n\n>In a statement Saturday afternoon, a White House spokeswoman said the administration’s position on Paris had not changed, but also noted that the president’s stance on withdrawing from the deal had never been set in stone.\n\n>“There has been no change in the U.S.’s position on the Paris agreement,” said deputy press secretary  Lindsay Walters. “As the president has made abundantly clear, the U.S. is withdrawing unless we can re-enter on terms that are more favorable to our country.”\n\n>Multiple participants at the Montreal gathering said Mr. Eissenstat’s approach, though it is likely to entail a significant reduction in the U.S.’s ambition to curb greenhouse-gas emissions, fueled optimism among proponents of the Paris deal. Since Mr. Trump’s inauguration in January, officials from China to the EU and Canada have tried to convince his administration that fighting climate change is also a boon for the economy and jobs, and not just an ideological battle.\n\n>“We are pleased the U.S. continues to engage and recognize the economic opportunity of clean growth, including clean energy,” said Canadian Environment Minister Catherine McKenna in a statement to The Wall Street Journal.\n\n>In announcing the decision to withdraw the U.S. from the 195-nation agreement at the White House in June, Mr. Trump said he was ready to “begin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris accord or an—really entirely new transaction—on terms that are fair to the U.S., its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.”\n\n>“So we’re getting out, but we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair,” he added. “And if we can, that’s great. And if we can’t, that’s fine.”\n\n>The U.S. has the world’s second highest level of greenhouse-gas emissions, which drive global warming, behind China. Washington’s exit from the Paris deal would undermine its viability and could trigger other exits, unraveling an agreement that took decades to negotiate.\n\n>Washington is reviewing new emission-cut targets to combat climate change, Mr. Eissenstat said, according to one of the participants at the meeting. Any revisions would lower existing U.S. commitments signed by former President  Barack Obama, which would be a blow to the global effort, the official said. Under the Paris accord, every country set its own goals.\n\n>While Mr. Eissenstat, deputy assistant to the president for international economic affairs and deputy director of the National Economic Council, outlined a plan to reassure partners that the U.S. would be constructive, he did not provide clarity on the new emissions-reduction objectives, the official said. The National Economic Council is led by  Gary Cohn, Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser.\n\n>“They are seriously considering the terms on which the U.S. could re-engage,” the official said. “They have also made clear that they have no intention to renegotiate or develop a parallel track to Paris.”\n\n>Mr. Cohn is expected to reiterate Mr. Eissenstat’s message in Montreal during an informal breakfast meeting to discuss international energy and climate issues with the world’s top ministers, the official said.\n\n>Canada, China and the EU organized the ministerial meeting in Montreal just before world leaders descend on New York for the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n>Signed in 2015 under a U.N. effort to fight climate change, the Paris deal is also on the agenda as countries seek to meet their global commitment to limit the global temperature increases to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with preindustrial levels. The only countries that aren’t signatories to the accord are Syria and Nicaragua.\n\n>Some major U.S. energy companies, including  Exxon Mobil Corp . , had urged Mr. Trump not to withdraw from the Paris accord. Exxon Chief Executive  Darren Woods  went public earlier this year with his point of view that the U.S. should remain in the agreement.\n\n>Some players in the energy industry, including the chiefs of some shale companies, supported the move to leave the Paris Accord.\n\n>Whether or not the U.S. opts to stay, the country’s emissions of greenhouse gases are widely predicted to continue declining, as gas power replaces coal, helped by bountiful supplies of cheap natural gas. The declining cost of renewable power, including wind and solar, is also forecast to play a role in reducing emissions.\n\n>When Mr. Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris in June, executives at many U.S. companies, in the energy sector and beyond, signaled that they intended to continue taking steps to reduce emissions by their companies.\n\n>States and cities around the U.S. also vowed to adhere to their own aggressive climate policies, independent of the federal government.'
"Also I'd better not be hit with another round of articles gushing about how Trump's a third party president now. If he's serious about moderating, he should fire his entire cabinet save Mattis and replace them with people who actually want to serve the department they head."
"This is such a dumb political move by Trump. His recent left swing will alienate many of his hard core supporters. The last support he has left. On the other hand it will be impossible for him to win over people on the left. What does he think he's doing. I'm very curious about the next round of approval rating polls."
'WH response to article: "As the President has made abundantly clear, the US is withdrawing unless we can re-enter on terms more favorable to our country."'
'First he said:\n\n"In order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect the United States and its citizens, the United States WILL WITHDRAW from the Paris climate accord"\n\nNow he says:\n\n"The United States is withdrawing UNLESS we can re-enter on terms that are more favorable to our country”\n\nAnd here\'s the truth:\n\nIn accordance with Article 28 of the Paris Agreement, the earliest possible effective withdrawal date by the United States cannot be before November 4, 2020, four years after the Agreement came into effect in the United States and one day after the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[5]\n\nThis whole back and forth is smoke and mirrors. He can\'t pull us out unless he wins in 2020 too, and I bet he just figured that out so he\'s trying to save face by pretending that he\'s gonna do some masterful negotiating and then CHOOSE to stay. In reality we\'re staying no matter what he does this term.'
'"WTF I love the Paris climate deal now."\n\n- trump supporters.'
"This bolsters the groups that call things like this fake news. Despite the article saying >“There has been no change in the U.S.’s position on the Paris agreement,” said deputy press secretary\xa0 Lindsay Walters. “As the president has made abundantly clear, the U.S. is withdrawing unless we can re-enter on terms that are more favorable to our country.”\n\nWhich basically is restating Trump's administration's original position is that we are withdrawing unless we renegotiate better terms. How is this shocking to anyone???"
'Is he going to get on TV next week and say something like "you know, I tried that Republican stuff for the past eight months, I gave it a chance, I really did. I really tried hard at it, I did the best job at it, but you know, it\'s just not working out. I promised winning and this has not been winning. So I\'m gonna be a Democrat for a little while and see how that goes."'
'Paris climate accords are only worth something if a government actually takes it commitments seriously. And in that sense I respect Trumps commitment to withdraw from the Paris agreement more then that I can respect Saudi Arabia, Russia or even Australia staying in the agreement while not doing much at all.\n\nPerhaps this signals a change that they will start take it seriously. But ultimately actions will speak far louder then words and I for example seriously doubt Pruitt will change his tune.'
'"The climate and environmental minister Vidar Helgesen (H), who attends the Montreal meeting, also rejects the NRK that the United States has reversed the Paris agreement.\n\n"Unfortunately, it\'s not true that the United States has turned. The position the United States has repeated today is that the United States may remain in the agreement if they get better conditions. But a re-negotiation, we are all clear that is not relevant, so it\'s not really as much news as the EU Commissioner has expressed, "said Helgesen, on the phone from Canada.\n\nHelgesen says he wishes the United States to return to the Paris agreement at any time. The United States is still at the table, since it takes several years to withdraw from the agreement.\n\n"There are constructive signals and positive participation from the United States, it is good and can hope that they will come to better conclusions eventually. But they have not yet come to a turnaround, "said the Minister for the Environment and the Environment."'
'Reuters says "The United States attended a Saturday meeting of ministers from more than 30 of the nations that signed the Paris climate-change agreement, though the White House issued a statement saying it will stick with plans to pull out of the deal.

"These latest moves by him are really reinforcing my belief about what is actually going on behind the scenes with Mueller.  I think while the trump campaign looked fishy, the investigation uncovered an RNC corruption that is about to destroy the republican party and he as well as the Dems know this so he's making a play for the moderate side of the RNC and dems to make his own second party when the RNC implodes.  Think back to beginning of Obama when it was leaked that the Tea party was being unfairly targetted by the IRS, I really think the far right part of the RNC is corrupt and is about to go down.  Also explains why the Moderates are all retiring and those figures a few weeks back where the RNC funds on hand was literally 5-6x more than the DNC.  RNC is filled with laundered money.  "

When he does go, he will blame everyone else, saying that they told him what was best to do. Some people will lap this up and that will be enough for him.'
"I am encouraged by this. But don't be fooled into thinking Trump is being bipartisan here. All he's done is take Obama-era programs and pledge to end them, then put them back into place in a bald-faced attempt to take credit for them.\n\nIf you can't erase the black man's legacy; you might as well take credit for it."

And the obvious tell that it's eating him will be even more lashing out on Twitter and leaks from the White House that he has devolved into watching Fox News in his tighty whities, if that wasn't the case all along it's just, like, at first you can tell yourself the stress is getting to the guy, but like, we been at this a year and change now.

And so I told the president of Russia whatever his name is, I haven't met him, he should see our navy, that way he won't wanna mess with us. So I showed him our navy and he was very impressed. Very impressed. I showed him everything so I don't think we'll have much trouble from them from now on.

'~~I was actually surprised to learn how infrequently Trump has granted pardons. This will only be his fifth one. Most recent presidents have granted on the order of hundreds.~~ It\'s like he\'s just disregarding all other applications for clemency and only granting "big name" ones to send political messages.\n\nEdit: I was looking at data on [DoJ\'s site](https://www.justice.gov/pardon/clemencyrecipients) all wrong. He\'s definitely pardoning at a higher pace than other presidents\' first year and a half to two years. Now I\'m less (not) surprised :(. Obama, Bush 43, and Clinton didn\'t pardon anyone till the end of their second years. Again the difference though is their earliest ones were almost all for minor offences whereas Trump is doling them out as political messaging to his allies to stick with him.'
"When Clinton pardoned a political ally, he did it on his way out.  Literally in his last days of his presidency.  Why?  Because pardoning political allies is a really shady thing to do.  Doing it in the middle of your presidency is outright alarming.  Doing it at all is pretty shady to begin with.  Trump just openly pardons people who happen to like him like Arpaio and D'Souza and people who did shady things for previous administrations like Libby.  Nothing matters anymore, open corruption, favoritism and backscratching is quickly becoming the new norm."
'From Wiki: On September 23, 2014, he was sentenced to eight months in a halfway house near his home in San Diego, five years probation, and a $30,000 fine.\n\nAnother instance where a pardon isn’t necessary for some sort of actual relief and is just a way to prove to his cronies that he’ll pardon anyone that gets in trouble for breaking the law.

'This is a complete mockery of the US justice system. This is a lawyer, who admitted he knew the campaign finance law, admitted he broke campaign finance law and got the following sentence:\n\n > D\'Souza was sentenced to spend an eight-hour day each week in community service as part of a five-year probationary term,\xa0according to the Southern District of New York. He also had to attend weekly counseling sessions and pay a $30,000 fine\n\nThis is barely a slap on the wrist, this guy\'s net worth is [4 million] (https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/authors/dinesh-dsouza-net-worth/). A 30,000 fine might as well be a parking ticket and the community service/counseling is comparable to what I\'ve seen people get for possession of a joint. So, understanding how lax his sentencing was Trump *still* felt the need to pardon this guy of all people. Knowing all of that, his lackey (Ted Cruz) still had the gall to say:\n\n> Bravo! @realDonaldTrump Dinesh was the subject of a political prosecution, brazenly targeted by the Obama administration bc of his political views. And he’s a powerful voice for freedom, systematically dismantling the lies of the Left—which is why they hate him. This is Justice. \n\nIt should be noted that this guy (D\'Souza) is also a brazen propagandist with gems such as "Hillary\'s America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party" and "Democratic Left Are the \'Real\' Fascists in US -- Not Trump" in his filmography...'
"Disgusting. The pardoning power of Presidents has to be *vastly* curtailed. Presidents should not be able to pardon people associated with an investigation they're party to, and should not be able to pardon political allies.

"More importantly, pardoning doesn't do shit about the possibility of being removed from office."
'Can you imagine the wording of any pardon he came up with?\n"I, Donald J. Trump, hereby declare myself pardoned of any crime I may have committed, but I didn\'t commit any crime, because I\'m innocent, and only THE DEMS say otherwise - Total witch hunt! SAD! But I pardon myself because I\'m a very forgiving guy. Actually the most forgiving. Not that there\'s anything to forgive - the country\'s doing BETTER THAN EVER so it\'s not even a pardon - it\'s lies - you can check; top, top legal people confirm this (the best) - because you can\'t pardon nothing, but it is and I do."'
'I’ll say it again: why would Trump want to pardon himself, if he is not guilty? '
"I've had more than a few conversations with conservatives defending his decision to pardon himself. Pardon himself for which crimes exactly? Which ones is he admitting guilt for? Weren't you fuckers saying lock her up 20 minutes ago?"
'1. This is an opinion piece in the WaPo. In my experience, their opinion section is absolute garbage as far as conveying truthful information is concerned. \n\n2. The opinion piece is labeling as fact, something that is not settled law. The case cited, Burdick, if you read it, does indeed have the words "imputation of guilt" in it. But this is not the same as the case standing for that principle. One thing to know when reading court cases is the difference between a holding, and dicta. A holding is what the case stands for. It is absolute.  A dicta is like an aside, a hypothetical point, or a non-crucial statement in the opinion. While dicta are very persuasive, they are not binding on subsequent court decisions. \n\nIn the Burdick case, the opinion states as as a supporting fact that a pardon carries with it an imputation of guilt.  But this isn\'t part of the actual holding, or indeed crucial to the argument. A court evaluating the question of whether a pardon is an admission of guilt will consider this evidence, but they will also consider other factors, such as the current usage of the pardon, both in the states, and federally.  For example, many state criminal codes contemplate a pardon issued to someone who is wrongly convicted. The federal statutes surrounding the pardon do not require the person submitting the request to admit guilt upon submission. \n\nThere are a whole lot of facets of modern pardon law that this article ignores by citing a dicta from a 1915 case. \n\nI\'m not saying that Trump can pardon X person with no consequences, or that he should. (There would be fifth amendment consequences for instance). I\'m simply saying that before you get excited about pardon law as presented by the WaPo opinion section, you should realize it isn\'t actually that simple. '
"Even his statements on pardoning himself allude to him being guilty of something. He said he isn't above the law but could pardon himself but won't because he hasn't done anything wrong. So if he does pardon himself it is because he's done something wrong? Doesn't that make it so he IS above the law???"
'4D Chess master right? Regardless it\'s amazing how low the standard is for a cult of personality. \n\n\nI\'ve always been "accepting of other political beliefs" until they actually nominated this clown.

"If Trump pardons himself and thereby legally admits guilt to impeachable offenses, I *still* don't think the current Republican Congress will impeach him. As long as he continues to enjoy 80%+ support among Republican voters, a legal admission of obstruction doesn't change the political calculus at all. The only thing that makes a difference is if *public opinion* changes - specifically, *Republican* public opinion. And that won't happen with something as lawyerly and unexciting as obstruction. Fox News can just say obstruction doesn't matter (except when Democrats do it, of course)."
"Doesn't this ever make you wonder if these things aren't planned in advance? That folks in Trump's position aren't assured they'll be ok, no matter how the narrative of their power/corruption plays out? We're locked in this desire to see him go down when, impeachment or not, he's unlikely to ever face any real consequences for his actions...George W. was reviled, and now he's a painter living in relative silence. Obama is well regarded, but his tenure had its skeletons too... and Clinton, and the the rest of them. I dunno... maybe reading all that Jean Baudrillard while my ex was watching House of Cards made me irrevocably cynical when it comes to politicians. How outlandish is it, really, that presidents know what they're getting into from the start? You play a hero, or a villain, to serve the national agenda-- and then you fade into the sunset, if reviled, taken care of and protected for the rest of your life, no matter what atrocities are committed in your name...\n\nWhether I'm full of it or on teh [sic] money-- Ugh, politics! amiright?"
'Doesn\'t seem like he cares about the optics, or anything else, of an admission of guilt. He just needs to know he can "get away with it". Like shooting someone in Time Square and not being punished. Or shooting Comey and not be indicted. Seems like dictatorial elitism to me. At the very least it\'s dysfunctional imperialism. Either way, it\'s all bad for America. IMPEACH TODAY!'
"After Trump's abuses we really need to review presidential pardon power. It has the capacity to do enormous good, but it clearly needs some form of review or limitation, specifically to prevent what Trump keeps threatening to do.\n\nMaybe it should be modified into a sentence commutation power? That way it could still effectively work like a pardon in justified cases, but we remove this ridiculous notion that the president is a king who can magically wipe\\-away a conviction. I know that's not what a pardon is, but that's definitely what most people think it is."

'1. I think you are getting into a circular argument.  If he uses the pardon power on himself it means he *was* guilty of an impeachable crime. Because he was pardoned he is therefore not prosecutable under said crime without the Supreme Court clarifying Article 2, Section 2, further.\n2.  Just because *Burdick* is good law doesn\'t mean it isn\'t old law and won\'t be upheld.  It was also *dicta* and not part of the holding of the case.  So you could say that *Burdick* is still valid (you can refuse a presidential pardon) but the *dicta* of an "imputation of guilt* was incorrect.\n1. You would have to bring up new charges and more importantly *prove it*.  Trump, like Clinton, seems to be successful in turning this into a partisan issue so even if there is a "blue wave" to start the impeachment in the House, there won\'t be enough Democrats in the best case scenario to convict in the Senate.  (Democrats would be dancing to win the majority in the Senate and even that is unlikely...let alone winning all their races and still coming up short).\n3. Democrats bringing an impeachment without the votes to convict would repeat the Republicans mistake.  Mass disapproval and a perception of being "innocent" of the charges by most people.\n\n\nI think it makes Democrats/liberals feel good to make this legal argument but the practical effect is trivial and the legal outcome uncertain.  The audacity that Trump would pardon himself would be the actionable trigger that would probably bring a court case or impeachment.  Even R. Giuliani, his head lawyer,  agreed this would be a likely ramification.'

Raids need high-level approval at the department.\n\n>“Whenever the government grabs attorney-client privileged materials, they have opened a hornet’s nest of problems in prosecuting a case,” said Seth Taube, an attorney at Baker Botts LLP. “If the government winds up seeing privileged materials, it could blow up a case, because any evidence you get from privileged materials means that anything else related to that is the fruit of the poisoned tree.”\n\n>To avoid such a danger, the Justice Department creates a **“taint team”** of lawyers not involved in the case to review records and decide which ones shouldn’t be seen by prosecutors on the case.\n\nif this is related to the stormy daniels affair there will be a ***Stormy Daniels Taint Team***'

That\'s what she wanted her life to be, and she accomplished it. There was no expectation of marital loyalty on either side of the contract, no real emotions. Just beauty on one side and money on the other.

'A lot of countries do have a similar type of visa, and it\'s probably more accurate to describe them as "extraordinary ability and/or relative fame and wealth".  Applicants must meet at least 3 out of 10 criteria. [These criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EB-1_visa#Eligibility_Criteria) mostly imply a high degree of achievements in fields that aren\'t necessarily experiencing a shortage of labour.\n\n In any case, some of the criteria seems to make it easier to include people like Melania, i.e. people who arguably aren\'t that important but are 1) somewhat recognizable by the public (at least in their niche fields) 2) quite well-off financially:\n\n* Evidence of high salary or other significantly high remuneration in relation to others in the field \n* Evidence of commercial successes in the performing arts\n\nSo those two options could have easily applied to her, which would mean there was just one additional criterion that needed to be met and I\'m sure would be easy enough to prove for someone in her position at the time. \n\n*edit: typo*'

Still, we assembled a package of references, from professors and co-workers, that successfully made the case. Though my path was based on research, I'm sure the same kinds of arguments can be made for non-academic fields.\n \nAs in many other things, this is simply an example of those with the means making the system work for them.

'[The Foreign Policy article cited within this one provides a bit more information.](http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/26/trump-launched-campaign-to-discredit-potential-fbi-witnesses/)\n\n>President Donald Trump pressed senior aides last June to devise and carry out a campaign to discredit senior FBI officials after learning that those specific employees were likely to be witnesses against him as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, according to two people directly familiar with the matter.\n\nThe senior officials that Trump allegedly targeted include:\n>Andrew McCabe, the current deputy FBI director and who was briefly acting FBI director after Comey’s firing\n\n#\n\n>Jim Rybicki, Comey’s chief of staff and senior counselor; and James Baker, formerly the FBI’s general counsel\n\n#\n\n>James Baker, formerly the FBI’s general counsel\n\nIt\'s clear that Trump conducted a campaign to discredit the FBI, however neither of these articles detail exactly what Trump had his staff do.\n\nTwo anonymous sources are cited.  If they are able to provide more information to Mueller and his team beyond "There was a smear campaign", it would be much easier to prove intent in an obstruction of justice case.\n\n>That Trump may have been motivated to attack specific FBI officials because they were potential witnesses against him could demonstrate potential intent that would bolster an obstruction of justice case. \n\nMy hope is that these sources can give more information to the special counsel investigation.'
'These are definitely the actions of an innocent person. '
'“Some people witnessed me trying to obstruct the investigation into my obstruction of justice. Guess I’d better discredit them to obstruct justice.” - Trump, apparently.'
"Man Trump is dumb. He just can't stop fucking himself, it's like he wants to commit the best, greatest bigly obstruction of justice in the history of a long long time, believe me."
"Dear Trump Enablers,\n\nYou're only safe so long as he finds you useful.  And even then you're probably fucked.\n\nPS:  This also applies to Trump supporters, but I'm sure you'll be singing his praises until the very moment it's *your* house he's burning down."
"Because that's how the GOP rolls.  Attack families, hero soldiers, children, minorities, FBI agents, but support neo-nazis and the rich. "
'We should always take Trump’s behavior as a whole.

(Huh? How is this a disqualifying factor) \n\n- Mueller was interviewed for the position of FBI director? (Again, wtf) \n\n- An FBI agent attended a Hillary Clinton Event so now he’s an agent of Hillary because that’s how things work in Trump’s Head, kind of like, if you were ever at a Trump rally then you’re forever for Trump and his policies. \n\nHave you ever attended a Trump rally? \nOh no now you have Trump stamp \n\n\n\n'

' Mike Pompeo is a disaster of a human being, he\'s a Koch brother lackey and probably the most corrupt and unethical congressman of the U.S.\n\n "Mike Pompeo is an extremist who stokes fears of Muslims and talks of executing Edward Snowden.\r\n\nIn the “Republican Wave” election of 2010, when brothers Charles and David Koch emerged as defining figures in American politics,\xa0the greatest beneficiary\xa0of Koch Industries largess was the newly elected Congressman Mike Pompeo. Since his election, Pompeo has been referred to as the “Koch Brothers’ Congressman” and “the congressman from Koch.”\r\n\n "Pompeo, who on Friday accepted President-elect Donald Trump’s invitation to take over as director of the Central Intelligence Agency, is a foreign-policy hawk who has fiercely opposed the Iran nuclear deal, stoked fears of Muslims in the United States and abroad, opposed closing the Guantánamo Bay detention camp, and defended\xa0the National Security Agency’sunconstitutional\xa0surveillance programs as “good and important work.”\xa0\n\r\n "He has even gone so far as to\xa0say\xa0that NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden “should be brought back from Russia and given due process, and I think the proper outcome would be that he would be given a death sentence.”\r\n\n" Pompeo built his own company with\xa0seed money\xa0from Koch Venture Capital.\r\nCongressman Mike Pompeo was the single largest recipient of campaign funds from the Koch Brothers in 2010.

We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election.

'I just re-watched the Trump/Putin presser and something occurred to me - when asked if he would denounce Putin and Russia\'s attack, he said, essentially "Coats told me Russia did it, Putin is right here, he told me they did not." I think, essentially, he doesn\'t internalize or understand evidence or analysis (mainly because he\'s functionally illiterate), he believes people who he wants to believe because they agree with him or flatter him. And he only pays attention to or understands about 10% of what is verbally communicated to him, at best. For Trump, the decision of what to say in that press conference comes down to "Does Trump like Dan Coats or Putin more"? And the answer is - of course - Trump dislikes Coats because he takes away all of Trump\'s triumphant glorious election win by talking about Russian election influence, while Putin says Trump is the most great and powerful president in all of American history - and your hands your hands are so very extremely large and ow, that handshake, it just crushes me, you are such a big strong president.

"and\n\n11/10/2016 - Obama warns Trump about Flynn\n\n11/18/2016 - Trump names Flynn National Security Advisor\n\nref: https://themoscowproject.org/collusion-timeline\n\nLieutenant General (ret.) Michael Flynn resigned from his position as national Security advisor after it was revealed that he lied about having direct contact with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the campaign. U.S. intelligence officials believe that Flynn illicitly led the Russian ambassador to “expect a reprieve from sanctions” from the incoming Trump administration. On several occasions during the campaign and transition, Flynn allegedly privately discussed U.S. policies toward Russia,\nincluding sanctions, with Kislyak, and he later lied to the public and the FBI about the nature of these discussions. Flynn has denied that he discussed sanctions with Kislyak. **Flynn met with Kislyak on an social visit to Moscow in 2013, during which he became the first U.S. officer to enter GRU (Russian military intelligence) headquarters**. Flynn traveled to Moscow in December 2015 to attend a gala dinner hosted by Russia’s state-sponsored media giant, RT, where he sat at the same table as Vladimir Putin. He was reportedly paid $45,000 to attend this event. Flynn’s son is also reportedly under investigation, with a focus on the lobbying work he completed for his father’s lobbying firm Flynn Intel Group. On **November 5, 2017**, multiple sources reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team believe they have sufficient evidence to bring charges against both Flynn and his son as part of the ongoing investigation into alleged collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russian government officials. ref: https://themoscowproject.org/players/michaelflynn/\n\n**December 1, 2017**: Michael Flynn pleads guilty to making false statements to FBI agents.\n\n**July 10, 2018**: In the seven months since Flynn pleaded guilty, it’s unclear what assistance he’s provided to prosecutors. The special counsel’s office has not cited him as a witness in court papers so far. But it’s clear prosecutors believed he could be valuable enough to cut him a more favorable deal. In his plea agreement, he admitted to acting as an unregistered foreign agent for Turkey, a federal crime, but he wasn’t charged with the violation. Flynn is not the only person from Trump’s team who agreed to cooperate with the special counsel’s office. Rick Gates, the Trump campaign’s former deputy chairman, pleaded guilty in February. His sentencing has not been scheduled. ref: Judge again delays sentencing for Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security advisor\n\n**July 13, 2018**: The Special Counsel indicts **12 members of Russian military intelligence, known as the GRU**, for engaging in a sustained effort to hack the computer networks of Democratic organizations and the Hillary Clinton campaign. Count 1 Conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, Counts 2 -9 Aggravated identity theft, Count 10 Conspiracy to launder money, Count 11 Conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States. (Period from 2015-2016)\n\nThe indictment tells us \n\n>The hacking and coordinated release of stolen emails is what collusion looks like. The sequence of events offers a clear case study in how the two campaigns to elect Donald Trump—one based in Trump Tower and one based in Russia—colluded.\n\n> 1 - Russia wanted to help Trump and used its intelligence and espionage tools to illegally hack the DNC and the Clinton campaign.\n\n>2 - The Trump campaign also wanted Russia’s help to get the “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. They were willing to work with a foreign intelligence service hostile to the United States to defeat their political opponent.\n\n>3 - These two campaigns then met and coordinated. And when Russia chose to use WikiLeaks to anonymously release the stolen emails, the Trump campaign sought to communicate with WikiLeaks as well.\n\n>4 - The email releases were timed to provide maximum benefit to Trump.\n\n>5 - Trump then made the email releases central to his campaign strategy in the final month. \n\n>Combining Russia’s espionage capabilities with the Trump campaign’s unique and granular understanding of the American political landscape, especially its data-targeting expertise, would have greatly aided both campaigns. The two campaigns met and conversed repeatedly for months, providing ample opportunity to hammer out a strategy to amplify each others’ messages to increase Trump’s chances in the election. The question now is no longer whether there was collusion; it is how deep the\ncollusion went. ref: https://cdn.themoscowproject.org/content/uploads/2018/05/17084235/Collusion-Case-Study-Report-5.17.pdf"

"Yglesias' points are all well taken. The system of government described in the memo would clearly not be what the founding fathers intended, and it would be unconstitutional, given that the President is instructed in the constitution to 'faithfully execute the laws'. However, what's lacking in the essay is a description of how the other branches of government can effectively check a President who believes such an exercise of the office is permitted. Impeachment is not a remedy (how to argue that a exercise of executive decisions is unconstitutional or unlawful when the decisions are within the purview of unitary executive discretion).  \n\nWhat is the actual mechanism of enforcement if the 'independence' of the Justice Department is only an illusion, a 'norm'. It may be that there are real constitutional problems with the idea of trying to fix the practical mechanism by statute. However, because the judicial branch oversees the integrity of the courts, and prosecutorial behavior is a matter of appeal, I would think that the Supreme Court would have the final say and can impose a remedy. It seems like there needs to be specific details developed to formalize a remedy in the practical day-to-day sense because norms just aren't going to cut it anymore. On the other hand, to abandon the spirit of the law because it no longer has any power, and ask for protection from tyranny with just the letter, that's a kind of decay. It won't end well either."

'Whenever I read about the things Trump does, and the reaction from the current Republican party and its followers, I can\'t help but think of a quote from Loki in the Marvel Thor movies:\n\n*"Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It’s the unspoken truth of humanity that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life’s joy in a mad scramble for power. For identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel."*\n\nAs I try to think of something that better encapsulates how I view the modern day Trump supporting Republican, I can\'t think of one that fits it more than this. I know that a lot of people immediately think of some racist, slobbering and raging drunk redneck screaming about kicking anyone who doesn\'t look like them off their soil, but this is what I see more than anything else. \n\nLook at what\'s happening to our government. Our president has filled each department with people who often have only the qualification of being his rich friend, supporter or being related to him. His lawyer has been paid inordinate amounts of money from people who have then later directly benefited from decisions his government has made at the cost of our own personal freedoms. He is single handedly crippling the blue collar job market in the Midwest, on purpose, with tariffs that he and his will reap the rewards of. And he has now stated, unequivocally, that he is beyond reproach and beyond the reach of the law in doing any of this. \n\nOne by one he has taken dumps on every major and respected member of the Republican party, on the NRA, on gun owners, and on blue collar steel/coal/etc workers throughout the country. He has changed the tax laws to specifically reward himself and his friends at the cost of those very same blue collar workers he has just screwed. And every facet of the way that he carries himself in his personal life is a direct affront to the religious right, going down breaking each of the 10 commandments like a checklist.\n\nThis man, on paper, should be the single worst nightmare of the GOP. He would be the very anti-Christ that they accused Obama of being. \n\nSo, how do they react in the fact of their natural enemy? Throughoutall of this, what have the Republicans done? Cheered. *Good for him, taking control of the country! Good for him, stepping on us to better himself and his friends! Who needs due process when it comes to taking guns; why did we ever think that was important? He\'s obviously a godly man despite how he lives his life! Why did we ever support Law enforcement, knowing that one day they might investigate our master?! To hell with the FBI, and it\'s war-hero church attending special counsel! Walk on me more, my lord, and ignore those crybabies who scream about outdated concepts like "freedom".*\n\nI can\'t help but feel like these people WANT to be subjugated. They WANT to kneel. A far cry from the Republican party I grew up with.\n\nI feel like the era of the "Don\'t Tread On Me" conservative has died, and has been replaced with "Step On Me More, Please"'

'> Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein visited the White House in December seeking President Donald Trump\'s help. The top Justice Department official in the Russia investigation wanted Trump\'s support in fighting off document demands from House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes.\n\n> \n> But the President had other priorities ahead of a key appearance by Rosenstein on the Hill, according to sources familiar with the meeting. Trump wanted to know where the special counsel\'s Russia investigation was heading. And he wanted to know whether Rosenstein was "on my team."\n\nTrump also refers to the DOJ as "his Justice Department." He literally thinks that they are his personal goon squad.'
'Has there ever been a more far reaching attempt to obstruct justice? Seems like all avenues.'
"Trump just fundamentally refuses to operate within the basis of American government, and Rosenstein does not.\n\nWhen Trump asks Rosenstein if he's on Trump's team, Trump is asking if Rosenstein serves Trump.\n\nRosenstein knows this but answers the question as if Trump is honoring his office. Both are sworn to defend and uphold the Constitution, so of course they are on the same team.\n\nProblem is that Trump saw his oath of office as something similar to the flag salute, which is just a bunch of words you say before school starts. He views himself as an absolute ruler plagued by disloyal subordinates, including the justice department, the court system, and potentially Congress.\n\nThere is a reason why American government officials pledge to defend the Constitution.\n\nThe reason is people like Trump."
'If you break it down, it\'s a pretty strong implication—what did Trump mean by "on my team?" What are the interests of his team he felt Rosenstein might night have been aligned with, and he had to question him about?'

Impeachment should be decided by the Supreme Court or some other (relatively) neutral party.

'[Full Schiff Statement:](https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=361)\n\n-\n\n> “Today, the House Majority has announced it is terminating the Russia investigation, leaving to others the important work of determining the full extent of Russian interference in our election, the role of U.S. persons connected to the Trump campaign in that intervention, possible efforts to obstruct the investigation by the President and most important, what needs to be done to protect the country going forward. While the Majority members of our committee have indicated for some time that they have been under great pressure to end the investigation, it is nonetheless another tragic milestone for this Congress, and represents yet another capitulation to the executive branch. By ending its oversight role in the only authorized investigation in the House, the Majority has placed the interests of protecting the President over protecting the country, and history will judge its actions harshly.\n\n-\n\n> “Next week, it will be one year since our investigation began with its first open hearing, and the country learned that the Trump campaign had been the subject of a counterintelligence investigation since July of the election year. Since that time, we have learned a great deal about countless secret meetings, conversations and communications between Trump campaign officials and the Russians, all of which the Trump Administration initially denied, would later misrepresent, and finally be forced to acknowledge. Thirteen Russians have been indicted in a far reaching conspiracy in which the Russians sought to influence our election by helping Donald Trump, hurting the Hillary Clinton campaign and sowing discord in the United States. Most significant, high-ranking Trump campaign and Administration officials have also been indicted, including the President’s national security advisor, his campaign chair and deputy campaign chair, as well as one of his foreign policy advisors, and three of those have already pled guilty.\n\n-\n\n> “During that first open hearing of our investigation, I asked whether we could conduct this investigation in the kind of thorough and nonpartisan manner that the seriousness of the issues merited, or whether the enormous political consequences of our work would make that impossible. At that time, I said that I did not know the answer, but ‘if this committee can do its work properly, if we can pursue the facts wherever they lead, unafraid to compel witnesses to testify, to hear what they have to say, to learn what we will and, after exhaustive work, reach a common conclusion, it would be a tremendous public service and one that is very much in the national interest.’\n\n-\n\n> “Regrettably, that challenge proved too much. The Majority was not willing to pursue the facts wherever they would lead, would prove afraid to compel witnesses like Steve Bannon, Hope Hicks, Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump Jr., Corey Lewandowski and so many others to answer questions relevant to our investigation. It proved unwilling to subpoena documents like phone records, text messages, bank records and other key records so that we might determine the truth about the most significant attack on our democratic institutions in history. Instead, it began a series of counter-investigations, designed to attack the credibility of the FBI, the Departments of Justice and State, and investigate anyone and anything other than what they were charged to do — investigate Russia’s interference in our election and the role the Trump campaign played. Ironically, even while they close down the Russia investigation, they plan to continue trying to put our own government on trial: this is a great service to the President, and a profound disservice to the country.\n\n-\n\n>“Some will say that we should leave the investigation to Special Counsel Mueller anyway, since he has the resources and independence to do the job. But this fundamentally misapprehends the mission of the Special Counsel, which is to determine whether U.S. laws were broken and who should be prosecuted.  It is not Mueller’s job to tell the American people what happened, that is our job, and the Majority has walked away from it. Others may be tempted to say a pox on both houses, and suggest that in a dispute between the parties, both must be equally culpable. But after months of urging the Majority to do a credible investigation, the Minority was put in the position of going along with a fundamentally unserious investigative process, or pointing out what should be done, what must be done, to learn the truth. We chose the latter course.\n\n-\n\n> “On a fundamental aspect of our investigation — substantiating the conclusions of the Intelligence Community’s assessment that the Russians interfered in our democracy to advance the Trump campaign, hurt Clinton and sow discord — we should have been able to issue a common report. On those issues, the evidence is clear and overwhelming that the Intelligence Community Assessment was correct. On a whole host of investigative threads, our work is fundamentally incomplete, some issues partially investigated, others, like that involving credible allegations of Russian money laundering, remain barely touched. If the Russians do have leverage over the President of the United States, the Majority has simply decided it would rather not know. On the final aspect of our work — setting out the prescriptions for protecting the country going forward — we will endeavor to continue our work, with or without the active participation of the Majority.\n\n-\n\n>“In the coming weeks and months, new information will continue to be exposed through enterprising journalism, indictments by the Special Counsel, or continued investigative work by Committee Democrats and our counterparts in the Senate. And each time this new information becomes public, Republicans will be held accountable for abandoning a critical investigation of such vital national importance.”'
'There you have it, folks: Republicans are okay with foreign interference in a democratic election of it helps them win.\n\nFor some of us there was never any doubt, but now we\'ve got the proof. \n\nThis is an absolute gut punch, even for folks like me who always expected the worst, like the difference between knowing one has cancer and hearing the doctor say the word. That last spark of hope, snuffed. This feels like election day all over again, and the bitter realization that so many of my fellow Americans would put party over the wellbeing of their nation.\n\nI hope their thirty pieces of silver were worth it, traitorous bastards. \n  \nI don\'t always have a visceral emotional reaction to the news, but this hits home.  Not since election day when 62,000,000 of my fellow Americans said "Yeah, thanks for bringing the unemployment rate down to 4.6%, and doubling the stock market, and halving the number of uninsured, and passing the biggest banking reforms since the New Deal, and improving America\'s respectability around the world, but we think it\'s time to elect a racist, sexist, xenophobic, misogynistic liar, with no job experience, no relevant education, and a long history of ripping people off.  Yeah, raising the minimum wage sounds okay, but cutting taxes for millionaires and billionaires sounds better.  And sure, expanding health care coverage sounds like a good idea, but how about we gut it instead?  Yep, reducing the debt and deficit would be fine, but blowing it up would be even better.  Clean water tastes good, but I prefer coal ash.  Sure the 1st amendment protects freedom of the press, but here\'s an even better thought, let\'s gimp libel laws and sue people like you\'ve never sued before!"  \n  \nSeeing 62,000,000 Americans vote for a racist, sexist, xenophobic asshole was a kick in the gut.  Seeing the House Intelligence Committee end their investigation is a kick in the gut too.  \n  \nDon\'t get me wrong, I never doubted that Republicans cared more about power, more about their party, than they did about the American people.  When it comes to so many subjects, regulations, gun laws, environmental protections, education, taxes, the budget, judicial appointments, wages, and a thousand others I\'m not going to take the time to list, it was clear that Republicans were willing to throw their country and their constituents under the bus.  "If kids want clean water let them lift themselves up by their bootstraps I say!"  That\'s not new news to anyone who\'s been paying attention since the party began its decline somewhere around the Nixon era, it\'s been obvious how little they care about us for some time now.  \n  \nBut this?  Turning a blind eye to clear interference in a democratic election, a speck at the very heart of what this nation was built upon?  It\'s a kick in the gut.  Knowing that Republicans would sell out the soul of this country for 1.5 trillion pieces of silver is offensive beyond measure, beyond words, it makes me sick.  Not metaphorically sick, but physically nauseous.  \n  \nMany of us have known that there was a cancer in our country, we\'ve watched it grow and spread, rot bone and poison blood alike, we *knew* our nation was ill, we *knew* the diagnosis.... but this is like hearing it from the doctor himself.  \n\n"I\'m sorry to say it\'s quite advanced, maybe if we\'d caught it sooner..."  \n  \nThere was never any doubt, but there was *the hope of the doubt.*  Maybe, just *maybe* it\'s not as bad as it looks like, *maybe* the pain is unrelated, *maybe* it\'s just swelling, *maybe* it\'ll go away on its own, *maybe* I\'m going to be okay.  The hope of the doubt, that perhaps all the signs we\'ve been ignoring and explaining for so long were wrong all along.  \n  \nThen the doctor calls and the breakfast that I couldn\'t stand to eat erupts out of me and onto the floor.  \nI always knew, but *now I know,* and knowing is somehow worse.  \n  \nJudas sold out his beloved friend for 30 pieces of silver, and now we know how much it would have cost to sell out all of Rome.  \n  \n/rant\n\nThere\'s some irony in this.  I was discussing gun reform today, and one of the talking points that inevitably comes up is "We need the 2nd amendment to defend ourselves against tyranny!" and when I look at my government today *I see tyranny.*  But what would happen if you and I and all the rest rose up *against* that tyranny?  Not a revolution, but a civil war.

"Reminder that Mueller's job is to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election, an investigation that has resulted in numerous indictments and guilty pleas.

There is no reason the HIC's conclusion, even if it was accurate, should lead to terminating the special counsel. They concede Russia engaged in active measures against the United States during the 2016 election, and that is what Mueller is investigating.\n\nHe should be allowed to continue that investigation until it is complete, and follow whatever leads he finds, including leads the HIC actively chose to ignore.\n\nAnd to Trump supporters here to troll us: Imagine a parallel universe where Hillary won the election and Democrats had majorities in the house and senate. Chelsea Clinton is brokering peace in the middle east, Podesta is Secretary of Education, whatever. It's your worst nightmare. The HIC, led by Adam Schiff, begrudgingly took up a half-hearted investigation into her emails, uranium one, etc. During this investigation Democrats refused to subpoena key witnesses, released a memo containing cherry-picked bits of classified information that fit their narrative, then ended the investigation and released a partisan statement with no input from Republicans on the committee that claimed Hillary had been exonerated.

Viewed from **that** lens even the "craziest" things he said actually make a great deal of sense from that viewpoint.\n\nWhy is the "Australian deal terrible on all sides"? Because it conflicts with almost every point. It was a deal made in the 20 years pre-trump, what america got out of it was largely "free trade" which he DOESN\'T like, and in exchange he has to review immigrants when he doesn\'t even want to talk about looking at them.

We won\'t take immigrants from boat OR plane! or Car! or Foot!"  \n\nYou basically don\'t even have to parse the Mexico talks he\'s even more direct. He doesn\'t give a shit about where the money from the wall comes from because in ***his mind*** the wall will save tens of billions (or more) from leaving the country due to reduction in drug trade.

'Holy FUCK the call with the Aussie PM is fucking crazyballs. \n\n>Trump: I was with a man who does this for a living. He was telling me, before the migration, that if you were a Christian from Syria, you had no chance of coming to the United States. Zero. They were the ones being persecuted. When I say persecuted, I mean their heads were being chopped off. If you were a Muslim we have nothing against Muslims, but if you were a Muslim you were not persecuted at least to the extent – but if you were a Muslim from Syria that was the number one place to get into the United States from. That was the easiest thing. But if you were a Christian from Syria you have no chance of getting into the United States. I just thought it was an incredible statistic. Totally true – and you have seen the same thing. It is incredible.\n\nSource: He talked to a guy who does "this" for a living.

You can decide to take them or to not take them after vetting. You can decide to take 1,000 or 100. It is entirely up to you. The obligation is to only go through the process. So that is the first thing. Secondly, the people — none of these people are from the conflict zone. They are basically economic refugees from Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. That is the vast bulk of them. They have been under our supervision for over three years now and we know exactly everything about them.\n....\n\n> This is a big deal. It is really, really important to us that we maintain it. It does not oblige you to take one person that you do not want. As I have said, your homeland officials have visited and they have already interviewed these people. You can decide. It is at your discretion. So you have the wording in the Executive Order that enables the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State to admit people on a case by case basis in order to conform with an existing agreement.\n\n>Trump: why is this so important? I do not understand. This is going to kill me. **I am the world’s greatest person that does not want to let people into the country**. And now I am agreeing to take 2,000 people and I agree I can vet them, but that puts me in a bad position. It makes me look so bad and I have only been here a week.\n\n>TURNBULL:\nWith great respect, that is not right – It is not 2,000.\n\n>TRUMP"\nWell, it is close. **I have also heard like 5,000 as well**.\n\n>TURNBULL\nThe given number in the agreement is 1,250 and it is entirely a matter of your vetting. I think that what you could say is that the Australian government is consistent with the principles set out in the Executive Order.\n\n\nand a bit later..\n\n>Trump: Does anybody know who these people are? Who are they? Where do they come from? Are they going to become the Boston bomber in five years? Or two years? Who are these people?\n\n>TURNBULL: Let me explain. We know exactly who they are. They have been on Nauru or Manus for over three years and the only reason we cannot let them into Australia is because of our commitment to not allow people to come by boat. Otherwise we would have let them in. If they had arrived by airplane and with a tourist visa then they would be here.\n\n>TRUMP: Malcom [sic], but they are arrived on a boat?\n\n>TURNBULL: Correct, we have stopped the boats.\n\n>TRUMP: Give them to the United States. We are like a dumping ground for the rest of the world. I have been here for a period of time, I just want this to stop. I look so foolish doing this. It [sic] know it is good for you but it is bad for me. It is horrible for me. This is what I am trying to stop. I do not want to have more San Bernardino’s or World Trade Centers. I could name 30 others, but I do not have enough time.\n\n\nI can\'t even remember that last time I could even. WHAT THE FUCK?!?!!?!??!\n\n\n>TURNBULL: These guys are not in that league. They are economic refugees.\n\n>TRUMP:\nOkay, good. Can Australia give me a guarantee that if we have any problems – you know that is what they said about the Boston bombers.

"Peña-Nieto and Turnbull show very different conversational styles.\n\nPeña-Nieto uses deferential language, tries to look for common ground and intersecting interests, while also affirming his position and the dignity of Mexico. \n\nTurnbull is a little more frank, and tries to level with Trump. And maybe this is because Turnbull assumes Trump will regard him as a peer, whereas Peña-Nieto has no such illusions about where he stands in Trump's mental image of the world. \n\nThe result is that Peña-Nieto gets warmer treatment, whereas Turnbull basically gets shut down.\n\nThe lesson here is that Trump needs to be patronized and spoken to like a surly adolescent instead of being regarded and spoken to like an adult, which clearly he is not.

'If supporting or recieving support from the NRA becomes a Republican albatross I will be a very happy boy indeed'
'Glen Simpson, founder of Fusion GPS, from his congressional interview in August 2017\n\n>It appears the Russians, you know, infiltrated the NRA, and there is more than one explanation for why. But I would say broadly speaking, it appears that the Russian operation was designed to infiltrate conservative organizations. And they targeted various conservative organizations, religious and otherwise, and they seem to have made a very concerted effort to get in with the NRA.\n\n>And so there is a Russian banker-slash-Duma member-slash-Mafia leader named Alexander Torshin who is a life member of the NRA. And we spent a lot of time investigating Mr. Torshin. And he is well known to Spanish law enforcement for money laundering activity and you have probably seen the press articles. And I think the Spanish files on him should be available to you. And he, as you know, was supposed to have a meeting with President Trump after the inauguration. And somebody noticed that there had been some stories about him that weren’t pretty good.'
">“If the NRA is actually a front for Russian interests and interfered with our elections, actively or passively, then they have undermined the very democratic freedoms they purport to represent. We can only wonder how many true patriots will decide that this is the last straw and give up their NRA memberships.”\n\ntrue patriots aren't NRA members. "
"There's a pretty good argument to be made at this point that a lot of the last 10 to 15 years of Republican politics -- tea party, alt-right, etc. was essentially instigated by and paid for by Russians looking to undermine the US."
"Unless this has already been proven, the idea is that Russia used the US supreme court ruling on Citizens United in order to legally send dark money to the NRA.  The NRA then used this new wealth to fund Republican campaigns, because Republicans are loyal to the NRA's ideals and are devout believers in the 2nd Amendment.  \n\nThis is why we see the NRA giving $30 million to Trump and smaller sums to other Republicans.  They have serious money to lobby with thanks to Russia, and in exchange, they've become stooges to Russia and are more like a terrorist organization now due to their complicity in Russia's meddling.  They know they're toast if the FBI looks at them because they've been helping a foreign power take over our politics."

'>"How is this to be avoided, among ordinary men, even highly educated ordinary men? Frankly, I do not know. I do not see, even now. Many, many times since it all happened I have pondered that pair of great maxims, Principiis obsta and Finem respice—‘Resist the beginnings’ and ‘Consider the end.’ But one must foresee the end in order to resist, or even see, the beginnings. One must foresee the end clearly and certainly and how is this to be done, by ordinary men or even by extraordinary men? Things might have. And everyone counts on that might.\n\n>"Your ‘little men,’ your Nazi friends, were not against National Socialism in principle. Men like me, who were, are the greater offenders, not because we knew better (that would be too much to say) but because we sensed better. Pastor Niemöller spoke for the thousands and thousands of men like me when he spoke (too modestly of himself) and said that, when the Nazis attacked the Communists, he was a little uneasy, but, after all, he was not a Communist, and so he did nothing; and then they attacked the Socialists, and he was a little uneasier, but, still, he was not a Socialist, and he did nothing; and then the schools, the press, the Jews, and so on, and he was always uneasier, but still he did nothing. And then they attacked the Church, and he was a Churchman, and he did something—but then it was too late."\n\n>"Yes," I said.\n\n>"You see," my colleague went on, "one doesn’t see exactly where or how to move. Believe me, this is true. Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don’t want to act, or even talk, alone; you don’t want to ‘go out of your way to make trouble.’ Why not?—Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.\n\n>"Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, ‘everyone’ is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You know, in France or Italy there would be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences; in Germany, outside the great cities, perhaps, there is not even this. In the university community, in your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, ‘It’s not so bad’ or ‘You’re seeing things’ or ‘You’re an alarmist.’\n\n>"And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can’t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don’t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.\n\n>"But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Informal groups become smaller; attendance drops off in little organizations, and the organizations themselves wither. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to—to what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then you are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.\n\n>"But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That’s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the ‘German Firm’ stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.\n\n>"And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.\n\n>"You have gone almost all the way yourself. Life is a continuing process, a flow, not a succession of acts and events at all. It has flowed to a new level, carrying you with it, without any effort on your part. On this new level you live, you have been living more comfortably every day, with new morals, new principles. You have accepted things you would not have accepted five years ago, a year ago, things that your father, even in Germany, could not have imagined.\n\n>"Suddenly it all comes down, all at once. You see what you are, what you have done, or, more accurately, what you haven’t done (for that was all that was required of most of us: that we do nothing). You remember those early meetings of your department in the university when, if one had stood, others would have stood, perhaps, but no one stood.

If trump has been reading TS emails on his phone out in the open while playing golf, then that should be handled properly. If he's just tweeting and looking at Russian porn, yes his location and privacy may be compromised, but that's more of a Secret Service matter than something for the FBI."

"Is it really true that so many people are technologically illiterate to the point that they don't understand the difference between private emails and private email servers?\n\nPrivate emails:  Go through a companies email servers.  They are usually redundant for DR purposes, and they are backed up in accordance with data retention policies mandated by the government. Once you send a email on a private email account the data is under the control of that other company (AOL, gmail, yahoo etc).\n\n\nPrivate email servers:  May or may not be backed up in accordance with government laws.  Often isn't redundant for the purposes of DR and the people who control the server control the data.  \n\n\nIf Hillary isn't smart enough to understand that I'm glad she didn't get elected, though I'm sure she is 100% smart enough and says things like this because so many of the people who voted for her are not smart enough to know it."
'The definitive summary of Clinton\'s emails:\n\n* Clinton used personal email addresses connected to a privately-owned server, rather than a government email, during her four years as President Barack Obama\'s first-term secretary of state.\n\n* Some previous secretaries of state -- including Colin Powell -- have also used private email accounts, but Clinton\'s approach was particularly controversial because it\'s out of step with typical government practice *now* - after the fact. John Kerry used private email up until 2015. \n\n* The server that hosted the email account was set up years before Clinton became Secretary of State for her husband, President Bill Clinton, to host his secure email. The server was located at their home which was guarded by Secret Service at all times. It turns out this was much more secure than the actual State Department email server, which did get hacked, while the Clinton\'s did not.\n\n* **Clinton did not break any laws**. There are laws intended to keep government records transparent -- but one that requires officials to transfer emails sent to private addresses onto government servers wasn\'t enacted until 2014, after Clinton departed the State Department.\n\n* Clinton sent and received 60,000 emails during her four years as SoS. 30,000 were work related, and 30,000 were personal. Clinton handed over all 30,000 work related emails, and deleted the 30,000 personal emails off her server before handing over access to the entire server for investigation. \n\n* **Clinton did not send or receive any classified emails.** Of the 30,000 work related emails, some were *retroactively classified* years later, so they were not in violation at the time they were sent or received. And three (3) total emails were classified but incorrectly marked as non-classified.\n\n* **In 2016, the average nightly news cast spent just 32 minutes on policy and 100 minutes on emails.** This told voters that Clinton\'s emails were three times more important than every other policy issue combined, even though she had been completely cleared of any wrongdoing. This is why you think it is an issue when it isn\'t. Because you heard the word "email" more than any other word last year. Because "emails" got ratings. '
'Can she please just go away? Then we can get Trump to go away and we can all be friends again.'
'Sort of rich, coming from her. I get the hypocrisy, but Hillary should be rotting in a jail cell. She\'s just as protected. Any "normal" folk that did what she had done would be in prison.'

This is a harsh lesson the GOP is about to learn and really its for the best. Their philosophy for the future of this country is, well, shit lol'

'Canadians have long supported free and fair trade supported by reasonable labour and environmental standards. When Trump talks \'fair\' trade, he doesn\'t mean fair for all, or fair for workers, or even fair for Americans, he means, "makes me look good in front of Kim Jong Un and my base". \n\nCanada already has the most open market in the G20, with average trade-weighted tariffs a mere 0.8% (half those of the EU and the USA). The ONE exception we carved out for  ourselves under NAFTA was the preservation of our agricultural supply management system. This was to prevent the US from dumping subsidized agriculture products into Canada and destroying our local food security. Wisconsin alone, for instance, has more cows than the entire population of Canada and 75% of the cost of each gallon of milk in the US is subsidized by federal grants. The US oversupply of milk is so bad, farmers dump 100 million gallons a year to support prices. The US is China in this situation, massively subsidizing its industries (corn, anyone?) to flood global markets and eliminate competition. No, we don\'t want that here. It\'s dumping and illegal under WTO rules. In fact, ask any Wisconsin farmer if they want to sell their milk in Canada and they\'re likely to tell you that what they really want is a supply management system like Canada\'s to ensure fair, stable prices for their products. \n\nNow, we\'re watching in dismay as a characterless, corrupt megalomaniac stomps all over a balanced, mutually beneficial trade relationship with childish tantrums. The fucking handshakes, porn star mistresses, disgusting tweets, corrupt deals with oligarchs... Who\'s sticking up for Canada while this monster trashes a 30-year trade alliance?

"Okay, I'm not going to say that the USA should get rid of Trump, because dozens of people say that here every day, many of them more eloquently than I could. But something I've noticed that doesn't get enough play (not only here, but in all other media) is that we really have to start figuring out how **Russia can get rid of Putin**. Unrealistic, sure, but any Russian who dreams of his or her country being respected by the non-criminal world *has* to start agitating for him to go. Ideally, there would be some tipping point that instigates another Velvet Revolution, but honestly, at this stage, even a military junta with aims of democratic transition would be an improvement.\n\nAs for us in the West, we have to stop treating Putin with the respect the pasty little shrimp thinks he deserves. But before any more radical steps, I think the first that all Western nations *must* undertake is to ***confiscate all oligarch assets abroad, especially Putin's***. Freezing them has been insufficient, and since the guy has no qualms about waging his Weasel War of propaganda and misinformation on any other country, we should have no qualms about stripping as much of value from him and his lackeys as possible. As a Canadian, I'm fairly happy with Trudeau's early steps against Trump and Putin, and I'll certainly be pushing for him to step up Canada's countermeasures.\n\nAs for where all that money should go, it'd be fitting and just to add it directly to NATO's operating fund. Of course, Putin would call that a provocation, but we're long past the point at which we should be telling him to go fuck himself."

Many of the attendees are very wealthy business people, and I’m sure they are very much enjoying the way the market has been performing since he took office.\n\nBut hivemind.'

The BBC very rarely goes out on a limb like this, so it will be very well sourced."
"Graft, as understood in American English, is a form of political corruption, being the unscrupulous use of a politician's authority for personal gain. The term has its origins in the medical procedure whereby tissue is removed from one location and attached to another for which it was not originally intended. Similarly, political graft occurs when funds intended for public projects are intentionally misdirected in order to maximize the benefits to private interests."
'Best thing for me: this was a BBC breaking news alert. Usually it will read as a headline and something like “more details as they come in”. \n\nBut this? This was a whole fucking essay.

In a February phone conversation with TPM, a nervous-sounding Freidman confirmed that he’d been managing medallions for Cohen for more than 16 years, including some in Chicago. While emphasizing that he didn’t want to comment on such a “hot issue,” he heaped praise on his longtime friend, saying the two “talk daily sometimes.”\n\n> “I keep up a relationship with him,” Freidman said before rushing off the phone. “I help him out as much as I can. I also have a business relationship but we’re friends, you know. We have dinner with his wife.”\n\nNot only is he dealing with him in New York but also Chicago where Cohen also has deals with the **Ukranian cab driver Simon Garber.**\n\n> [Cohen once ran 260 yellow cabs with his Ukrainian-born partner, the "taxi king" Simon V. Garber, until their partnership ended acrimoniously in 2012. Glenn Simpson, the private investigator who was independently hired to examine Trump\'s Russia connections during the real estate mogul\'s presidential run, testified before the House Intelligence Committee that Cohen "had a lot of connections to the former Soviet Union, and that he seemed to have associations with **organized crime figures in New York and Florida – Russian organized crime figures," including Garber.**](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/michael-cohens-ties-to-russia-crime-and-trump-w518941)\n\nWhich leads to [quite an interesting story](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8liyq7/cohen_partner_pleads_guilty_in_deal_requiring/dzfvxk0/)\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nHow else is Michael Cohen involved in Ukraine?\n\n> [The oligarch has been investigated for money laundering and the FBI has tied three of his employees to the Russian mob.

But unlike the DNC, Time doesn't want to insult people by baiting and switching the more popular choice. Therefore they play with the numbers a little so Trump slides down the list."

'I think "**Russia has the most beautiful hookers in the world**" is a code phrase used by the Russians and their assets to either tell people to take action, or for one asset to innocuously ask someone if they\'re also an asset. Putin said it during a speech he knew would be heard by Trump in January 2017. Trump then later repeated it to Comey a couple weeks later.\n\nCall me paranoid, but I get the impression that Trump has been a Russian asset since at least the \'90s. That\'s around the time that US banks would no longer lend to him and he had to go abroad to with his hat out. I\'m thinking he got into debt with the wrong people, and just when he was panicking that they were coming for him - or his loved ones - he was approached by Russia\'s Foreign Intelligence Service  offering to make it all go away.\n\nKeep in mind Trump has had access to the White House, US Presidents, and America\'s elite for decades. Between that, his self-serving nature, and his money problems - he would be the ideal mark.\n\nI\'m not talking James Bond activity, just "get this politician doing cocaine/a hooker in front of this hidden camera". This would also explain why Trump & Co have never really faced prosecution - it\'s possible he and his handlers have enough blackmail material to shut down any investigations that threaten the asset - until Mueller.\n\nIt\'s totally possible I\'m just paranoid, but if true - America is in a lot more trouble than people now realize...'

'Well sure. Most kids talk to their ~~puppets~~ toys when they play with them.'
'1. Forget "collusion", look at just Russian interference in the 2016 election. There is overwhelming evidence that a nuclear power which has *never* had the best interests of the US at heart, intentionally interfered in the presidential election and managed to tip the results to their preferred candidate.\n\n2. Said candidate, now president, talks regularly on the phone to leader of said power, which again, never has the US\' best interests at heart.\n\n3. Said president also starts treating former allies like crap, while treating this foreign power like its best buddy.\n\nWhy y\'all aren\'t surrounding the White House with millions of people brandishing torches and pitchforks is, seriously, completely beyond me.'
"Okay well that's definitely a good thing and I'd start getting nervous the days when they do *not* keep in touch with, at least, some regularity. \n\nOf course Russia isn't what it used to be, is a relatively poor 2nd world country BUT it still occupies a massive swatch of the earth, holds a lot of geopolitical power and influence and still has old weapons. \n\nPutin may not be our most important ally or even the 10th most important ally. But he might be one of the USA's top 'Frienemies' and all the more reason to keep up good regular conversations going. "
"Maybe it's true, maybe it isn't.  No reason to trust Putin or Trump though.  \n\nThe fact is both are trying to lie their way through the world, so we need to start worrying what is best for US."

And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, makes moneys, believe me...You don't want the truth. Because deep down, in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me to build that wall. You need me to build that wall.\nI use words like Tremendous, Huge, Bigly...I use these words as the backbone to a life spent defending something. You use 'em as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very wealth I provide, then questions the manner in which I provide it! I'd rather you just said thank you and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you declare loyalty to me and follow my lead. Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you're entitled to!\n\n>Mueller: Did you collude?\n\n>Trump: (quietly) I did the job this country needs me to do.\n\n>Mueller: Did you collude?\n\n>Trump: You're goddamn right I did!!"
'Trump, just want to say Obama would be too chicken to talk to Mueller. You should definitely do it, prove your better than Obama.'
"Can you hear it?  The Republicans aren't gonna do a thing.. but their reason?.. it's beyond the scope of the Russia COLLUSION! YEAY I LOVE REPUBLICANS!/s"
"When Mueller puts out his report on the issue of obstruction of justice, my prediction is that he is going to have upwards of a thousand different verified pieces of evidence, on *hundreds* of different obstructing actions.\n\nTrump not only *did* obstruct justice, he can't *stop* obstructing justice, because **he doesn't understand what justice is.** And he does not care."
"He's still obstructing justice. Can anyone remember a President who constantly bullies his AG like this? I have no love for Sessions but this is getting ridiculous."
'"Imagine what a normal president would say in this situation. He’d say, “It doesn’t matter whether the special counsel’s investigation is overseen by the attorney general or the deputy attorney general. Once the investigation is completed and all the facts are laid out, it will be clear that I’m innocent.”"\n\nMy favorite bit from the article'
'Dear overseas Friends, we support you, despite everything and anything. Our bond is stronger than this. Sincerely yours, Europe.  '
'The "debate" was over the minute Trump himself admitted to Lester Holt—on national TV—that he obstructed justice. Had Obama done that, the Republican party would have called for *immediate* impeachment and been *right* to do so—period. I\'d have supported the impeachment of a man I respected if he\'d have committed just *one* of the various criminal acts this current president has committed, especially if he\'d so brazenly admitted it to a reporter.\n\nThe media likes the idea that there\'s a debate about this stuff. It keeps the story going and gives them more content. There is no debate between any two people who respect the rule of law in this country—the current president has obstructed justice and committed federal crimes in the process. What many news outlets don\'t understand (or care about) is that, by creating the *illusion* of a debate, they are participating in the muddying of waters on the president\'s behalf. They are his pawns, either wittingly or unwittingly, and they sell their souls (and ours) for money.'
'I feel like after Trumps presidency America needs to have a long hard look at their laws to stop a future president from abusing the law and OPENLY obstructing justice to get his own way. \nI do not understand how he is able to continually obstruct justice and undermine the Mueller investigation with 0 consequences. \nThat is not justice. '
'Doesn’t he always obstruct justice? He thinks he’s above the law. \n\nNever mind, indictment is coming, Donny boy :p '
"Glad that's cleared up.. will be nice to have a few weeks without trump in the news."
"There's probably at least ten separate counts of obstruction and attempt to obstruct because its not just the firing of COmey, its all the other interference. We know he asked Comey before firing him. He also asked Sessions, Coats, NSA Director, etc. And this is just the shit we know, he I'm sure fucking was non stop trying to obstruct this shit and openly discussing how to do so"
'So, are you saying trump thought being president would allow him and his friends and family to commit massive amounts of financial crimes and get away with it like the leaders of extremely corrupt countries do?\n\nWe dont want our country to be ran like Brazil, D.P. Congo, Russia, or any of the other terrible places to live'
'So, I never liked Grassley or Grahm but they seemed like men of dignity. **Boy was I wrong.** '
"Let's prosecute former members of allied intelligence services. Surely this will safeguard democracy and western civilization. "
"Now I'm sure Trump/GOP/Russians has kompromat on Graham.  The relatively short amount of time between throwing shade at the president and kissing his ass and carrying water for him is staggering.\n\nWe are living in an absolutely extraordinary time in history that is going to be thoroughly studied for at least the next 100 years.  The sitting senators better wake the fuck up and realize who is going to come out as the heroes of our republic and who is going to be castigated as ancillary villians in this blotch on American history."
"It's official. Russia won Cold War 2.\n\nOur only hope for winning Round 3 is voting them out in November, chasing chickens around and running up a snow covered mountain in Siberia."
'This is it. The republicans have fully committed to protecting trump. This will be used to justify a Saturday night massacre type push to get rid of mueller. Seems like a great weekend to try it too, with the nfl playoffs starting and the national championship game of college football over the next 3 days. Even after the revelations that the investigation was prompted by other intelligence, they will continue to push the lie that the dossier was made up then used to start the fbi investigation, and use this lie to try to stop the investigation.'
'Remember this.  Remember this forever.\n\n\nThe Republican party is corrupt to its core and unfit to govern.  They will always put party ahead of country. '

'"Look, you people in the media can\'t expect that we vet the people working in this administration and thoroughly look at each and every resume.

They believe you that a wall will stop drugs, but then also agree with you that the DEA is useless?\n\nThe President is a cult leader.  The GOP is a cult.  It should be treated as such.'

"American teacher here. \n\nWho's buying these guns?  I'm not eating that expense. Who's paying for the safety training, the ammunition, the gun safes?  I'm not eating those costs either. \n\nWhere is this money coming from? Is my department budget line going to suddenly triple next year to pay for this or is this an unfunded mandate that means even less technology or even copy paper?\n\nWho thinks this is a good idea and have they ever spent any time teaching in a classroom?"
"> I never said “give teachers guns” like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @NBC. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving “concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to\n\nJesus Christ.  I thought there'd at least be a couple/few tweets in between where he got himself riled up and blurted out the thing, or references to things he's said previously.  But no.  It was all contained in the same tweet.  Back-to-back sentences.\n\nIs this not peak absurdity?  Are we not there yet?"
'This is what Trump said:\n\n> "If you had a teacher who was adept at firearms, they could very well end the attack very quickly, and the good thing about a suggestion like that -- and we\'re going to be looking at it very strongly...but the good thing is you\'ll have a lot of people with that."\n'
'The best way to make kids safe when bullets are flying is to introduce more bullets!'
"OMG I just watched 10 minutes of Trump's meeting. Holy shit, this man has totally lost it. He started talking about ice cream, giving teachers who are concealed carry raises, then went into a bizarre fan fiction about how if John Kelly was a history teacher, he'd be a badass in an active shooter scenario. And then went on to describe wanting to see Kelly  - who would be teaching a class on the history of great military battles (in this imaginary scenario), confront a school shooter and show him AND the dopey security guard how a real tough cookie would handle a weapon. \n\nIf you can't understand what I just wrote, that's ok. I don't either. I tried my best to make it as coherent and intelligible as possible as it dribbled out of Donald's mouth.\n"
"The thing about the good guy bad guy with a gun theory is that good guys don't kill without absolute certainty it will save theirs or others lives. When there are multiple good guys with guns then there is a very real chance that you could come across a good guy killing a bad guy which means even witnessing a kill does not give you certainty. How many good guys will be able to kill someone with certainty before a homicidal maniac with an AR 15 opens fire with no moral dilemmas?\n\nTeachers with guns in these situations will just make the job 100 times harder for police and likely end with friendly fire deaths. "
'This is such a standard trope for him. I didn’t do controversial thing but if I had it would be great. A slight variation, I didn’t say shithole countries, but the words I did use were very tough!'
'So what... give two teachers training and guns?  When an active shooter is in a school said teacher is supposed to move on a dude with an AR-15 like a swat specialist?  Drop what they’re doing and go running around a school with a hand gun, hope they don’t get shot, and more importantly hope they don’t shoot an innocent student?  Yeaaaah... sounds like a great plan. '
"Forgetting about whether or not arming teachers would work to prevent school shootings, do people really want to live in a world where kids are being taught in an environment like that? It's absolutely insane and dystopian. Why not just put up guard towers and barbed wire fences, and every student gets scanned with a metal detector on their way in? What kind of people will they become if we treat them like criminals under armed guard every day of their lives? Truly, truly, disgusting."
'The full exchange wasn’t in the article. This is unbelievable.\n\nRead the full exchange below:\n\nReporter: Did Russia\'s attempts to meddle in US elections come up in the conversations?\n\nTrump: "He said he didn\'t meddle, he said he didn\'t meddle. I asked him again. You can only ask so many times."\n\nReporter: Today?\n\nTrump: "I just asked him again. He said he absolutely did not meddle in our election, he did not do what they are saying he did."\n\nReporter: Do you believe him?\n\nTrump: "Well, look, I can\'t stand there and argue with him, I would rather have him get out of Syria, I would rather get to work with him on the Ukraine rather than arguing about whether or not... that whole thing was set up by the Democrats. Look at Podesta, look at all the things that they have done with the phony dossier. Those are the big events. But Putin said he did not do what they said he did. But we have a good feeling toward getting things done. If we had a relationship with Russia, that would be a good thing. In fact it would be a great thing, not a bad thing, because he could really help us on North Korea. We have a big problem with North Korea and China is helping us. And because of the lack of the relationship that we have with Russia, because of this artificial thing that\'s happening with this Democratic-inspired thing. We could really be helped a lot with Russia having to do with North Korea. You know you are talking about millions and millions of lives. This isn\'t baby stuff, this is the real deal. And if Russia helped us in addition to China, that problem would go away a lot faster."\n\nReporter: On election meddling, did you ask him the question?\n\nTrump: "Every time he sees me he says I didn\'t do that and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it. But he says I didn\'t do that. I think he is very insulted by it, which is not a good thing for our country. Because again, if we had a relationship with Russia, North Korea which is our single biggest problem right now, it would help a lot. I think they are doing very well with respect to China, they have cut off financing, they have cut off lots of oil and lots of other things, lots of trade and it\'s having a big impact. But Russia on the other hand may be making up the difference. And if they are, that\'s not a good thing. So having a relationship with Russia would be a great thing especially as it relates to North Korea."\n\n"Hillary had her stupid reset button that she spelled the word wrong, but she does not have what it takes to have that kind of relationship where you could call or you could do something. But this is really an artificial barrier that\'s put in front of us for solving problems with Russia. He says that very strongly, he really seems to be insulted by it and he says he didn\'t do it. He is very, very strong in the fact that he didn\'t do it. You have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he has nothing to do with that. Now, you are not going to get into an argument, you are going to start talking about Syria and the Ukraine."'
"Well Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump are the two most honest people I know so I guess that's that.\n\nLooking forward to see you in leg irons, Donnie."
"Obviously he doesn't. He is just amplifying Putin's denial in an effort to tell his base it didn't happen. \n\nBut let's look at the optics of this:\n\nThe President of the United States is lying and saying he disagrees with the previous POTUS, the CIA, the NSA, the FBI, the Pentagon, his own Secretary of Defense, his own Secretary of State, his own Department of Justice, and even Congress which is controlled by his own party.\n\nPutin won. "
'Trump: hey buddy, did you meddle in the election?\n\nPutin: lol, no!\n\nTrump: lol, kk! Luv u!\n\n*Seen at 1201 am*'
"So the President of the United States believes the leader of a nation that is antagonistic to the interests of the US and its citizens, rather than his own intelligence agencies. Got it. If this isn't sufficient reason for the Republicans to impeach Trump nothing would be."
'All the other world leaders treat him like the simpleton he is, they coddle, and entertain, they ignore, and in the end they use him.'

'I have to agree with President Trump on this\n\nformer KGB agents are known for their honesty'
'Over our OWN USA intelligence agencies! This man, has no honor, traitor by every definition of the word.'
"Trump is the perfect mark.  A moron who doesn't understand he is a moron, and easily manipulated.  Just make Trump think he is the smartest guy in the room, and that your idea was HIS idea, and he will transform into a happy chimp ready to do your bidding.  "

'Who would win? All of the intelligence committee in the United States and members of the administration who clearly had knowledge of this meddling? Or one ruski boi?'
'Trusting an adversarial world leader over your own intelligence agencies... Interesting tactic Mr. President! #maga'

'> **Swalwell Introduces Bill to Stop Trump From Using the Presidency to Enrich Himself and His Family**\n\n> July 23, 2018 Press Release\n\n> WASHINGTON, DC – Rep. Eric Swalwell (CA-15) introduced Prevent Corrupting Foreign Influence Act on Monday to significantly improve upon the existing ban on America’s highest elected officials receiving financial benefits from foreign powers.\n\n> The new bill would make it a criminal offense for the President, the Vice President, their families, or companies in which they have at least half-ownership to accept or receive anything of value from a foreign power or from any company that is more than 50 percent controlled by a foreign power.\n\n> “Unlike other Presidents, Donald Trump has failed to distance himself from his private business interests while serving our nation, and so he and his family are getting richer from Trump companies that receive money and benefits from foreign powers,” Swalwell said. “Americans deserve to know that their President is working for them and only them, not having his own wallet fattened by foreign interests.”\n\n> Presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush used blind trusts to isolate their business interests while in office. President Barack Obama didn’t only because he didn’t hold any interests or assets that could present a conflict of interests.\n\n> The Constitution already prohibits government employees – including elected officials, but not their relatives – from receiving “emoluments” or gifts from foreign states except as allowed by Congress. Current statutes implement this ban, provide reporting for gifts which are allowed, and provide for civil penalties for violations.\n\n> The Prevent Corrupting Foreign Influence Act would improve upon current law. First, it would expand the prohibition’s scope from merely gifts to include “anything of value.” Second, it would expand the prohibition’s application – for sources, to include companies controlled by foreign countries, and for recipients, to include the President’s and Vice President’s immediate family members and companies they control. Third, it would make violations subject to criminal penalties.\n\n> Swalwell was inspired to draft the bill after a Chinese government-controlled company – the Metallurgical Corporation of China – loaned $500 million to benefit a massive development project in Indonesia, called Lido City, in which the Trump organization is involved.  At the same time, President Trump has eased sanctions on Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE.\n\n> Swalwell also noted the Trump family companies’ long history of Russian investments and banking connections – a cause for concern as the President charts an inexplicably close relationship with the Russian dictator Vladimir Putin despite that nation’s interference in America’s elections. Though the new bill would not criminalize past financial arrangements, it would ensure no such relationships continue.\n\n> Events like these demonstrate a danger that foreign states can use a web of connections between President Trump, his family members, and their family business to exert improper influence over official decisions. \n\n> “It’s long past time that Congress takes a meaningful stand against any effort to buy and sell our White House,” Swalwell said. “America’s Presidents and Vice Presidents must not enrich themselves from foreign sources – they should hold themselves to a higher standard, and if they won’t, it’s our job to do it for them.”\n\n> [Click here to read the full text of the Prevent Corrupting Foreign Influence Act.](https://swalwell.house.gov/sites/swalwell.house.gov/files/wysiwyg_uploaded/Prevent%20Corrupting%20Foreign%20Influence%20Act.pdf)'
'This is a great play, since it will never get to a vote, Democrats get to run commercials where they explain how Republicans refused to support legislation as straight forward as preventing Trump from grifting.\n\nIt will really drive home that "GOP = Corruption" message.'
'Four words.\n\nMar. A. La. Go.\n\nOr one word? Whatever.\n\nEvery weekend he makes money from the presidential entourage, secret service, etc who go with the traitor-in-chief to his golf resort. Renting rooms, food, drinks would be fees that Trump directly pockets.\n\nAnd there are very few reports of what Trump does at the resort. Who does he meet? What national secrets does he share? Very rich people are literally paying for access to the President. \n\nThis is not including the waste of flying up and down the eastern coast in Air Force One every weekend.'
'>No we are pretty much fine with him doing that. \n\n-Reoublicans. '
"Swalwell has been on both CNN and MSNBC on a regular basis opposing trump in strong language for at least a year now. Very impressive, doesn't back down.\n\nNice to see some punchback legislation from him and the crew."
"Wonderful news. Unfortunately, I'm 100% positive the GOP will shoot it down. For some reason they don't mind Trump abusing the single most important public service position in the country as a platform to gain wealth. Blows my mind."
'I seriously think that the Democratic party needs to run on the platform of **Good Governance**.\n\nIt needs to have a whole platform of bills like this that *strengthen our democracy* and make it difficult for another Trump to happen again.\n\nI think that if it were posed as a neutral set of "common sense" ideas, with the aid of preventing *any* party from hijacking the system, that it could gain huge traction with voters.\n\nStrengthen our democracy. Strengthen the separation of powers. Abolish gerrymandering. Strengthen the emoluments clause. Abolish pocket vetos and other senate shenanigans. Abolish the power of the Speaker to deny bills from going to vote. Increase the powers and protections of non-political roles in departments (e.g. career diplomats). Etc etc.\n\nI feel like this would be a powerful "Not Trump" platform without the apparent pettiness of simply being "Not Trump."'
'His supporters still think he is giving up so much by President. Hardly.'
"Pretty sure that's written directly in the Constitution the GOP talk so much about."
'This is the reason Trump is friendly with dictators and not with our allies :\n\nErdogan, duterte, kim and putin are able to single handedly enrich him and his family members. \n\nAngela Merkel, Trudeau, Theresa May have zero power to give his probably cash flow struggling companies anything. \n\nRemember - when he won the republican nomination, his first act was to parade the secret service in front of his trump steaks and advertise trump $50 steaks. \n\nIf this is what he is like in public then we should worry about his actions in private. He has never behaved like a billionaire who is acting to help humanity. He seems more like a struggling youtuber spending his time recommending his merchandise for an extra $50. \n\nI personally don’t think Putin has any sex tapes of Trump - and if he had, trump’s supporters would be proud of that.  The whole world and his wife knows he was having unprotected sex with porn stars while ‘shark week’ was on in the background and his wife was giving birth to their current child. This is certainly not a man affected by shame any more...  \n\nThe only permanent members of his administration are his family. It is much more likely that he and his family are making secret deals at the expense of our national security.  '

He's the embodiment of the Ventura culture and is a joy to listen to.\n\nThey have high prices but, it's justified by the quality of the products and their contributions to their communities, in my opinion."
'Fun fact: Patagonia has the highest standards for traceable down of any North American company. This means their birds are never live plucked, they only use feathers from birds that were bred for meat, and they maintain accountability at every stage of the process.

The monuments still exist, they've just been reduced in size to free up the most public land for general use while still protecting the things the monuments were designed to protect.\n\nTrump isn't anti-Public Land.  In fact, the Secretary of the Interior has already stated that he plans to recommend at least 3 more National Monument designations, mainly to protect Native American and African American historical landmarks."

'>  Natalia V. Veselnitskaya arrived at a meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016 hoping to interest top Trump campaign officials in the contents of a memo she believed contained information damaging to the Democratic Party and, by extension, Hillary Clinton. The material was the fruit of her research as a private lawyer, she has repeatedly said, and any suggestion that she was acting at the Kremlin’s behest that day is anti-Russia “hysteria.”\n\n> But interviews and records show that in the months before the meeting, Ms. Veselnitskaya had discussed the allegations with one of Russia’s most powerful officials, the prosecutor general, Yuri Y. Chaika. And the memo she brought with her closely followed a document that Mr. Chaika’s office had given to an American congressman two months earlier, incorporating some paragraphs verbatim.\n\n> The matching messages point to a synchronized information campaign. Like some other Russian experts, Stephen Blank, a senior fellow with the nonprofit American Foreign Policy Council in Washington, said they indicate that Ms. Veselnitskaya’s actions “were coordinated from the very top.”\n\n> Ms. Veselnitskaya declined to be interviewed, saying in an email that The New York Times had published “lies and false claims.”'
'A nice juicy tidbit: \n\n> Russian President Vladimir V. Putin repeated her charges at length last week at an annual conference of Western academics.

'Okay here is what I don‘t understand and I hope you American redditors can elaborate.\n\nYou have a president, who is almost certainly proven to have obstructed justice, who accepted payments and help in his presidential campaign and is obviously corrupted.\nYou have a congress and senate controlled by lobbies such as the NRA, Lockheed and the arms industry in general to name a few.\nYou constantly keep electing politicians who mostly show unrational behaviour and try to spread conservative and backward values and at the same time, rob their normal citizens.\nSo my question is: Why? Seriously why do you keep supporting these people?\nPoliticians keep warmongering to increase arms sales. At the same time they restrict your right for proper education by refusing to increase salaries of teachers and by allowing exorbitant college tuition fees, just because uneducated people are easier to rule.\nSo my friends, the question remains: Why don‘t you stand up for change? Why do these politicians keep getting elected again?\n\nThank you for helping me out in understanding this.\n\nPs: I know there will be downvotes, but I would actually be very happy for legitimate answers, just so I can understand :)\n\nPps: I‘m not saying that you should vote Democrats or Republicans, as Republicans would be considered as far right and Democrats as right-centre political parties in western Europe.'

'My thoughts on the EO:\n\nI think the EO crystallizes what Trump is doing here.  He could’ve implemented zero tolerance on Day One but didn’t.  Why now?\n\nI think this is about the November Elections and bridging the enthusiasm gap.  Immigration has always been one of Trump’s best arguments with his base.  He’s manufactured the immigration “crisis” and used children as hostages in an attempt to force the Congress to craft a comprehensive immigration bill with border wall funding.  He wants the November elections to be all about the “crisis at the border.”\n\nThe EO practically assures that this won’t go away.  It’ll set up a court fight that will uphold Flores and “force” Trump to separate families again, thereby forcing Congress to debate a bill under duress.  \n\nThis should be very troubling to Democrats.  Immigration is a good issue for Trump, and many Americans have already adopted the framing that there is a true immigration crisis where there is none.  Democrats will be hard-pressed to convince the public otherwise.'

Most people are trying to actively build upon that and change what they feel is wrong or stand up for what they have been shown to be right.\n\nSo when powerful people - either blunderously or maliciously - manipulate a false reality, they are truly seperating half of the population even further and further away from what is physically happening as well as away from anything that smells like it might have a little empathy attached to it.\n\nI feel like this is so important and needs to be focused on more.

I would not be at all surprised to learn that they bankrolled the Russian operations as well, dirty oil mongers stick together. \n\nJust another product of big money inheritance with no idea how to build wealth on their own, so they hire lawyers and fight to keep what they have by shafting everyone who works for them and dodging every tax dollar they can. Absolute scum of the earth, and everything they do is legal thanks to citizens united.\n\nTrump and the Russia scandal have served them well, they have been able to fly under the radar and get everything (except ACA repeal) they want without exposing themselves. While we have all been distracted, they and their minions (McCahn, Conway, Short, Pence, Ryan, et al), have managed to dismantle regulations, change departmental enforcement policy, gut enforcement staffs, and run off dedicated professionals who protect us from people like them (oh hell, specifically them).\n\nThe Koch's are the real enemy folks, and they are playing us like a fiddle."
'"the Koch network told its surrogates to downplay concern over the deficit, a major issue they raised during the Obama administration, in order to convince lawmakers to support the package."\n\nThis has been the case ever since Reagan ran under deficit reduction in the 1980s, and then tripled the annual deficit once in office.\n\nDemonize deficit spending when Democrats are in charge, then pile it on once once (R)s take over.\n\nJust watch.  If the (D)s take over, deficits move right back up to the top of the things "conservatives" (in parentheses because the few remaining real ones have all been driven from the Republican Party) care about.   For now, it\'s perfectly OK to add nearly a trillion a year in a time of prosperity.\n'

"And that's why you saw the Republicans at the state of the union address so ecstatically cheering for him.\n\nWith no political opinions of his own and no experience or interest to inform his choices, if you've got his ear, you can get him to do just about anything. \n\nAll those policy changes you've always wanted that no mainstream politician, nor anyone with an interest in their own political future would ever agree to are within your grasp if you've got an [R] next to your name. \n\nAnd the beauty of it is that he's so good at generating moment-to-moment controversy that no one will notice what you've gotten him to do. And even if they do, everyone else is doing the same thing. Your meddling is a trifling little time bomb that's some other generation's problem.\n\nAll you've got to do is pamper his vanity a little."
'What’s striking is the different mindsets of liberal and conservative billionaires. Take Bill and Melinda Gates - they spend all their time and money trying to improve the world - save lives, reduce poverty, etc. They have stated their goals of donating 95% of their net worth before they die! That is insane! Then you have the Koch brothers and their ilk, who spend all their time and money on trying to get more money at the expense of the environment and those less fortunate. Really puts a perspective on how certain people choose to live their lives. I sure hope karma is taking note.'

"These two especially effect the US elections way more than any Russian can. There's only so much effect a foreign country can have on policy and elections without any inside access to the politicians themselves. The Koch brothers essentially have the ability to try force through anything they want through the Republican party. Any foreign power at best can try cause chaos and hope someone they like or have a relationship with rises out of it like a Donald Trump. That's still one politician even if it is the most important. The Koch brothers can rely on the best part of 300 of them at a national level and thats not counting aides, advisors and other people who work in politics. The US system is specifically built so that the 300 can overrule the 1 (what they did to Obama for 6 years) which is a good thing until the politicians dont even pretend to listen to their voters"
'>The Koch brothers are also hoping to fundamentally reshape other aspects of American society, including labor unions and the judiciary.\n\nI honestly do not understand this mentality. Why would a super rich guy who is in his 80’s give a frick about politics? If I was rich and only had a few more years to live I would be lying on a tropical beach somewhere sipping Mai Tai’s. \n\nLike even if they achieve their goals of changing American society they won’t be around to enjoy the fruits of their labor anyway. Why give a shit? Enjoy life you only gave a few years left. So weird to me.'

"Has anyone considered that Trump is actually doing this on purpose?\n\nConsider:\n\nTrump never actually wanted to be President of the United States.\n\nTrump hasn't really ever had any particular loyalty to the GOP. He's run in the past in the Reform and Independent parties, and I bet he'd have probably run for the Dems as well if he'd though he stood half a chance. \n\nMy theory is that Trump is actively working to NOT get re-elected and if it fucks the GOP and even the country at large then so be it. He's selfish, narcissistic, and only concerned with Donald Trump (and to some lesser degree his family, I'm sure. \n\nI think he is trying to figure out how to get out of this pickle he's gotten himself into and doesn't care who he fucks over so long as he's free of the burdens of the Presidency.\n\nOr, you know, maybe he's just a fucking moron."

They are only seeking the reassurance of someone who always tells them they are the best, they are special, and their hardships can always be blamed on someone or something else. \n\nIntelligent people are confident because they have done the research, verified their knowledge, and constantly challenge it with new ideas and information. Insecure and small-minded people fake confidence as a way of rejecting any ideas that challenge their own. \n\nTrump himself is a whole other kind of narcissistic psychopath, but the system that created him and gave him power is a bunch of people that will not care one bit what he actually says or does, only that he keeps telling them how great he is, and how great they are for supporting him.

One way to communicate to Hitler is to actively lie in front of him. You can do it to directly cover for him, or just to sew discord.\n\nThis shit keeps happening because it's a loyalty test.

"An indictment against Broidy seems almost inevitable at this point.\n\n> The plan is outlined in a series of emails and other documents obtained by The Intercept. Broidy and Baev did not dispute the authenticity of the exchanges but said the deal was never consummated.\n\nConfirmed 100% authentic.\n\n> Baev was introduced to Broidy in October 2016, before Trump was elected. At the time, Broidy was serving as a top fundraiser for the Trump campaign; he would later become vice chair of Trump’s inaugural committee before transitioning to his most recent position at the RNC.\n\n> Broidy began sharing drafts of his lobbying plan with Baev by December. That month, he also sent Baev a Wall Street Journal article headlined “France Poised for Pro-Russia Pivot.”\n\nAnother pre-election collusion puzzle piece\n\n> In January 2017, Baev wrote to Broidy asking whether McCain’s bill would put their efforts at risk. “The client is asking how our road map would be affected by a new bill sponsored by Senator McCain to codify the existing sanctions and to impose new ones as a matter of federal law which the Administration will not be in a position to lift without consent of the US Congress. What are your thoughts on this?”\n\n> Broidy responded: “We need to convince McCain to abandon or water down the bill while we push the admin and other members of Senate to water down and vote no. Not a game changer.\n\n> In a proposal dated February 23, 2017, Broidy told Baev that he had found “many influential experts, lobbyists, and attorneys” who were “willing and able to work immediately on your behalf and on behalf of Novatek.” The document, marked “strictly-confidential, attorney client privilege,” lays out a plan for a two-year influence campaign that Broidy claimed could dilute McCain’s bill and lift sanctions by February 2019.\n\n> The plan outlines a 25-step “Roadmap” that includes getting buy-in from congressional Foreign Relations committees, as well as outreach to the White House, the Treasury, and the Commerce, State, and Justice departments.\n\n> It also lists “issues for Congress” that would have to be overcome in order to implement the plan, including progress on agreements to resolve the situation in Ukraine. Congress would also “need information as to whether Russia did indeed hack DNC and attempt to influence US Presidential election,” according to the document.\n\n> Broidy added: “Congress would require agreement with Russia that Russia will not do so again.”\n\nHoly shit.  Looks like Broidy had very little doubt about what the Russians did in the 2016 election if he's drawing up a plan that must as a necessity factor it in."

'This is exactly the tit-for-tat arrangements that I expected to be uncovered by the investigation.

Trump, his family, and associates, all frequent visitors to Russia.  Business plans in Russia.  Secret meetings in Russia.  Russia suffering serious sanctions from previous administration.  Hillary no friend of Russians.  Russia the world\'s greatest at collecting and using intelligence.  Trump\'s business dirty enough that he is probably open to blackmail.  Ample evidence of Russian trolls employed to swing the election.  Russian oligarchs have tons of money and no morals.  After the election Trump has only positive things to say about Russia.  Slow-goes and opposes all sanctions. \n\nSoon we\'ll learn that everyone involved got ample favors and payouts from the Russians in exchange for their cooperation.

"Those who cheer the withdrawal of the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action are not being informed by facts. Facts available to them, presented by the IAEA and corroborated by European allies and even the President's current Defense Secretary, General Mattis.\n\nLet me be clear. It is fine to have a different opinion as to whether or not the JCPOA is extensive enough. It is fine to hold the opinion that we should not have entered into any agreement at all.\n\nBut, if you're going to hold those opinions, then they are in direct contradiction to the facts presented by international observers, experts and even your own Defense Secretary's stated position.\n\nWe can disagree about policy. We can disagree about the specifics of the multilateral agreement. We can disagree about the degree to which Iran is an existential threat to the United States.\n\nBut we must be able to agree on the facts and we must be able to agree that those facts are not in dispute. Otherwise we've nowhere to go from.\n\nIran is compliant with the nuclear agreement. That isn't an opinion. It's a fact. And as they are compliant, then it is us -- and not them -- who are in violation of the terms of the agreement if we renew sanctions.\n\nUs, not them.\n\nWe are not necessarily the good guys by definition all of the time.\n\nAnd in this instance, the United States is making a mistake that compromises the international security climate, in spite of the advice of European allies and in spite of the facts presented by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the decision taken by President Trump makes the world less safe."

'My favorite thing about David Cay Johnston is the positively condescending way he repeatedly refers to Trump as, "Donald."

'I am not a Trump supporter by any regards but I was in the crowd last night and I would like to make a few comments on how the media looks at his speech. \n\n1. We may have booed Obama for not coming to the Jamboree but the entire speech was done in a non serious tone. \n\n2. We were not held there against are will, every scout had the choice to go or not and as being part of the staff band, we were begging administration to let us play Hail to the Chief for him. \n\n3. While he did get political at some times, he had some good points about leadership and the scouts values and good points about success \n\nAll the scouts here at the Jamboree are looking at the way the media are portraying his speech and sitting back in horror with the ability of the media to take everything Trump said and put a negative spin on it. None of us here are Trump supporters, but as good scouts should we will stand by what is right and the media is not right in this case'
"So, here's the message I sent BSA:\n\n I'm a former Eagle Scout, camp counselor, and adult volunteer. I also have a young son that I was looking to sign up for Cub Scouts when he was old enough.\n\nTo me, scouts played a valuable role in turning boys into men, teaching them self-reliance, responsibility, care for others and for the earth, and honor.\n\nA Scout is Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Kind, Obedient, Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, Clean, and Reverent.\n\nI believe in what lies behind them as well, that a scout is called on to improve himself, to develop a firm moral character and to take on challenges so that he grows from them and can step up when needed and be relied upon, to the benefit of himself, his community, nation, and the entire world. And that you should always strive to make people and places better than how you found them.\n\nI believe in those values and they are in evidence across scouting. But it would be a mistake to pretend that they are universal across scouting. Just like any organization, there is a fair bit of darkness in scouting, often with leaders who do not hold those values, who mistake the trappings and uniform and order and discipline for the core of scouting and provide bad examples and guidance. Or ones that just have their own agenda that they want to push despite how inappropriate it is to put before any children, let alone scouts.\n\nThe speech by President Trump was wholly inappropriate to be given in front of Scouts at the Jamboree or really anywhere. It constantly violated the tenets of Scouting and is a degradation of the organization. In that it affected them and provided them with an example, it did individual damage to the Scouts who attended.\n\nIs this the character that BSA stands for? My experiences and the established guidelines of scouting says not, that instead this is the very opposite of who we are called to be. But, without the strongest condemnation coming from BSA and guidance to individual troop leaders on how to contextualize the President speech and explain why it is not what we believe or want our kids to use as an example, it looks like the organization either approves of this or at the very least lacks the moral character to take a stand against it.\n\nAnd that's not an organization that I can support nor would I want my impressionable children to be guided by."
'I know a ton of people who attended this and it was basically a massive Trump  support  party. This article is complete bullshit.'
'As a troop leader not only in BSA, but also having been active in the world scouting organization as an leader in [Hungarian Scouts] (http://cserkesz.hu/) including helping restart the movement by training Hungarian Scout Masters after 1989, this speech should not merely renounced in the US as being political, but also needs to be addressed by the entire [World Organization of the Scout Movement] (https://www.scout.org/) to redirect the messages included in his speech. This is because his speech is, to its core, dangerous.\n\nI hope everybody watches [the whole speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16Ge_HEeIuI), especially those of us who were/are scouts. They will understand **why** it is dangerous. Trump correctly identified our strengths and our values in certain cases. This provided a connection and got people interested/engaged. But he then politicized them to say that "if you embody X, you must believe/act as Y." At ~10 minutes in, the part about getting the votes to kill Obamacare and getting the votes or you\'re fired is **not** a scout message. Yes- recognizing the scout spirit is important. But celebrate a man for working hard, not for doing a specific thing - specifics are political, our values are (hopefully) universal.\n\nAnd that is the second part of the danger - we *are* trying to help teach the next generation that they are part of something bigger, that they are to emulate the leaders we put in front of them, and that our values should drive our behavior. Thus normalizing statements like "you\'re workers, but you wouldn\'t mind a few years like that" cause major problems (19:35). Because now he hasn\'t just created a parallel between our values and certain political leanings - he has now taken those values and trivialized them to be a means to an end.\n\n**Scouts live by our values because the values themselves are good, not for any other reason.**\n\nThe part that worries me the most as somebody who has worked in multiple NSOs of the WOSM is that Trump brought in the military. First, a disclaimer. My best friend is a former Marine, my brother-in-law was a career officer in the Navy, my father Air Force, and I myself multiple years of JROTC. I think the military is necessary, and I am proud to be an American, to have one of the greatest military forces on earth, and of the men and women who serve. But as a Scout, I need to remind leaders of two things. First - while BP did come from a military background and bring in the discipline of the military, Scouts are *not* a military organization. And more importantly - Scouting is a **world** organization. Saying things like "a great Scout\'s name will be *feared* and revered" shows he doesn\'t get the *why* of it all. Scouts come together at world Jamborees and find commonality, unity, and community. We do not use words like *fear*.\n\nI will be reaching out on both sides of my NSOs, because I will not let Trump redefine *our* moment to further *his* agenda. This is not tolerated anywhere else in the world - I hope the WOSM reminds Scouts everywhere that *we* own our vision, not any politician.'

"As an Eagle Scout that attended the 2013 Jamboree (they're done every 4 years), I personally met all politicians, dignitaries, and company executives that attended the event because I was asked to play piano for a private summit dinner.

It was unfortunate that Obama couldn't make it but honestly I'm sure there are MANY more important things he could be doing rather than attend an overhyped Boy Scout circle jerk.

'As far as i can tell, there is evidence of collusion which would appear to be a contribution in kind (basically a non-cash donation) from a foreign source, knowingly accepted by people in the Trump campaign.  So illegal campaign contributions.  Normally this only results in fines, but if you knowingly and willingly accept it you can get jail time.\n\nMultiple people may be guilty of perjury.\n\nMultiple people may be guilty of obstruction of justice for trying to (and actually) firing Comey and perhaps trying to interfere with Mueller.\n\nBut the biggie would be if there is evidence of a quid pro quo exchange: election help for dropping sanctions, for example.  They have evidence that these may have been discussed ("adoptions") but I don\'t think we\'ve heard evidence of any kind of actual agreement.  If there is evidence then those who knew would be part of a criminal conspiracy.\n\nAnd of course aside from the obstruction of justice in firing Comey (which I have a feeling might be allowed to slide if it is the only thing against him), Trump Sr himself is not directly connected to the crimes committed.  It\'s always through someone else and thus some plausible deniability.  For example, Trump saying what Wikileaks suggested 15 minutes before?  There\'s no (public) evidence that Sr knew it was from Wikileaks, and might have only known that Jr suggested it.  Personally, I am certain that Trump Sr knew (his attitude towards Putin and Russia is a dead giveaway) but Mueller still needs to have evidence.'

It just has to be uncovered.\n\nSo basically Newsweek is taking the metaphysical approach to this. In this email account there is and is not proof of collusion, at the same time until you look into it, also there\'s a dead cat somewhere . You people are just too funny in your paranoia.'

"This will be probably be an unpopular thing to say but...\n\nI am starting to think the Trump campaign might have actually been too incredibly stupid to mastermind this whole thing. I do however think Russia was not. They got their money's worth in a candidate who couldn't run a McDonalds much less further the United States' influence in the world. The campaign members were so downright inept they got railroaded into doing what Russia wanted all the while thinking they were the smartest guys in the room.

"On the other hand, a third of the young people actually approve of his performance. That's incredible to me. The scandals are a daily fixture of Trump's presidency.  \n\nIf you look at the stats, over the last 200 days, according to 538's aggregate of all polling, Trump has actually gained net approval rating. Although he's still below Obama and Carter in terms of net approval rating, his trajectory is actually going up. In the same amount of time, Obama started at 62% approval and dropped down to 48% in a linear rate. Carter started at 70% and dropped down to 42% in a linear rate. The only recent Democratic president who didn't have a downward trajectory was Clinton who started at 60%, dropped down to 39% at just over 100 days, which is below Trump at the time, before climbing back to around 56%. \n\nTrump on the other hand, started at 45.5% approval - the worst ratings in history, dropped down to 36.5% at its lowest and now, has started climbing to over 40% again. What has he down in the last 200 days that warranted the climb? He has been dialing up his fascist tendencies, giving tax cuts to the rich, congratulating Russia, firing all that opposed him, hires warmongers and sycophants into high positions, and is no longer even overt about obstructing justice. He's been more emboldened by his lies and just does it. I have never seen anything like it, it's not a hyperbole when I say that everything out of his mouth is a lie. It's just incredible. And yet, he's gaining popularity and approval. The rightwing media has gone off the deep end along with him too, attacking children and survivors of school shootings, comparing victims to Nazis. The GOP nominations in special elections included literal Nazis, child molesters, and convicted felons. What's more the president pardons them and even endorses some of them. Trump can just announce something on Twitter about international agreements at the drop of the hat, often ignoring his advisors and when anyone criticises him for it, they'll just get fired. \n\nAs a foreigner, I don't think America can come back from this. On the international stage, who is going to believe that America will be stable in the future? Even if in the future, somehow you get a smart, sincere president with good character, who's going to believe that he/she won't just get undermined in every turn and then after four years the population would just flip and install another crazy person? It doesn't matter what policy you agree with, this amount of unpredictability where every four years, the country can just take a 180 degrees turn is impossible to work with. \n\nIt's going to get darker before you see the light. Not only do the young people need to win the next elections against the GOP - they also need to hold onto power for the next several decades in order to prove that once again there's stability in the country. However, with a country with such polarization - how does that even happen?"

Mr. Trump has denied collusion by him or his campaign, and Moscow has denied meddling in the election.\n\n>Separately, the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday said senior White House official Jared Kushner hadn’t turned over all the documents it has requested and asked his lawyer to be more forthcoming.\n\n>Congressional committees earlier this year asked the campaign to turn over Russia-related documents, emails and phone records dating back to June 2015, when Mr. Trump launched his campaign.\n\n>**Sending a subpoena to an entity that says it has been cooperating with document requests isn’t unusual in cases in which prosecutors have some concern that their demands aren’t being met promptly or aren’t being entirely fulfilled,** former prosecutors said. **A subpoena can serve as a backup, to make sure the recipient is complying as promised, and as a reminder that failure to provide documents as demanded would count as obstructing a grand-jury investigation.**\n\n>Mr. Mueller’s team had previously issued subpoenas individually to several top campaign officials, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Mike Flynn. Mr. Manafort currently faces charges including money laundering and tax evasion.

The team has interviewed several officials who worked with the campaign, including Reince Priebus and Sean Spicer, who went on to serve as White House chief of staff and press secretary, respectively. They have since left the administration.\n\n>**Congressional investigators, meanwhile, have expressed dissatisfaction with the document productions from top Trump officials, including Mr. Kushner,** the president’s son-in-law and former campaign aide who now serves as a senior White House adviser.\n\n>On Thursday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.), the top Democrat on the committee, said in a letter to Mr. Kushner’s attorney that the response they received to an earlier request was “incomplete.”\n\n>In their letter, the senators mentioned a document that Mr. Kushner had forwarded involving “a Russian backdoor overture and dinner invite.”  The letter doesn’t give other details about the material. A Judiciary Committee spokesman didn’t immediately respond to questions about the document.\n\n>The senators addressed the three-page letter to Mr. Kushner’s attorney, Abbe Lowell. In a statement after the letter was made public, Mr. Lowell said Mr. Kushner had been “responsive to all requests” and had provided documents related to “Mr. Kushner’s calls, contacts or meetings with Russians during the campaign and transition, which was the request.”\n\n>**More to come**\n\nEDIT: Formatting'

'I found these three paragraphs notable.  Seriously, I want that last paragraph unredacted.  What was Page up to?  Jesus.\n\n> Steele\'s sources reported that Page met separately while in Russia with Igor Sechin, a close associate of Vladimir Putin and executive chairman of Rosneft, Russia\'s state-owned oil company, and Igor Divyekin, a senior Kremlin official.  Sechin allegedly discussed the prospect of future U.S.-Russia energy cooperation and "an associated move to lift Ukraine-related western sanctions against Russia."  Divyekin allegedly disclosed to Page that the Kremlin possessed compromising information on Clinton ("kompromat") and noted "the possibility of its being released to Candidate #1\'s campaign".  [Note: "Candidate #1" refers to candidate Trump.]  This closely tracks what other Russian contacts were informing another Trump foreign policy advisor, George Papadopolous.\n\n-\n\n> DOJ was transparent with Court about Steele\'s sourcing: The Committee Majority, which had earlier accused Obama Administration officials of improper "unmasking", faults DOJ for not revealing the names of specific U.S. persons and entities in the FISA application and subsequent renewals.  In fact, DOJ appropriately upheld its longstanding practice of protecting U.S. citizen information by purposely not "unmasking" U.S. person and entity names, **unless they were themselves the subject of a counterintelligence investigation.**  DOJ instead used generic identifiers that provided the Court with more than sufficient information to understand the political context of Steele\'s research.  In an extensive explanation to the Court, DOJ discloses that Steele:\n\n> > "was approached by an identified U.S. Person, who indicated to Source #1[Steele]  that a U.S.-based law firm had hired the identified U.S. Person to conduct research regarding Candidate #1\'s ties to Russia.  (The identified U.S. Person and Source #1 have a long-standing business relationship.)  The identified U.S. person hired Source #1 to conduct this research.  The identified U.S. Person never advised Source #1 as to the motivation behind the research into Candidate #1\'s ties to Russia.  **The FBI speculates that the identified U.S. Person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1\'s campaign**"\n\n-\n\n> **FISA was *not* used to spy on Trump or his campaign.**  As the Trump campaign and Page have acknowledged, Page ended his formal affiliation with the campaign months *before* DOJ applied for a warrant.  DOJ, moreover, submitted the initial application *less than three weeks* before the election, even though the FBI\'s investigation had been ongoing since the end of July 2016.\n\n> The Court approved surveillance of Page allowed FBI to collect valuable intelligence.  The FISA renewals demonstrate that the FBI collected important investigative information and leads by conducting Court-approved surveillance.  For instance, ███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████.\n\n> DOJ also documented evidence that Page ████████████████████████████████████████████, anticipated ███████████████████████████████████ and repeatedly contacted █████████████████████████████ in an effort to present himself as ██████████████████████.  ███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████.  Page\'s efforts to ██████████████████████████████████████████████████ also contradict his sworn testimony to our committee.\n\n*edit: added better looking redacting.  Also, want to add this:*\n\n> **In subsequent FISA renewals, DOJ provided additional information obtained through multiple independent sources that corroborated Steele\'s reporting.**\n\nWhat follows that sentence is three paragraphs in three bullet points, almost all redacted, except the phrases "in Moscow", "senior Russian officials", and "meetings with Russian officials". Yikes.'
'>FBI and ofcials did not abuse the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) process, omit material information, or subvert this vital tool to spy on the Trump campaign.\n\nPretty sure most of us already knew that.\n\n>Christopher Steele\'s raw intelligence reporting did not inform the decision to initiate its counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016. In fact, the FBI\'s closely-held investigative team only received Steele\'s reporting in mid-September more than seven weeks later. The FBI and, subsequently, the Special Counsel\'s investigation into links between the Russian government and Trump campaign associates has been based on troubling law enforcement and intelligence information unrelated to the "dossier."\n\n\nThat too. The GOP has been compromised. This war of the dueling memos sparked by Devin Nunes resulted in:\n\n* Legitimizing Christopher Steele.\n* Vindicating the F.B.I. and D.O.J.\n* The GOP being exposed for their partisanship.\n* Devin Nunes looking like an ass.\n\n'
'Interesting that this doesn\'t say Page "might be" or is "suspected to be" a Russian agent, it says he IS a Russian agent.\n\nI wonder where it says he visited Moscow <redacted> how well "on behalf of Donald Trump", or something similar would fit in that redacted space.'
"TLDR Fucking nothing in Nunes Memo was true. Big Points\n\n1.) There is a detailed paragraph in the October warrant application outlining who Steele was. That he was hired by a U.S Person to do the research. The the relationship was a business one and long standing, and that the FBI believed he was hired to do research for purposes of discrediting Trump campaign\n\n2.) The Russia investigation started 7 and a half weeks before they even became aware of Steele's information. Completly debunking it was basis for anything\n\n3.) The FBI at no time during the election had any surveillance on the Trump Campaign. Page surveillance started months after he left the campaign.\n\n4.) The Yahoo article that Nunes memo went nuts about, was simply used as a reference to a public denial that Carter Page made about his travels. There was also a 2nd news article referenced as well Nunes Memo doesnt talk about\n\n5.) On subsequent renewals DOJ made clear that Steel was removed as a source, and why. In no way shape or form was this hidden from the coruts.\n\n6.) Of the renewals, it was approved 4 different judges, 2 which were appointed by George Bush, 1 by George H.W Bush and 1 by Regan. All Republican appointees\n\n7.) Each renewal in part was approved because the previous ones resulted in substantial intelligence\n\n8.) Steele at no point was ever paid by the DOJ or FBI for the dossier or anything else"
'PAGE 3, End OF PARAGRAPH ONE:\n\n>... the FBI had already opened sub-inquiries into ~~XXXX~~ individuals linked to the Trump Campaign ...\n\nThis is of interest because the redacted section is likely the number "FOUR" (or possibly FIVE, I\'m hearing from many other people). The FBI appears to have been investigating ~~10 or~~ more individuals with direct connections to the Trump Campaign.\n\n~~Iirc, this is a far larger number than has been revealed thus far. This is, as noted, assuming that the number actually is double digits, which it appears to be in relation to the surrounding font.~~\n\n\n\nEdit to add, from u/corporal_jones:\n\nJust did an experiment. Put \'127\' and \'67\' into Microsoft Word, 12pt Times New Roman. "Highlighted" them in black to look like a redaction.\n\nThat redaction on page 3 is the shape of three digits / characters.\n\nIt is possible that the redacted number is followed by a + symbol or preceded by a less than / greater than ( > / < ) symbol.\n\nPart of the final redacted character in that section is visible. There is scope for further investigation here...\n\n**SECOND EDIT:** Most posts below seem to be in near-unanimous agreement that the redacted area is the word \'four\' (possibly \'five\'). I think they\'re right. It fits perfectly as someone showed by typing it over the redaction. It also accounts for the sloppy redaction that left part of the final character unredacted and there are other factors people pointed out.\n\nNow, aside from Page, who might those others be, considering we now have more publicly available info than we did at the time of the events in the memo?'

"This is what history looks like. Historians will use these threads to look at people's opinions in this time of history. TD will be used by psychologists to figure out how they got like that. "

Nothing we don’t already know, but nice to see it cleanly organized and laid out. \n\nAs with any good pinup, the redacted parts make it sexier. \n\nCan’t wait to see the Rosneft info when it’s finally hung around Trump’s neck. There’s a reason we don’t hear much about it right now. '
'this might be a good time to remember that Carter Page [has appeared before the grand jury for testimony](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/us/politics/trump-campaign-page-russian.html?smid=tw-share) \n\n> Mr. Page was questioned by the F.B.I. earlier this year and has also appeared before the grand jury as part of the special counsel’s inquiry.'
"So the tl;dr version of it is: Nunes purposefully lied and stretched the truth *at best*, but also didn't read some of the underlying intelligence for that memo.  Furthermore, the Russia investigation began long before the FBI was aware of the Steele dossier, and was backed by much more intelligence than just that one document."
'Love how the Republicans’ reaction to this Democratic memo like it just confirms that the FBI acted deceptively by putting the source of who was paying Steele in the footnotes of their request. In legal writing, the footnotes are EXTREMELY important. Every attorney and judge reads the footnotes when they’re going through documents. It was not “buried” or “hidden” lol. The Republican desperation is at an all-time high now.\n\nThe Republicans are just blatantly ignoring the fact that the Democratic memo states that parts of Steele’s dossier were independently confirmed to be true. So, another Republican talking point (the dossier being unconfirmed) has been blown up. '
"I think the most interesting thing here of all is how Christopher Steele has been made out to be some guy off the street or something. I feel like even journalists haven't really described his credibility in detail. He's helped the FBI numerous times before. He's legit. So that right there is almost enough to trust that this Dossier is legit alone."
"So the WH held up allowing this publication until the best time for them politically. In the evening, on a weekend. Surprised they didn't do it during the shooting last week."

"So she's not a _stupid_ hypocritical asshole, just a regular hypocritical asshole? Great."
"Despite everything I think (and this all speculative) that Melania is the least fucked up individual in the Trumpshere.

'Handy reference for folks - she is violating:\n\n[The Anti-Nepotism Statute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/3110) which was passed in 1967 in the wake of JFK having RFK serve as his Attorney General, so yes - it addresses EXACTLY what\'s going on here.

Well, what it actually means is that you cannot perform work for the Federal Government without allocated funds and a contract in place. The reason for this is to prevent Ivanka from presenting OMB with an invoice in September for all the work she\'s done (which she would be legally entitled to do). Given that she is perfectly justified in doing so, then there would be no appropriated funds to pay her with. That\'s why doing work for the government for free is illegal. \n\nAlso note that since she has not been nominated by the President and approved by the Senate, then she\'s working in violation of federal hiring policies. \n\nAnd since she\'s "just kind of working around the White House" yet the President has obviously given her some measure of authority, we have an Executive Department official whose job is undefined, with no indication of what her responsibilities are or what her authority is.

The day-to-day doesn't change much so it's hard to notice the little things slipping away, behaviors previously deemed incomprehensible are suddenly normalized. \n\nWe are at very crucial point in American history. We believed that our system would save us, that Republican Senators and Congressmen would stem the tide of a wanna-be dictator. We didn't anticipate, that in order to maintain their loose grip on power, they'd ally with him. \n\nMake no mistake, Trump would like nothing more than to turn the FBI and DOJ into his own personal pack of dogs, attacking anybody who dares go against him. Honestly, I don't know what's standing in his way anymore. The GOP refuses to stand up to him, content with satisfying their donors and maintaining their seats. After all, being allied with a dictator is far better than being in opposition to him, no? \n\nWe keep thinking things will get better, that Mueller will somehow save us. I don't know if that's true. Our last hope is the 2018 elections. We have to hold Trump and the GOP accountable for their actions. "

"What the hell do we do now? I feel at such a loss here - Voting these traitors out won't have any effect for another _year_. Sure, protest, write to our reps, but honestly I feel like that isn't enough.\n\nDamn it all."
"Quoting/doubleposting, but I really want to spotlight the [Monday Demonstrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday_demonstrations_in_East_Germany) in the former German Democratic Republic for your consideration for direct action. Every Monday between September 1989 and March 1990, citizens turned out peacefully to protest against the regime. The numbers were impressive both in absolute and relative terms (nearly a quarter of all citizens of Leipzig turning out towards the end). But what really made a difference was that they weren't a one-off, but a ***sustained, weekly*** gathering of people in any weather and circumstance.\n\nAlthough the downfall of communism in Germany is obviously multi-faceted and very complex, I can personally confirm, having lived through those years, that those protests made a massive difference in the regime's handling to the situation, the external perception of the GDR, and leading eventually the fall of the Berlin Wall, free elections and the reunification of Germany.\n\nIf I was American I would totally try to organise something like those demonstrations. 7pm on a Monday - **every Monday** - in all major (or even minor) population centres, is doable for many people, even if they work a full-time job. It would send a powerful message that you are many, that you feel strongly enough about it to come out regularly, and that you won't go away."
"These are really strong words for having come from Paul Ryan.  Either someone's pulling on his leash pretty hard or there's some really good dirt on him floating to the surface.\n\nEDIT: Option 3; Ryan's remarks will dominate news cycle for a while, distracting us from something else.\n\nI'm interested in what other members of both houses will have to say about Ryan's remarks."
'Yep.  Expect a lot more of our nation\'s various law enforcement agencies to be "cleansed" and remade as GOP/alt-right organizations.

'As soon as the NRA got swept up in this, Republicans rhetoric changed. Citizens United has allowed the Republican party to take money from despots who seek to expand their power now it\'s time to pay the Piper...Putin.\n\nThis, however, is where lines get crossed; Democratic and Constitutional. Ryan calling for a "Cleanse" sure sounds a lot like Stalin calling for a "Purge." Instilling law enforcement institutions that protect one party while attacking another are the Bedrock that props up Fascism. Never in my lifetime did I think I would see a political party and its base so radicalized that a Purge of Law Enforcement was not only proposed by a leader of a party but celebrated by Americans that have the gull and delusion to think of themselves as Patriots.

'I’ll preface this with saying I am not an American.\n\nI feel like the republicans must have some reassurance that these midterm elections will somehow end in their favour regardless of actual votes, in order for them to be going off the deep end like they are.

Look at the shenanigans Clinton pulled in 08 to try and beat Obama. Look at the 2012 GOP primary where Ron Paul was essentially blacklisted from the media even when he won.

'The reason America\'s reputation is headed to the toilet is only partly because of Trump\'s actions. What Trump has done is reveal the fact that half of America approves of his actions. That is what scares people overseas. \n\nOften in the past you would hear people say things like "I love Americans, but I hate their foreign policy or I don\'t like their leaders." But Trump has made it clear that it is Americans themselves who are largely the problem. Too many of them are supportive of these things. That is why it will take so long to repair America\'s reputation. Even if the next president is highly respected, people won\'t forget that the GOP and their supporters wanted to align with Russia over Europe for example. '

'The Emoluments Clause prohibits public officials from accepting personal gifts (and titles) from foreign governments.\n\nAs far as I know, Trump has zero financial interest in ZTE, which is owned by the Chinese government.

'> Vanity Fair reported on Wednesday that a top American spy told Israeli intelligence officials during a meeting at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, a few weeks before Trump\'s inauguration that US intelligence believed Russian President Vladimir Putin had "leverages of pressure" over Trump.\n\nThat seems to corroborate the Steele dossier that was first released in January by Buzzfeed.

"And conservative Israelis will support him regardless since they know he'll let them do what they want in the mideast. \n\nObama would have been impeached, and perhaps removed from office for this single act. Amazing how these things work."
"Here is what i don't understand - the Steele Dossier has been floating around intelligence circles since mid 2016. It was written by a well respected former British intelligence operative and it clearly outlined that Trump had been compromised by Russia. Given that Trump was already the Republican nominee by this time, you would have thought that any foreign intelligence agency would have been looking into the Steele dossier in an attempt to verify its claims. If Trump was compromised, it meant that if he became President, any intel they shared with the US was potentially also compromised. It would represent a massive security vulnerability.  At the very least, you would imagine all of the big intel agencies would have been looking into the Steele Dossier, even if the US wasn't. So hadn't Mossad already formed a view as to whether Trump represented a security vulnerability?\n\nSo is it possible this kind of intel was fed to Trump just prior to his meeting with the Russians to determine if indeed he represented a security vulnerability? They may have wanted more concrete evidence. The timing is interesting. **Trump met with Lavrov and Kislyak on May 10. Robert Mueller was appointed as special counsel on May 17.** So perhaps this intel from Israel was used as a ploy to test Trump. And the fact that he leaked the intel precipitated the appointment of Mueller.... "

When will we start to realize (or at least pontificate) the very real chance that Trump is nothing more than a buffoon and grifter who faked his way to the top?\n\nIf Schumer\'s account of last week\'s budget meeting and the hold that Trump\'s aides had on him we\'re accurate, we need to stop with the narrative that Trump is being clever, or cagey, or has any idea at all of what he\'s doing.\n\n'
'>Although there\'s some debate among legal scholars about how much latitude the president would have for such a purge, Trump\'s previous maneuvering in this investigation suggests he believes he can do almost whatever he wants. \n\nTo me this is the defining Trump mentality, "I can do whatever I want, whenever I want, however I want because what is good for me is good for America." \n\nAnd coupled with his win at any and all costs just underscores his thinking that he doesn\'t see The American Presidency as an elected office but rather, "I won it, it\'s mine, so I get to do whatever I want, however I want, whenever I want; Get over it."\n\nAnd the unfortunate reality for all of us is that aforementioned view of the Presidency is seemingly held a by a very significant amount of Americans who often treat the Presidency as if it is a divine appointment, and anyone who doesn\'t fit their profile is a usurper of all that is Republicany goodness.\n\nWe all need to change our mentality about the Presidency...it is one leg of a three legged government stool...it\'s not the center-pole bar stool of which all that is America rests or falls...\n\nAnd...I am concerned that a lot of Republican voters see the Presidency as a throne put there by the will of God, and suitable only for those whom God wills it to (also, be determined by the chosen few aka conservative Christians)...and that thinking needs to be unlearned.\n\n'
'I kinda feel like Muellers waiting for it. It would only help an obstruction case.'
'>But the president, a survivor to his core, had to find some novel way of explaining why he was trying to escape the clutches of an obstruction of justice investigation by obstructing justice.\n\nWell put.'
'Let\'s not get ahead of ourselves, Trump may or may not try to fire Mueller again. I think it\'s too presumptive to say he "will" try again. However, I think it is important to consider what we as US citizens should do if he does in fact fire him. Like the top comment in this post states, we need to go to the streets and demand his removal. '
"From the article:\n\n>If McGahn is now in Mueller's crosshairs, he might have decided that the simplest solution is to cooperate with the probe and turn over information in exchange for gentler treatment.\n\nWouldn't he have to resign from his position to cooperate? Seems like it would be a conflict of interest and/or violate attorney/client privilege otherwise. IANAL, though, so maybe someone could confirm...\n\nIf that's the case, since he hasn't resigned yet, I'd assume he's not currently cooperating in the manner that type article suggests"
'That\'s not how to get Trump to do what you want.  \n\nHere, try this:\n\nCompare: "Obama would never be brave enough to interview with Mueller"\n\nFlatter: "Trump is so strong and clearly did nothing wrong, if he let Mueller finish his job he would be adored by all Americans"\n\nDistract: "We\'re going to bring those big truck back to the while house lawn"\n\nIt would help immensely if it were Fox news saying any of these.'
'The founding fathers foresaw a Trump but what they did not imagine is that the majority party would be unwilling to do their jobs and protect our institutions from a demagogue. Our system is built on the trust in our legislative branch to do their jobs and check the executive but Republicans have failed us all. '
"The electoral college was supposed to prevent this bloated asshole from even getting into office but yet here we are.  We can't rely on dead men that lived in the 1700's to handle our issues in the 2000's.  "
"Much as I love dunkin' on Trump, I hate our deification of the founders. Yeah they almost certainly were smarter than this buffoon, but that's a pretty low bar and they didn't know everything. Talking heads reference them like some sort of hyper advance ancient alien species."
'To be fair, everyone is smarter than he is.'
"I don't know if they planned for the complete... failure, abdication, corruption?... of one of two major political parties.  Our institutions only work if they're operated in good faith, and the Republican party has proven its willingness to operate in bad faith to see its goals carried out.  And unfortunately the only reason the Republican party has for existing is to hurt brown people, poor people, gay people, and women, while concentrating more and more wealth in the hands of a few primarily old white men.  I hope that our republic can survive it."
"I'll agree that they planned for a president to go off the rails, however they didn't plan on partisan politics allowing the legislative branch to be completely in line with it. If we make it out of this alive, I would hope the blue tidal wave in 2018 and 2020 passes legislation about pardoning powers of presidents whose staff is being investigated"
'> “One might ask, if this is all a big witch hunt and Mr. Trump has nothing illegal or untoward to hide, why does he care about the privilege in the first place?” the editorial board wrote. “The answer, of course, is that he has a lot to hide.”\n\nThe above is from NYT Editorial Board. Honestly, why does Trump keeps crowing about this if this is something about a nothing burger. That reminds me of his oft repeated comment from campaign - "Only guilty take the 5th". He should shut up and work on what he has been elected for rather than watching TV and tweeting endlessly.'
"That's damning the founders with faint praise. There are squirrels more intelligent than Trump."
"Beautiful sentiment but it has a major flaw: While our Constitution may be filled with checks and balances to limit the power of a president, those machinations are constituted entirely of people. If those people abdicate their role in limiting the president, then there's not much limit to what he can do. \n\nOur forefathers may have planned for a Donald Trump, but they didn't plan for a spinless and sycophantic Congress divided by tribalism and committed to nothing other than their team winning so that their re-election campagins could be properly funded. They didn't plan on what is essentially State Media hammering the president's message into the public over and over again with exaggerations, half-truths, and outright lies in order to galvanize large swaths of the country in their support of an autocrat.\n\nOur Constitution isn't worth the paper it's printed on without leaders in place who are prepared to uphold it."
'I love the quote "America is stronger than you because our forefathers were smarter than you and they planned for you". It summarizes exactly the essence of what makes this country so great.'
'I think this is a positive way to reach trumps base. “You guys love America right? And you love the forefathers?” \n“Duh”\n“Well did you know they were trying to prevent a future tyrant like trump from overthrowing their government with these laws that he is breaking?” (List all the laws trump is breaking and considering breaking)\n\nYou have to get very simple with it. Like talking to a child. Then go back and explain why breaking these laws could destroy the country they love. '
"I wish I believed that the Republicans would impeach him if he did that, but they won't.  They've shown time and time again they value: campagn donors, party, country, in that order."
'well, that’s pretty much gonna guarantee he tries to fire him. can’t stand having his big beautiful stable genius brain insulted.'
"The forefathers did not anticipate having a rule that you can't just make your resort and high rise hotel your White House and charge the secret service lots of money to protect you.\n\nTrump is obviously smarter and found all the best loopholes. He also takes his morning constitutionals in the Rose Garden and it's rumored the plants are loving it. The best fertilizer.\n\nCheckmate founding fathers."
"Sounds like he's daring that fat orange llama to do it..."
'Donald is going to make us love America again by proving how amazing the government works when qualified people (like Mueller) are doing their jobs.'
'That is a wise comment. The founding fathers were pretty darn smart. '
"This forefather worship always gets a chuckled out of me. Modern US politics upholds the constitution as a sacred, immutable text but also a living, breathing one. I'm pretty sure a lot of these amendments are being misrepresented, and the forefathers lived in a completely different world where a lot of modern issues were simply unpredicatable. The US political system is barely working right now, so this talk about planning for contingencies like this is just lip service. Trump has already done a substantial amount of things that no other POTUS would have done before for fear of reprisal and legal consequences."
'That doesn’t sound like an ethical thing to say for an ethics chief'
'Not only were our forefathers smarter than him, my daughter is smarter than him.\n\nMy daughter will be three weeks old on Sunday.'
'They were great people. They are why we shouldn’t repeal the 2A either. '
'Jeez, I wish I was as confident as this guy.'
'>Thursday afternoon, the president tweeted a message that took a more subdued tone than that of his cable news spinning allies: "I have agreed with the historically cooperative, disciplined approach that we have engaged in with Robert Mueller (Unlike the Clintons!). I have full confidence in Ty Cobb, my Special Counsel, and have been fully advised throughout each phase of this process."\n\nThis well written text was obviously provided by someone to Trump.  He then added that idiotic parenthetical about the Clintons.    His handlers must just cringe when he does this. '
'Yet more obstruction of justice rofl'
'These are definitely the actions of an innocent man.\n\n/s'
'I guess the comforting thing here is that all these WH insiders who constantly leak things like this to the press are probably also completely fine cooperating with Mueller and giving him way more information than we see.'
"The idea that your actions are justified legally because some punndit approves of them is ridiculous and certainly wouldn't hold up in court"
'At this point if he does fire Mueller, I really this country revolts and overthrows him the old school way. What a message that would send to leaders here and around the world. It would probably inspire more people to rise up and smack down their oppressive regimes. I get that a lot of people will do nothing, but if we have hundreds of thousands marching on DC, which is what I hope it would and not just some bullshit "chant slogans and complain while not really doing anything" protest like they usually are, then we could really change things. If this happens, its not a "spreading awareness" moment. Its a surround the WH and don\'t even let Trump walk outside moment. I hope people understand that. '
'Bold strategy. This is basically the definition of obstruction of justice. '
'Interesting.\n\nNixon didn\'t have the right-wing propaganda machine that is Fox "News" back when he did this. I bet he would have survived if he did, if he was able to manipulate it like Trump is attempting to do here.\n\nHonestly we are at a point where the people that think this is OK -- that he should be able to fire all these people -- those people that believe that shouldn\'t be allowed within 100 yards of any building political building. They should not be included anymore.'

I struggle to understand why conservatives support this guy so fervently.'

"Trump supporters will say the fake polls gave Hillary a >99% of winning. But 538's calculations had it as a 70/30 race, and [their aggregate polls](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?ex_cid=rrpromo) agree that Trump has had the least-approved year of any modern president. Only Clinton (for a couple a months) and Ford were close."
'Even if the polls were off by the margin of error in the swing states, there was not a single poll that was off by the magnitude needed to flip his approval ratings. Neither Clinton nor Trump won any state where the polling aggregate showed the other side winning by double digits. \n\nMeanwhile, his approval ratings are about the same as Bush\'s were in December of 2005, while the Generic Congressional Ballot is about 3 points more favorable right now than it was in that same time frame in 2005 (and is actually a tad bit higher than it was at this point in 2008, when Dems were slaughtering Republicans up and down the ballot with an 11 point lead). He\'s managed to endorse the losing candidate twice in Alabama and once in Virginia, all while pulling out all the stops to help those candidates win. Republicans are privately concerned about a 40 seat Dem pickup being almost the median size of the impending 2018 wave (and for comparison, Democrats were privately mulling the same numbers in reverse in 2010, which ended up being a 60 seat Republican pickup), and their operational Senate majority might get reduced to 49 because of prolonged absences by Senators McCain and Cochran. \n\nMaybe at the beginning of all of this, in the first half of the year, the polls were still looking good for Republicans. They came off of Congressional special election wins in a number of districts (that their previous holders won handily), and made the Democrats spend a fortune in GA-06 (although it wasn\'t $50million on one side as the Trump folks like to claim, but more of a $30million/$20million split between the parties) only to lose. The summer and the fall are already starting to look awfully different. Democrats outperformed the polling average in Virginia and caught lightning in a bottle by winning Alabama. The Republican base never stopped showing up in these races either - Gillespie got more votes than any gubernatorial candidate in history, Northam just got way, way, more. Instead, there has been a surge in turnout among POCs and young people. The Alabama Senate election was pretty much specifically scheduled so that young voters wouldn\'t be able to vote as much (on account of finals and the holidays), too.\n\nTaking stock of 2017, 2018 is going to make Trump think there were fake elections at every turn. There are clown cars\' worth of Democrats clamoring to run for elections in blood red Oklahoma, while a number of special elections in Trump country are starting to smell like upsets. Trump winning PA-18 by 20 points did nothing to deter a qualified candidate like Conor Lamb, a former federal prosecutor and Marine veteran who prosecuted sexual assault cases in Okinawa and who also hails from a political family, from challenging Rick Saccone, a man who claims to be "Trump before Trump". With murmurs of Charlie Dent resigning early instead of retiring, and the possibility of Chris McDaniel being the nominee in at least one Mississippi Senate election, a bunch of special elections are going to be getting much more heated. Sounds like a bunch of "fake" polls and "fake" news are in store for the President in the new year.'

In reality, all the work he does is what a president is supposed to do. \n\nRemember that, before becoming President, his job was scamming investors and contractors, and then covering up his tracks with PR stunts. He probably spent most of his work time "doing business" by golfing with potential investors, or dining in lavish restaurants. He\'s not used to the serious work that is the presidency, but he has too much pride to quit and make his "haters" happy. '

"[Brennan, Clapper, Hayden, Rice, Comey and McCabe](https://twitter.com/axios/status/1021471265901678592): Two CIA directors, Two FBI directors, a National Security Advisor, and the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nIt's a bottomless chasm. Either the entire intelligence apparatus of the United States is corrupt, or Donald Trump is."
"[According to Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-23/trump-weighing-revoking-security-clearances-for-comey-brennan), the officials are as follows:\n\n>John Brennan,\xa0James Comey,\xa0James Clapper,\xa0Susan Rice and Michael Hayden, and also former FBI official\xa0Andrew McCabe, because they have used classified information to make politicized statements, White House spokeswoman\xa0Sarah Sanders\xa0told reporters, Bloomberg News reports.\n\nEdit: Full article has been posted.\n\nhttps://www.apnews.com/0b21fcaf283a4139a5b27cf017fea03f/Trump-considering-revoking-ex-Obama-officials'-clearance\n\n>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is considering revoking the security clearances of a half dozen former Obama administration officials and critics of his presidency.\n\n>White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday that the president is “exploring the mechanisms” to strip clearance from former CIA director John Brennan, along with former FBI director Jim Comey, former national intelligence director James Clapper and others.\n\n>Sanders is accusing the officials of having “politicized and in some cases monetized their public service and security clearances” as well as “making baseless accusations” against the president.\n\n\n>Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky tweeted earlier Monday that he was planning to raise the issue of revoking Brennan’s clearance at a meeting with Trump.\n\n>Brennan last week described Trump’s press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin as “nothing short of treasonous.”"
'These individuals need to stop being referred to as "Obama Officials"  In the case of Brennan, Clapper, Comey and especially Hayden, they have been around through multiple Presidential Administrations.  These are CAREER UNITED STATES PUBLIC SERVANTS and Intelligence/Law Enforcement Professionals.\n\nThey deserve more respect than this.'
"Blessed be the fruit! \n\nDon't mind me, I'm just practicing for the future. "
'**Up Next:**\n\nTrump "exploring" or "throwing the idea out there" on letting Putin sit in the Oval Office in the Presidential Chair and running America for a week or so. This is because Putin told him personally of how much he loves America and he wants to get first hand experience on running the great United States of America.'
'In the end I think this would be a largely a pointless move, since those involved are private citizens now, and thus likely wouldn\'t be granted access to classified info anyhow (no "need to know"). \n\nHowever, it does come across as extremely petty and an attempt to allow for future discrediting. So, classic Cadet bone spurs.\n\nEdit: Apparently it\'s routine for these former directors to be called into classified meetings to give testimony or to give advice to those who took over their positions. Not being able to do that is a hit on the intelligence community as a whole.'

Trump doesn\'t have that kind of discipline.\n\nIf Trump were wise, he\'d take inspo from maybe Franklin Roosevelt, also a pasty, puffy scion, who saw a country in crisis and listened to the experienced politicians around him - everyone hates Hoover, but Hoover\'s top advisors wrote the Emergency Banking Act because they\'d seen the dumpster fire firsthand for long enough that they had some theories about how to put it out. Roosevelt just sold it to the American people via a poignant Fireside Chat on national radio. Isn\'t Trump supposed to be good at getting on TV and convincing people he\'s competent? Roosevelt instituted federal programs and public works projects. Big government is great when it does good things for people, and as a Democratic Socialist (that\'s Bernie\'s party) I think we should expect our government to do good things, and we should contribute to their efforts.\n\nIf you want insight into Trump, go to /r/raisedbynarcissists. I\'ve already started worrying about that asshole Mike Pants (I closed caption the news for a living, and my captioning software printed that one day.) I\'ve been worried about him since Trump was elected, because we all figured this would happen, right? '
"I'm very interested in how this bill will be spun as a positive change. It seems to be worse in every way than previous bills and doesn't seem to even pretend to attempt to increase coverage."
"My family Cigna insurance costs almost $1000/month through my husband's employer. They refuse to cover my 2 year old son's autism treatment. There is an autism coverage mandate in most states but Tennessee is not one of them. We live in Colorado but our insurance policy is through Cigna of Tennessee. Their CEO makes almost $200,000 per day. Anyway...raising premiums sounds really awesome. I can't wait. I'm glad we've made America great again. "
"FWIW, the odds are kind of stacked against Graham-Cassidy passing, you certainly don't see McConnell whipping for headcount. \n\nThat being said I'd encourage anyone in Alaska or Maine to contact Murkowski or Collins respectively to express their opposition, particularly on the grounds of PP's defunding. I'd also recommend anyone from Kentucky calling up Rand Paul and lying about how Graham-Cassidy isn't destroying enough people's lives.\n\nEDIT: Doubling down on people in Alaska needing to call Murkowski ASAP, she is signalling an undecided stance when she had previously signalled a 'no'. This is a circumstance in which individual voices can make an absolutely massive impact, make yourself heard! "
"Pretty soon insurance markets will get so efficient that the premiums will match the costs you pay, plus the insurance fee.  \n\nIt will be just like you don't have insurance, but more expensive. "
'I think some people don\'t understand the difference between "insurance" and "protection racket/blackmail."\n\nYou are giving companies money in order that if something unlikely happens, you will be covered. They make significant profits from those events and payouts being less than their premiums.\n\nEssentially they now want legal protection to not do the sole thing they are supposed to do. \n\nPay out.

"I'd be interested to hear one fucking reason a private insurance company would want to lower rates to help people. They're in it to make money. It's a business. I would never bet on a private health insurance company being good natured and helping humans."
'TLDR: If this is true you might as well not have insurance\n\nIf this becomes true, than their is literally no point in having health insurance at all, you only need it mostly when your sick, but if you have to pay for it when you are well, and get it taken away when sick, you might as well not have it in the first place. \n\nI almost feel as if capitalsim will help take care of this on its own, because you would basicly be paying for nothing under this system.'

'In high school a guy I was friends with asked me for a ride to a funeral for a guy at our school who killed himself. I felt bad for him, they were friends, and said sure. I was tiny, like 110 lbs and he was a bigger guy on the football team. \n\nWhen I dropped him off at home he grabbed my keys and wouldn’t let me out of the car unless I kissed him. He grabbed my hands and wrists and started kissing me. Then he started making more demands, like my parents aren’t home let’s go inside the house. \n\nI told him I had to be home within like 15 minutes or my parents would call the cops. He threw the keys at me after that and told me to leave. \n\nI felt so gross and disgusting and never told anyone - not my parents or friends. I had to see him in class every day after that. If he was running for President now and other women came forward with similar stories I don’t know what I would do. \n\nI know people would ask why I waited so long, people would make fun of my looks, people would question my story. I can’t prove any of it and I’m sure he would deny it. These women are incredibly brave. '

"This is pretty important. It's confirmation at the time it happened. This is an FBI Deputy director saying this stuff happened, not some low level agent."
"Can we stop and think how odd this is?\n\nFormer and current high level FBI personal are saying the president of the United States of America wanted a loyalty pledge.\n\nThat the president than lied about it. Not once but multiple times. \n\nOnce the loyalty pledge was not acted upon to the presidents liking, the FBI director was fired. \n\nI cant see any president ever doing something like this. It's so out there, so out in left field. Is it part of the theatrics to gather our attention. Either the president is a attention seeker to no end or something is up. \n"
'I don\'t know how to understand "I need loyalty" as a requirement to the Director of the FBI, in any way that doesn\'t involve either criminality or abuse of power or both.\n\nWhy would the executive need the loyalty of the police? The police either do their job or they don\'t. They are supposed to build criminal cases against those who have committed crimes and they are supposed to leave the innocent alone, and their motivation is supposed to be the fair application of justice.\n\nThe only contexts in which it would matter if a police officer is "loyal" to the executive is if the executive wants crimes overlooked or wants specific people, possibly innocent people, to be prosecuted for personal reasons.\n\nAt some point this has to either stop, or we have to admit that the President of the United States is above the law and above any expectation that we might have that he needs to respect and defend the Constitution, and to represent all of the people of the United States in good faith.'
"The great orange thin skin asked a whole stadium of supporters to raise their hands and pledge loyalty to him. Hundreds if not thousand people to raise their fucking hand and pledge loyalty. And they fucking did it. That moment scared the shit out of me.  It is not a fucking stretch to consider he asked Comey for the same loyalty. He is like a stupid version of Hitler just bashing his way through shit until something sticks. With his fat ass and vagina neck. Fun fact. Hitler would never be seen in a bathing suit and either will Trump. Hitler had a micropenis, and if it wasn't for the account of the thirteen-year old that Trump made put a condom on him before the deed I would have guessed the same. "
"What's the news here, though? Just that it proves Comey didn't make that up?\n\nEdit: all right, relax, I wasn't aware Trump was even challenging the loyalty stuff. It's a stupid thing to challenge."
'Republicans are cool w a man who believes personal loyalty to him is more important than loyalty to the Constitution. didnt they take an Oath ?'
'Lol republicans are going down in history as supporting a traitor'
"I still do not get why this charade is still going on.... he explictly told Lestor Holt he reason in firing Comey was *because of the Russian Thing*....... and he then *asked Russia* to find those *missing 30 THOUSAND Emails*..... he did not ask ANY of OUR Intelligence Agencies.... if he truly has nothing to hide why not show his taxes as that ought to clear this up and why is it that the IRS is not allowed to release those taxes whenever they are damned good and ready? regardless of the owners *consent* as it is supposed to be a public matter as we *all* pay taxes even if you inheirt money you still have to buy things and those things are taxed... and so is the inheirted income albeit now (soon) it won't be Thanks to Trump (sarcasm).... or a LOT less (YUGE) than it was before he got *his tax bill*."

'This will get buried, but I work in DC politics. There are certain positions that require Presidents nominate Democrats to positions (random boards and such). I can confirm all of them have been asked about their loyalty to President Trump...Obviously none of them have agreed, and all of them have straight up told WH stooges that "No, I\'m a democrat and I voted for HRC."

'He says he’s helping American companies by getting rid of regulations. Sure it earns them a little more but we don’t have regulations just as a fuck you to businesses.

'Pretty sure Japanese PM Shinzō Abe has been calling for the same thing for years. Considering Trump and Abe just spoke, this could be correlated.\n\nEdit: check the G8 wiki along with various news articles over the last few years, the general sentiment by many countries is that Russia should be back in the G8, so to imply that this makes Trump a "Russian puppet" is absolutely delusional and you would have to call the leaders of many other countries the same for the logic to hold up.\n\n>In April 2015, the German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said that Russia would be welcomed to return to G8 provided the Minsk Protocol was implemented.[9] In 2016, he added that "none of the major international conflicts can be solved without Russia", and the G7 countries will consider Russia\'s return to the group in 2017. The same year, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe called for Russia\'s return to G8, stating that Russia\'s involvement is "crucial to tackling multiple crises in the Middle East".[10] In January 2017, the Italian foreign minister Angelino Alfano said that Italy hopes for "resuming the G8 format with Russia and ending the atmosphere of the Cold War".[11] On 13 January 2017, Russia announced that it would permanently leave the G8 grouping.[26] Nonetheless, Christian Lindner, the leader of Free Democratic Party of Germany and member of the Bundestag, said that Putin should be "asked to join the table of the G7" so that one could "talk with him and not about him", and "we cannot make all things dependent on the situation in Crimea".[12] In April 2018, the German politicians and members of the Bundestag Sahra Wagenknecht and Alexander Graf Lambsdorff said that Russia should be invited back to the group and attend the 2018 summit in Canada: "Russia should again be at the table during the [June] summit at the latest" because "peace in Europe and also in the Middle East is only possible with Russia"'

"This is pretty interesting. By processing the data in the UK, CA might have opened themselves up to detailed information requests that would be brushed off in the US.\n\n>But what was particularly problematic for Carroll was that, he believes, the profile the company sent him wasn’t nearly comprehensive. Nix and other Cambridge Analytica executives have boasted that the company has up to a startling 5,000 data points on each of the 230 million voters in the US. What Carroll received in March, according to his tweet at the time, was about 200 data points, and, even then, it wasn’t clear how or where the company got the data or who it was shared with, beyond the vague descriptions in the letter.\n\n>What’s more, the response came from someone at a British company, SCL, which suggested to Carroll that his data, and presumably the rest of Americans’ data, was in fact processed in the UK, just as Dehaye thought. And if the data had been processed in the US, Carroll suggests, there would be little incentive for them to share it given the restrictive data laws in America.\n\n>But according to the 1998 British Data Protection Act, any company that receives a personal data request is required to provide a “description of the personal data,” state their purpose of processing it, and disclose any people and countries, outside Europe, the data were shared with. A company that fails to comply with those standards, according to the law, is “guilty of an offense.” “As soon as I posted [SCL’s response] to Twitter,” Carroll says, “British academics started saying, ‘Hey, that’s illegal.’” Carroll argues that Cambridge Analytica failed to share the necessary information when he asked. To get the rest of his data—if there was in fact more, as Nix had bragged—Carroll would have to sue.\n\nThe article also includes a look at some of the data they released to Carroll. His twitter feed has a lot of replies saying it's similar to purchasable data from other data firms. CA is of interest to him because of its involvement in the 2016 election, but also because the UK connection gives him a chance to see what a *complete* collection of profile data from a major firm looks like.\n\nThe article also gives background on CA and the conflicting reports of whether their profiling methods are uniquely powerful or just a marketing gimmick."
"I'm sorry but, I wish, and this is my opinion, given the environment of fast, mostly online news, these days, that a writer could, without so many commas, produce an article, edited by, you guessed it, an editor, that is easier to read."
'Regardless of the outcome of this case, kudos to Carroll for going above and beyond in his quest for the truth. Scary that a for-hire private company had such a detailed insight into our voter leanings, and used it so effectively to help tilt the biggest election in the world.'
"Not long ago I've read this super interesting article about how Big Data is/was used to help Trump getting votes. The firm that used this kind of technique was also Cambridge Analytica. Absolutely crazy how they get all their data (through Facebook and so on). Sadly it's only in German, and it's way too much for me to translate :/"
"So... Cambridge Analytica certainly has one of the biggest data sets out there... But progressives use these same tactics too. Connecting various data sets to the voter file to target people for progressive action. Using psychographics is a marketing tactic that works for the left and the right. The difference is the right in this case has amassed more total data points than the left is typically working from, and the right has a fuckton more money to spend on it.\n\n\nIf you're interested in psychographics, absolutely anyone can play around with them on a basic level. Just go to [ads.twitter.com](http://ads.twitter.com) and set up a target audience. It's free to explore how targeting works. Twitter won't reveal to you their actual data profile of an individual, but you can create a highly specific audience with certain interests and leanings, and combine with demographics. You only pay when you actually launch an ad. It can cost you $50 or hundreds of thousands depending on the duration and target.\n\n\nOnce you want to start connecting to the voter file or access scores like these, that's where significant amounts of money can come in at the beginning depending on the size of the dataset. And that's where you can get information actually connected to an individual to target.\n\n\nCambridge Analytica doesn't have secrets. They have tons and tons of data and lots and lots of money to use that data. They created highly customized audiences and uploaded them to Facebook, and then ran an astonishing number of unique ads to target these audiences. \n\n\nGive me the same data and money and I'll find you several million people to sign the petition to impeach Donald Trump. I could also run an ad campaign on Facebook right now just targeting fans of Mother Jones and I'd probably get a lot of signatures from that one data point.\n\n\nThis is the society we've been heading towards for 25 years, since the commercialization of the internet and its technological structure inspired this kind of Big Data. In another 25 years, any company, far right super PAC, or left-wing campaign will probably have your genetic profile, your blood pressure and what you ate for breakfast this morning. \n\nAs dystopian as this may seem, this is a basic reality of the world we're opting into when we exist online. The political will is not likely to be there to permanently reshape Big Data, because all powers on the political spectrum benefit from it, as do the big corporate donors."

'A few days ago a graph was posted that showed fluctuations in how Democrats and Republicans vote. The graph for the Democrats was virtually a straight line.

'>*American laws are much less forgiving.** “If a [British] company has information about you, you have the right to access it, and if you ask for it, they have to give it to you,” Carroll tells Mother Jones. “We don’t have that right in the United States.” In the US, companies don’t need consent to collect its citizens’ data and aren’t legally obligated to share it with them."\n\nmuch **more** forgiving, right?'
'>it wasn’t clear how or where the company got the data or who it was shared with, beyond the vague descriptions in the letter\n\nI work with this sort of software at my job. The answer to this question is *everyone.* Generally it\'s sold as a website plugin and an analytics package. So you put the plugin on your site and it logs visitors. Then it combines the data it collects on those visitors with all the data from all the other websites it\'s plugged into. Amazon, google, your bank, you name it, it all goes into one big database. Then all those companies... Amazon, google, your bank, try and target adverts at you, and they pool resources to do so. Maybe you were researching new houses using google, so your bank now knows to target you with adverts for mortgages. Maybe you just got a new line of credit at your bank, so Amazon knows you have more disposable income.  There are laws that prevent Amazon or your bank from sharing personal data. But they get around those by using these communal databases and instead sharing "metadeta."  They can\'t share what\'s in your account... but they can share that you\'re 10% more likely to buy a new car this month. etc... It\'s all very shady and often even the people using it are in the dark regarding just how invasive it is. '

Flynn has denied that he discussed sanctions with Kislyak. **Flynn met with Kislyak on an social visit to Moscow in 2013, during which he became the first U.S. officer to enter GRU (Russian military intelligence) headquarters**. Flynn traveled to Moscow in December 2015 to attend a gala dinner hosted by Russia’s state-sponsored media giant, RT, where he sat at the same table as Vladimir Putin. He was reportedly paid $45,000 to attend this event. Flynn’s son is also reportedly under investigation, with a focus on the lobbying work he completed for his father’s lobbying firm Flynn Intel Group. On **November 5, 2017**, multiple sources reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team believe they have sufficient evidence to bring charges against both Flynn and his son as part of the ongoing investigation into alleged collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russian government officials. ref: https://themoscowproject.org/players/michaelflynn/\n\n**December 1, 2017**: Michael Flynn pleads guilty to making false statements to FBI agents.\n\n**July 10, 2018**: In the seven months since Flynn pleaded guilty, it’s unclear what assistance he’s provided to prosecutors. The special counsel’s office has not cited him as a witness in court papers so far. But it’s clear prosecutors believed he could be valuable enough to cut him a more favorable deal. In his plea agreement, he admitted to acting as an unregistered foreign agent for Turkey, a federal crime, but he wasn’t charged with the violation. Flynn is not the only person from Trump’s team who agreed to cooperate with the special counsel’s office. Rick Gates, the Trump campaign’s former deputy chairman, pleaded guilty in February. His sentencing has not been scheduled. ref: Judge again delays sentencing for Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security advisor\n\n**July 13, 2018**: The Special Counsel indicts **12 members of Russian military intelligence, known as the GRU**, for engaging in a sustained effort to hack the computer networks of Democratic organizations and the Hillary Clinton campaign. Count 1 Conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, Counts 2 -9 Aggravated identity theft, Count 10 Conspiracy to launder money, Count 11 Conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States. (Period from 2015-2016)\n\nThe indictment tells us \n\n>The hacking and coordinated release of stolen emails is what collusion looks like. The sequence of events offers a clear case study in how the two campaigns to elect Donald Trump—one based in Trump Tower and one based in Russia—colluded.\n\n> 1 - Russia wanted to help Trump and used its intelligence and espionage tools to illegally hack the DNC and the Clinton campaign.\n\n>2 - The Trump campaign also wanted Russia’s help to get the “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. They were willing to work with a foreign intelligence service hostile to the United States to defeat their political opponent.\n\n>3 - These two campaigns then met and coordinated. And when Russia chose to use WikiLeaks to anonymously release the stolen emails, the Trump campaign sought to communicate with WikiLeaks as well.\n\n>4 - The email releases were timed to provide maximum benefit to Trump.\n\n>5 - Trump then made the email releases central to his campaign strategy in the final month. \n\n>Combining Russia’s espionage capabilities with the Trump campaign’s unique and granular understanding of the American political landscape, especially its data-targeting expertise, would have greatly aided both campaigns. The two campaigns met and conversed repeatedly for months, providing ample opportunity to hammer out a strategy to amplify each others’ messages to increase Trump’s chances in the election. The question now is no longer whether there was collusion; it is how deep the\ncollusion went. ref: https://cdn.themoscowproject.org/content/uploads/2018/05/17084235/Collusion-Case-Study-Report-5.17.pdf"

'I can’t say it enough. The social media and DNC hack were bad. The GOP was just as susceptible seeing as how it was a phishing attack that was publicized to be the breach, but they were the favored party; so why would they use whatever they may have found. I’m guessing there *was* a successful phishing attack on the GOP, but there was no need to use anything gained yet.  \nAll of that aside...   \nThey didn’t need to compromise voter roles.  \nThey didn’t need to compromise vote tallies.  \nThey didn’t need to compromise a single voting machine.  \nThey only needed to alter the distribution of voting machines in a couple of key counties in a couple of key states. That would be the easiest *and* most effective way to compromise the vote, and would require exactly zero voter fraud to occur.'

'Maybe it\'s because of the massive financial crash that nearly took down the global economy a decade ago, persistent financial instability following it and stagnant wages for over 30 years.

Why if it were true why did many districts that voted for Obama twice switch to Trump in the 2016 election? This isn\'t because of the ebil republicans (if you recall the republican establishment HATED trump) it\'s because of massive inequality and reduction in standards of living as well as Americas slow decline from undisputable global hegemony.'

"Don't forget the racism that the modern Republican party was built on. It's one of the main ingredients that brought us Trump."
'I agree with this headline. There’s a strong trend of anti-intellectualism in the Republican Party. You can find it in the Obama years or Republican conventions, as well as in Trump. They’ve been denying reality and definitely distracting for quite some time. \n\nOne needs only to look at New Gingrich [dismiss crime statistics](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xnhJWusyj4I)  with “Americans don’t feel safer” to realize that, or they can watch subtler forms like Romney’s quip about America having less ships than any point since 1914 against Obama’s detailed response about how the nature of our military has changed because of technology and urging that we look beyond the surface numbers to the real power of our navy. Who’s the intellectual, and who’s misleading? Pretty obvious. \n\nCompare [politifact’s breakdown of both parties’ national conventions](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/lists/people/republican-and-democratic-parties/). Let’s say each true statement is +2 “reality points,” each mostly true is +1, each half true 0, etc. to -3 for pants on fire. Democrats end up with 10 reality points, Republicans with -11, once you add their totals in the conventions.\n\nThat being said, I think this article could have made that case better. It gives only two specific examples, one of which is trump in an article about how this goes beyond trump, of anti-intellectualism. If you want to make a case about the character of a party, I think you have to support those claims more substantially (things like “Republicans hate it when Democrats mention the Lippmann and Dewey ideas on democracy” and linking to nothing but an explanation of them). There are examples of conservatives making these claims (just sift through Fox News or prager u). Put those in the article. You’re right...validate it!'

"So, I have always said that I thought the most dangerous actor w/r/t Trump after the election would be China because this is how their culture operates. \n\nFavors, gifts, corruption, power-broking... Guangxi.  \n\nRussia is just straight naked corruption, but the Chinese have a whole society built up around their connectedness.  Trump, et. al. Are being played the fool by a group of powerful people in China who are working together with a plan, and guess what, America's interests are not included in that plan. Unlike Russia, they are subtle enough that people can make excuses, and push things under the table. No uranium poisoning from China, it's not their thing.  Trading in Petro-yuan, however, or a deal on a building somewhere, or an investment in something, or even sacrificing a pawn so they can get what they want. That is their MO.\n\nSure, trump will get a deal, or a gift, or some non-essential trinket of appreciation. But the chess game is moving around him and America is going to get check-mated by the Chinese unless we get rid of him."

"Seems like Trump is doing the shotgun method of nominations. Throwing a ton of nominees up that are at the least in favor of him or generally republican with wildly varying degrees of intellect, experience, and logic. And then just seeing what sticks. \n\nIts a devious tactic as it could be an attempt to essentially wear down congress so his real yet to be named nominations get picked with much less resistance than if they were the first nominees.\n\nThis is the most logical conclusion I could come up with and I think I'm giving trump too much credit.

'Since “loyalty to him” is the only quality that Trump considers, it follows that Trump’s nominees are universally low on qualifications and intelligence. Trump has not been able to attract people with significant accomplishments, respectful reputations, or suitability to serve. '

'Funny that Trump was surprised by the insane right wing candidate winning a republican primary in Alabama.

'And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed – if all records told the same tale – then the lie passed into history and became truth. "Who controls the past," ran the Party slogan, "controls the future: who controls the present controls the past." And yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been altered. Whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting. It was quite simple. All that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory. "Reality control," they called it: in Newspeak, "doublethink."'
'"I have always supported Moore to represent the great district of Eastasia"'
"It would be (slightly) reassuring that it was precisely Trump's tweets of support that meant Strange lost. If you have half a brain and read that Trump supports a candidate, that surely means you'll be voting for absolutely anyone else. "

'I have a student who by all accounts is an American. They have been here since 4 years old. They speak perfect English, they know American culture, they strive to get good grades, be a good kid. They are genuinely interested in certain subjects and they have asked me to borrow my science books. They are in a leadership organization, they want to work for non-profits when they get older because they care about other people and they are passionate about ideas. This is a special kid. And there are people in this country who would gladly see them deported to a country they have never known. They are a scared teenager. They just want to live their lives. And the future is uncertain for a kid with all the accumen to go out and do great things. And this is the person we are going to deport? It breaks my heart I have cried my little fucking liberal tears over this news because I fucking care about my students and their futures. \n\nWhy would we rip members of our communities away? '
'If anyone has any questions for a dreamer I will try my best to answer. I was brought to the U.S. when I was 6, my siblings younger than that. I found out my legal status at seventeen. I consider myself American at heart if not legally.'
"God damn. Does Sanders even know the fate of this program or is he pretending to score political points?\n\nBecause its not politically feasible to make DACA recipients legal citizens, many dems seem to prefer them being in this legal limbo where their fate of deportation is postponed every few years or months. \n\n\nKeep in mind that the federal judge already ruled  a similar program  called DAPA, unconstitutional. So chances are, DACA is going to be ruled unconstitutional too. \n\n**So even if Trump didn't end DACA, its going to be scrapped by the federal courts in near future.** \n\nSo my prediction is going to be Trump ending this program anyway because his supporters will pretend he did something good.

'
'Well that’s simply where you and I have a difference of opinion on the people brought here without their consent. Most of them have proven themselves to be good, hard working, educated people... who’d make fine citizens for our country.\n\nI think,!along with many people, conservatives & progressives alike, we should give these certain defined group (aka Dreamers) a path forward. And at the same time overhaul all the immigration laws to be clear, efficient, and standardized. So that nobody will fall into this trap... maybe that’s somewhere we can find common ground??\n\nThe slippery slope argument is a not a real argument... as we already have a specific definition and criteria for these people. Anyone falling outside the definition aren’t included.\n\nAlso, I’m sure you realize that immigrants of Mexican and Latin origins were once very strong supporters of conservatives and republicans all the way up through the 90s. Gee, I wonder what changed??'
"I'm an attorney and I have done a few DACA applications, from a full service walk-through to just document review. And what struck me most about DACA applicants weren't how bright or promising they were, but just how normal they were. Just Americana. I know DACA supporters talk up the potentials and future promises but that's really not the point, in my opinion. These guys and girls were just normal American teenagers. Not all of them would go on to be doctors or engineers. But they will be credible and productive members of America in their own ways. You want assimilation? They are fully assimilated. They speak English, and quite a few of them are either rusty or at most passable in their mother tongue. Almost all of them thought they were US citizens and grew up accordingly, loving this country and planning their futures here. \n\nI'm sure some of them will be exceptional. And some of them won't be. But they have the same probability of success or failure as US born because they are in fact them. Seriously, these DACA kids are exactly like everyone else. In fact, I'm hesitant to call them assimilated because they didn't assimilate, not any more than their friends who were born in the US.\n\nSecondly, I've had the happy experience of telling them that they were granted DACA, and the emotions were... raw. Most of these guys were more bewildered than anything to have to go through the process. Like I said, most of them didn't even know. They thought they didn't have a driver's license because their parents thought it was too dangerous to drive. A lot of them didn't think it was a big deal and were pushed into it by their parents. It's usually a huge struggle to let them know the value of this. Through the process, they learn. And they realize how precarious their situation was. And once they receive notification, it's... like they're getting validation for who they think they were. It's like they grew up thinking they were Americans only to be told they're not, and then finally being told they are in fact Americans and they have access to all the dreams and hopes they had when they were growing up. It was an emotional experience for all around."
'Obama\'s creation of this problem circumvented Congress with an executive order that far exceeded what any other president ever did.\n\nWe American citizens did not cause this problem, but their parents, who brought them illegally into the country.\n\nIf parents steal $10 million and bring up their children in lap of luxury - private schools, global  travel, must we citizens retain this lifestyle if the parents get caught when the kids are 14 and 16? Oh, who will pay for their $50,000 a yer college their parents planned, the trust funds of $1 million each in their names? The kids are innocent after all.\n\nOne of the most effective purposes of punishing people for breaking the law is an example to others with larceny in their hearts, this would serve as a good example to the millions of foreigners thinking of coming to the U.S. illegally.\nIf these kids are given amnesty, millions of future illegals will have an added incentive to come here now, thinking, "well, even if we get caught, Americans will keep our kids there and take care of them.\n\nThe 1986 amnesty "immigration reform" act stated explicitly that it would be the last amnesty to illegals ever -- about 5 million received amnesty. Now leftists want to give amnesty to at least 11 million new illegals (bet there are a lot more).\nIn 20 years, we\'ll have 30 million new illegals demanding amnesty.'
"I'm confused-\n\nIf DACA recipients are skilled and educated (they are), why can't they come back legally under a legitimate work visa? Or get legitimate citizenship?\n\nFrom what I've seen in my social media, my legal immigrant friends are celebrating this decision almost uniformly.\n\nI'm legitimately asking, not trying to be snarky. I don't see the problem with making everyone do things legally on this issue."
"> The president tweets at everyone who crosses him. Why hasn't he tweeted at you?\n\n> **He can't handle a direct confrontation with me. He knows that I'll hand him his ass.**\n\n> So you think he's afraid of you?\n\n> **I do. And I think he should be.**\n\n> How do you think he chooses his targets then?\n\n> **He chooses targets that he perceives to be weak. Like most bullies.**\n\nI would pay good money to have this slipped into Trump's daily briefing. With pictures, of course. "

'Stupid, isn\'t strong enough of a word to describe this man.\n\nEdit: Speaking of stupid, Nunberg has been in front of the Grand Jury for over ~~3~~  ~~4~~  ~~5~~ [SIX](https://twitter.com/ZoeTillman/status/972206410686697472) hours now.  \n\n>Nunberg\'s lawyer Patrick Brackley just passed us in the lobby of the courthouse (no Nunberg), we asked how much longer it\'ll be and he said, "Who knows"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ZoeTillman/status/972162207961305090\n\n(You don\'t get to take your lawyer into the Grand Jury room with you.  It\'s a secret proceeding.  Only the Grand Jurors, witness, prosecutors, and court reporter are in the room.  For the defense attorney, this is where you generally pop a xanax and pray to your god of choice.)\n\nEdit: To answer a bunch of the questions I\'m getting:\n\n1) No judge either.  Maybe a court security officer depending on the type of case and court.  But no judge or other neutral party is in the room.\n\n2) Can the witness ask to be excused to ask his lawyer a question?  Absolutely.  But remember, Grand Juries also have an investigatory function.  If you ask to leave to go ask your lawyer something, this tips off investigators to what you\'re concerned about.  Also, how great do you look to the Grand Jurors?  They think you have something to hide, and are trying to figure out a way to avoid answering the question. \n\nSo yes you can, but not always a very good idea to do it.  Similar tactical strategy concerns as pleading the Fifth.  \n\n3) I have no idea the "why" Grand Juries are like this.  I don\'t really like it or think it\'s completely fair myself.  But it is what it is, and has always been that way.  They\'re spelled out in the Constitution as a right we have.  But my experience is indeed, that a skilled prosecutor can get a Grand Jury to indict a ham sandwich. \n\nUpdate:  Nunberg is done.  Spent about 6-7 hours with Mueller\'s Grand Jury.  \n\n[But Andrew Weissmann just entered the building.

"I'd like the New York state bar association to get more pro-actively involved.  He has publicly said that he used his own personal funds to pay a settlement on behalf of a client.  That is at least one, and likely two violations of the code of ethics.  1) paying expenses for your client with your own money - it may seem nice but it's not allowed.  This is in theory a good rule because it keeps an attorney from propping up a client's case (paying their rent, etc.) in order to hold out for a bigger payout; it keeps the client's motives honest and realistic.  You aren't even supposed to be able to pay a client's bus fare to come to court.  $130k is not a small violation.  2) accepting and acting on a settlement on behalf of a client without the client's knowledge or consent - this is to be presumed based on what Cohen has said he did and how involved Trump was.  1 is a relatively small violation normally, but the size of the payout might be an aggravating factor.  2 is a huge violation and could lead to disbarment.  Where is the New York State Bar on this?"

'This is how Trump operates. He cares about "winning." If this had anything to do with safety, security, or any of that nonsense it would have been a done deal because he\'d have worked with everyone to get something actually beneficial.\n\nBut that would involve going back on his old Muslim Ban, so he\'s just going to keep re-trying it, changing it slightly and slamming it through over and over again until (he hopes) one actually sticks, and then he can hold it up and act like he\'s not the shittiest president ever. '
'In other words, one of Trump’s “wins” that his supporters celebrated was premature. '
'"We will have so much winning if I get elected that you may get bored with the winning, Believe me, I agree, you\'ll never get bored with winning. We never get bored. We are going to turn this country around. We are going to start winning big on trade. Militarily, we\'re going to build up our military.

"This is absurd. \n\nRepublicans and Democrats got into a gun fight. Democrats threw their largest gun in the river hoping that the Republicans will do the same. \n\nFranken was vocal. His name was known as not being on the complete left side of lunacy but a voice of rational intellect. He made sense when he spoke and he spoke when necessary. He was vital when it came to being outspoken about cracked out policies and loved by the people. \n\nDemocrats threw him in the river in order to either gain a potential higher moral ground, despite Franken stating he's fine with an ethics investigation on himself, or sleazy politics when it comes to who's on the Demo ballot for president come 2020. \n\nThey are deluded if they think Republicans will fight any fight nobly, ethically, or cleanly. I have absolutely no faith in that colossal shitshow."

'Franken fell on his sword to push home the point the Republicans would not stand for character.  For about a week , the right wing narrative was "liberals are scum" until more right-wing scum were revealed and scum from the past were resurrected.\n\nFranken essentially said "I disagree with these accusations but for the sake of the greater good, I will resign"...with a string undercurrent of "what will you do about it for your own?"'
'In my opinion, this is all about timing. There\'s a reason why Sanders, Pelosi, and Schumer have been saying, "Let\'s not get ahead of ourselves" when it comes to impeachment. They know that the best time for all of this to happen is next year, especially considering the fact that if the Democrats pick up a majority than speaker of the house becomes a Democrat. If Pence goes down as well, which considering the ties to Flynn he might, then we\'re looking at a democratic president. I think the democrats want to wait until 2018 to start using this against Trump. \n\nForcing Franken to resign "gained" them  the moral high ground and also makes what happens in Alabama a win-win. But I think the big picture with Trump is something they want to exploit later and for maximum impact. \n\nAll of this is just hopeful though that they aren\'t just completely incompetent. I guess we\'ll see.'

'I think this is the most important part of the whole thing:\n\n>"But Obamacare has been repealed in this bill. We didn\'t want to bring it up. I told people specifically \'be quiet with the fake news media because I don\'t want them talking too much about it. Because I didn\'t know how people would - but now that it\'s approved, I can say the individual mandate on health care, where you had to pay not to have insurance, okay, think of that one. You pay not to have insurance. The individual mandate has been repealed."\n\n>-Donald Trump\n\nAfter realizing they couldn\'t take down Obamacare directly, they snuck a way to simply cut off funding into the tax bill and *purposely tried to keep it a secret*.\n\nIf anyone is wondering what this means, it means millions of people are about to be ~~kicked off Obamacare~~ priced out of health insurance, and millions more in the years after that. It\'s no longer a possible future, it\'s really happening.\n\nAlso the middle class had their taxes raised, and corporations had them lowered a massive amount. The middle class are paying for the corporate tax cut with higher taxes and the removal of Obamacare spending.\n\nTo people who think the huge corporate tax cut is a good thing: Every single economist disagrees. Evidence shows tax cuts don\'t create jobs.\n\n>Evidence from 2004, when a repatriation holiday allowed corporations to bring back overseas profits at a lower rate, provides a good case study. The 15 companies that brought the most profits back to the U.S. used them to buy back shares instead of boosting investment, and actually ended up cutting jobs and slightly lowering their research and development spending.\n\nhttp://fortune.com/2017/12/20/tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-corporate-tax-cut-middle-class/\n\nEDIT: Since this blew up I want to clarify that removing the individual mandate means the price of insurance is going to go steadily up from here in, because it\'s going to start a cycle of healthy people dropping their insurance, which will increase premiums for everyone else, which will make more people drop their insurance, which will increase premiums, and so on and so forth. Current estimate is that this will result in at least 10 million people being priced out of insurance over the next 8 years. The system was dependent on *everyone* participating to keep prices low.\n'
'>Along the way, Trump basically admitted that the GOP\'s talking points on the bill weren\'t exactly honest in two major ways.\n\n>While talking about the corporate tax rate being cut from 35 percent to 21 percent, Trump said, “That\'s probably the biggest factor in our plan.”\n\n>The problem? Republicans have been selling this legislation as a middle-class tax cut, first and foremost.\n\n>A sampling:\n\n>"The entire purpose of this is to lower middle class taxes." - House Speaker Paul Ryan, Republican-Wisconsin.\n>"Primarily, and priority number one, is middle-class Americans." - White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders\n>"The theme behind this bill is to get middle-class tax relief for most people in the middle class." - Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican-Kentucky, on Fox News on Tuesday.\n\n>And polls show Republicans have bought into this, with roughly six in 10 believing the bill favoured the middle class over the wealthy - despite the biggest cuts going to the wealthy and the corporate cuts being permanent (unlike the personal tax cuts).'
"People traded $80 bucks a month now for the sure loss of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid in the future. And they're celebrating it as some sort of victory. The short-sightedness of all of this is going to catch up with us eventually.\n\nEDIT: Before anyone goes off on how Social Security probably wouldn't be there anyway. Maybe. But now that we've added $1.5T on top of the debt and Republicans have already stated how they're going to use SS and Medicare to solve these problems, it's almost a sure thing at this point."

And there is possibly some "quid pro quo" going on. Comcast and ATT benefit from Net N, Wells Fargo benefits from being saved from the fake accounts scandal. And Boeing benefits from this administrations gift of federal contracts. And all of them suddenly want to announce how "thanks to this tax plan we are giving back to the people". No, you are paying back the favors given to you from this administration by making an attempt to have the president and his cronies (republicans) looks as if this "trickle-down" crap is actually working. This is unfair to me and all the people on this countries soil.

'I hate to be that guy, but every thing the article mentions about the steps taken to safeguard America after 9/11 were missteps- either they were security theatre measures, attacks directed against the wrong enemy by parties seeking to take advantage of the political climate for personal gain, or knee-jerk reactions that appear to further the goals of the terrorists rather than show the strength of the nation and its ability to bounce back after a set back. Maybe the right thing to do was to calm down and let better judgement take hold before acting. Could Trump have done any worse than Bush?'

"One of the most interesting things about the Trump presidency is its lack of executive branch legal knowledge.

Those legal teams refused to represent Trump because he would often not pay his legal teams, and refused to follow their advice. So he is using his corporate and personal lawyers to aid him, and the constant legal stumbling is a result of that.\n\nWhen Mueller hits his stride, it's going to be an interesting thing to watch. "

'"Make America Great Again."\n\n"America First."\n\n"So much winning."\n\nThat\'s what he promised his dipshit voters.

Trump is a joke, and since he represents us now, so are we. \n\nChina is loving (almost) every second of this. Their primary goal is to overtake us as the main economic and scientific force on the planet, and Trump\'s bumbling of the economy and outright denial of science will help them get there.\n\nRussia is loving every second of this. Their goal is to be taken seriously as a world superpower again. They can\'t claw their way back up, but god damn have they managed to pull us down.\n\nSaudi Arabia and OPEC are loving every second of this. The United States could be energy independent in a few years, if we invested in research and development. Instead, Trump is doubling down on fossil fuels.\n\n~~Germany is loving every second of this. Angela Merkel is now the de facto leader of the free world.~~ Edit: Angela Merkel is a humble and unambitious lady, Germany has no aspirations of world leadership, and the EU would appreciate it if Donald J Trump would fuck right off, thankyouverymuch.\n\nNorth Korea is loving every second of this.

Donald Trump Jr. took that meeting with a Russian lawyer after being promised dirt on Hillary Clinton.\n\n> Schumer called the decision to release transcripts of interviews with Trump Jr. and others at the meeting a "perfunctory move, apparently intended to signal the end of the committee\'s on-again, off-again halting investigation." He said that Senate Republicans have "barely scratched the surface." \n\n> Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the chairman of the committee, said he was releasing the transcripts "to allow the public to know what we know."\n\nQuite a bit of movement regarding these investigations within a short period of time. Coupled with the recent comments about the Special Counsel investigation needing to be "wrapped up" by Giuliani and Pence (the one year anniversary of the Special Counsel investigation is Friday), the end of this week is setting itself up to be a big one.'
"Wasn't this known a year ago when emails from the Trump Tower meeting mentioned that Trump had support from the Russian government?\n\nI know many conservatives live in a different reality, but I thought this has been known for like a year already."

"This explains the Senate Intelligence Committee Dems' support for Haspel [and the release of interview documents earlier today]. This was the trade.

Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), said Wednesday in a joint statement with Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), its chairman. “The Russian effort was extensive, sophisticated, and ordered by President Putin himself for the purpose of helping Donald Trump and hurting Hillary Clinton,” Warner continued.**\n\n>But that last determination — that Russia intended to help Trump — sets up a clash within the GOP over which record of events is most accurate, a dispute that could complicate the party’s messaging surrounding the Russia investigations as it heads into the 2018 election season. While the House Republicans’ report also concurred with the bulk of the intelligence community’s findings about Russian meddling, it accused officials of not following their own best practices in determining that Moscow hoped Trump would win.\n\n\n[Earlier today](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/gina-haspel-trumps-pick-to-lead-cia-wins-support-of-senate-intelligence-committee/2018/05/16/f8c004aa-58eb-11e8-8836-a4a123c359ab_story.html):\n\n>But for Warner, and for the Democrats who followed his lead to also announce their support for Haspel on Tuesday, it was enough.\n\n>“Ms. Haspel’s involvement in torture is deeply troubling, as my friend and colleague, John McCain, so eloquently reminded us. However, Ms. Haspel explained to me that the agency should not have employed such tactics in the past and has assured me that it will not do so in the future,” Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) wrote, adding that she “trust[ed] her word.”\n\n>Heitkamp is one of several senators contacted by former CIA chiefs working to support Haspel’s nomination. Former CIA Director John Brennan contacted her, Warner, and Sens. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) to urge them to vote for Haspel. Three of the four have declared their support. Similarly, former CIA Director Leon Panetta made a personal appeal to Sen.

'Wow the Russian bots are out in full force today.  Obviously these stories are huge. '
'This is pretty interesting.  Trump has called all of these people out as liars save for Rogers.

Former FBI director James B. Comey also was invited.'
'While most of the Republican Party has been an absolute disaster on Trump/Russia, Richard Burr has been a rock.\n\nTwo years ago he would come close to my top ten least favorite positions.

"Sky is blue, water is wet, and Russia was helping Trump.\n\nThe surprising part was Senate Republicans actually willing to say do.\n\nIt's a sad state we have come to when we have to congratulate Republicans for passing even the lowest of bars instead of taking it in stride as something they are supposed to do daily.  Like congratulating an adult for not pissing all over the front of his pants for once."
"The SIC has gotten a few more closed-door briefing than House members have. As I recall, the Republicans on the committee started out toeing the party line pretty clearly, then abruptly stopped and started being quite a bit more balanced about it.\n\nThey've seen a few things I'd guess. "

Actively working with McConnell behind the scenes to force reluctant GOP Senators to get on board with whatever shady back-room shit they come up with now.  (very possible)\n\n3.  Trump is now going to complete his werewolf-like transformation into the second coming of Richard Nixon and **start negotiating with Democrats around some form of single-payer.**  (Though this is, by far, the *least* likely, it is actually the most frightening in the long-term.)\n\nThe main reason I even mention #3 is that Trump\'s ego *has* to be absolutely *fiending* for praise and adoration.  As in, shriveled in a corner in the fetal position, shaking uncontrollably in need of positive attention.\n\n He really *doesn\'t give a fuck* where it comes from.  I think it means more to him than money... which would make sense, because he couldn\'t possibly understand the actual value of money... he\'s never lived without it.\n\nA lot of people might say, "Hey, if it gets single-payer done, I\'m for it."  Which would be fine if everything was only about healthcare.  But it isn\'t.  North Korea & Iran won\'t magically disappear.  Millions of Americans won\'t suddenly *stop* living in fear of persecution or deportation.  He\'s not going to raise taxes on the rich.  Or work for student debt forgiveness.  Or increase funding for public education.  He\'ll still be the same addle-brained bigot he\'s always been, and he\'ll still be the commander-in-chief of the most powerful military arsenal in the history of mankind.'

'This doesn\'t surprise me in the slightest. He couldn\'t give less fucks for anybody in service, he considers them as props and that\'s it. That\'s literally all he sees when he looks at anybody in military uniform.\n\n\nProof: he said so himself to Howard Stern in one of the transcripts we can\'t hear anymore. Stern and he were talking about menstrual sex because trump had mentioned his disgust at the sight of blood, and that led into a tangential story about a gathering at Mar-A-Lago for Christmas, I think.\n\n\nDT\'s account went like this: he had invited about ten or twelve (he couldn\'t remember) Marines so his rich party guests could have photo ops and be able to say they support the troops. DT said something along these lines: "You know they don\'t care, Howard. They couldn\'t care less about these guys but they looked so nice, all dressed up like they were. And they stayed to themselves, I gave them a table at the back--it was a nice table, Howard. Very nice table. And they stayed to themselves most of the night."\xa0 \nAt some point, I don\'t remember why exactly, there was an elderly man on some kind of stage, and he fell off. DT said something like, "Howard, there was-- blood was everywhere, and all the guests, they don\'t want to see something like that, they didn\'t come there to see that, so they turn so they can\'t see it. I turned around too, Howard, I can\'t look at blood, and there was so much on the nice green marble. All over, just all over the place.\xa0 \n"Well these Marines, they\'ve been sitting there in the back, they jump up and run up and, Howard, you wouldn\'t believe how fast they were patching that guy up. And then they did the most interesting thing, Howard. Eight of them linked arms and made a stretcher out of their arms, and do you know they carried that guy out like that, I\'d never seen anything like that before. But there was still blood on the nice green marble."\n\n\nI don\'t remember the rest, I stopped listening to that particular segment shortly thereafter so I don\'t know if DT ever mentioned whatever happened to the old man who apparently had cracked his skull and bled all over Donnie\'s nice green marble. Those are not the words and actions of a person who gives two shits for the military, though. That\'s for damn sure. I really, really wish we still had access to those recordings. What little I explored was very eye-opening.'

I\'d love to see him squirm as an intelligent black man takes him passed the spot where four red roses are always kept in honor of those four little girls. I\'d love to see him act interested as Woodfin explains to him just how bad "Bombingham" was for people of color because of the KKK and how incredibly important Doug Jones\' monumental win was. And then, with cameras rolling, in front of the monument to those babies, have Woodfin ask Trump why he thinks Jones is weak on crime.\n\nIt will never happen.

'She’s sort of a typical spoiled rich kid but she obviously is nowhere near as close to Trump as the other ones.

'> The President said "the hookers thing" is nonsense but that Putin had told him "we have some of the most beautiful hookers in the world."  (He did not say when Putin had told him and I don\'t recall █████████████████████████)\n\nThat\'s kind of a weird thing to say.  Something\'s fishy here.\n\n> He began by telling me that i had had one heck of a year but that I had conducted myself honorably and had a great reputation. He said I was repeatedly out in impossible positions.  He said you saved her and then they hated you for what you did later, but what choice did you have?  He said they thought very highly of me and looked forward to working with, saying he hoped I planned to stay on.\n\nThis completely undermines his and his party\'s attacks on Comey and all of his current talking points.\n\n> I said, the Russians allegedly had tapes involving him and prostitutes at the Presidential Suite at the Ritz Carlton in Moscow from about 2013.  He interjected, "there were no prostitutes, there were never prostitutes." ... He said "2013" to himself, as if trying to remember that period of time, but didn\'t add anything.    I said I wasn\'t saying this was true, only that I wanted him to know both that it had been reported and that the reports were in many hands.  I said media like CNN had them and were looking for a news hook.  ... He said he couldn\'t believe they hadn\'t gone with it yet.  I said it was inflammatory stuff that they would get killed for reporting straight up from the source reports.\n\nThis leg-sweeps his attacks on CNN and the free press in general.\n\n> I had dinner with President Trump in the Green Room at the WHite House last night at 6:30 pm... The servers were only in the room when they delivered food or retrieved plates.  \n\n> The President spoke an overwhelming majority of the time.  He never asked me an open-ended question or left it to me to choose a topic of conversation.  There were almost no periods of silence during the 1 hour and 20 minutes, except once or twice when the President paused as the servers entered.  \n\n> He touched on my future at various points.  The first time he asked "so what do you want to do" explaining that lots of people wanted my job ("about 20 people"), that he thought very highly of me and had heard great things, that the people of the FBI really like me, but he would understand if I wanted to walk away given all I had been through, although he thought that would be bad for me personally because it would look like I had done something wrong... There was no acknowledgement by him (or me) that we had already talked about this twice.\n\n> I responded by saying that he could fire me any time he wished, but that I wanted to stay and do a job I love and think I am doing well.... I explained that he could count on me to always tell him the truth.  I said I don\'t do sneaky things.  I don\'t leak.  I don\'t do weasel moves.  But I was not on anybody\'s side politically and could not be counted on in that traditional political sense, which I said I thought was in the president\'s best interest....\n\n> He replied that he needed loyalty and expected loyalty.  I did not reply, or even nod or change my facial expression, which he noted because we came back to it later.  \n\n-\n\n> At this point he asked me (and asked again later) whether "your guy McCabe" has a problem with me ... I explained that Andy was a true professional and had no problem at all. \n\n> [...]\n\n> At about this point he asked again about "your guy McCabe" and whether he was "going to be okay".  I again affirmed Andy\'s ability and professionalism and said the President would come to see and benefit from both.  \n\nThis is killer detail and really goes to show Trump had something very important on his mind.  Asking whether McCabe "is going to be okay" is super shady.  And notice the lengths Comey goes to to detail how Trump was objective-focused and totally controlling of the conversation, and was mindful to keep it totally out of earshot of the servers.\n\n> He then went on to explain that he has serious reservations about Mike Flynn\'s judgment and illustrated with a story from that day in which the President apparently discovered during his toast to Teresa May that █████████████ had called four days ago.  Apparently, as the President was toasting PM May, he was explaining that she had been the first to call him after his inauguration and Flynn interrupted to say that █████████████ had called (first, apparently).  It was then that the President learned of ████ call and he confronted Flynn about it (not clear whether that was in the moment or after the lunch with PM May).  Flynn said the return call was scheduled for Saturday, which prompted a heated reply from the President that six days was not an appropriate period of time to return a call from the  ███████████ of a country like  ███████("This isn\'t ████████ we are talking about).  He said that if he called ███████████████ and didn\'t get a return call for six days he would be very upset.  In telling the story, the President pointed his fingers at this head and said "the guy has serious judgement issues".  I did not comment at any point during this topic and there was no mention or acknowledgement of any FBI interest in or contact with General Flynn.  \n\nWow, Trump really didn\'t want Flynn to insult Russia.  I think this is what Trump meant when he said he was concerned with Flynn\'s "judgement issues".  And it seems like it\'s about Flynn\'s call with the ambassador.  If so, then Trump knew the same day it happened.\n\nFill in the blanks! \n\n* Kislyak\n* Kislyak\n* Kislyak\n* ambassador\n* Russia\n* Canada?\n* Putin\n\n*edit:* Adding on two more things, a *very strange* followup to Trump and Bill O\'Reilly\'s "Putin is a killer" exchange, and jailing reporters:\n\n> He then pivoted to the Russians wanting an apology from Bill O\'Reilly.  I said I had seen that and O\'Reilly\'s reply, which was to "call him in 2023."  The President said that O\'Reilly\'s question about whether he respected Putin had been a hard one ████████████████████████████████████████████████████████.  He said he does respect the leader of a major country and thought that was the best answer.  He then said, "You think my answer was good, right?"  I said the answer was fine, except the part about killers, because we aren\'t the kind of killers that Putin is.  **When I said this, the President paused noticeably.**  I don\'t know what to make of it, but he clearly noticed I had directly criticized him.  \n\nWhy does this need redacted, and why did Trump pause so noticeably?\n\nAnd two, from the Flynn memo:\n\n> I tried to interject several times to agree with him about the leaks being terrible, but was unsuccessful.  When he finished, I said I agreed very much that it was terrible that his calls with foreign leaders leaked.  I said they were classified and he needed to be able to speak to foreign leaders in confidence.  [NOTE: because this an unclassified document, I will be limited in how I describe what I said next].  I then explained why leaks purporting to be about FBI intelligence operations were also terrible and a serious violation of the law.  I explained that the FBI gathers intelligence in part to equip the President to make decisions, and if people run around telling the press what we do, that ability will be compromised.  I said I was eager to find leakers and would like to nail one to the door as a message.  I said something about it being difficult and **he replied that we need to go after the reporters, and referred to the fact that 10 or 15 years ago we put them in jail to find out what they know, and it worked**.  He mentioned Judy Miller by name.  I explained that I was a fan of pursuing leaks aggressively but that going after reporters was tricky, for legal reasons and because DOJ tends to approach it conservatively.  He replied by telling me to **talk to "Sessions"** and see what we can do about being more aggressive.  I told him I would speak to the Attorney General. \n\n> [...]\n\n> The President then wrapped up our conversation by returning to the issue of finding leakers.  I said something about the value of putting a head on a pike as a message.  **He replied by saying it may involve putting reporters in jail.  "They spend a couple days in jail, make a new friend, and they are ready to talk".** I laughed as I walked to the door Reince Priebus had opened. \n\n"make a new friend"?  People don\'t talk like this, especially as President to the FBI director, if they don\'t mean it.  Read this loud and clear for what it is, Trump supporters ^(who don\'t like authoritarian police states)'

'The part that isn’t getting enough attention is [here, at page 8] (https://www.scribd.com/document/376854120/2018-4-19-Comey-Memo-Enclosure-Unclassified#)\n\nOn February 8, Priebus asked Comey if Flynn was under a FISA warrant - ie if the FBI had probable cause to believe he was a knowing agent of a foreign power, and had convinced a judge to issue a warrant. It is [very hard to get such a warrant] (https://www.axios.com/what-is-fisa-and-how-does-it-work-nunes-page-f661867c-e8b0-4d72-8b65-8302ad33da29.html). \n\nThe answer was **[YES] (https://mobile.twitter.com/pwnallthethings/status/987153099491037184)**.\n\nLet that sink in. The National Security Advisor to the President of the United States was thought by US law enforcement - and the judge who approved the warrant - to probably be a spy. Presumably for Russia. \n\nAnd the Chief of Staff to the President knew this, yet didn’t fire the spy for a further five  days (Feb 8 to Feb 13).\n\nThe day after that firing, the President ushered his Chief of Staff out of the room and said to the Director of the FBI:\n\n>I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting [the spy] go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.\n\n*Edit* - for those saying “but suspecting Flynn of being an *agent of a foreign power* doesn’t mean he’s a suspected *spy*, that is *exactly* what that term means in this context. \n\n**“Agent of a foreign power”**as defined by [50 U.S. Code § 1801 (b)(2)] (https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1801)\n\n>any person who—\n\n>(A) **knowingly engages in clandestine intelligence gathering activities** for or on behalf of a foreign power, which activities involve or may involve a violation of the criminal statutes of the United States;\n\n>(B) pursuant to the direction of an intelligence service or network of a foreign power, **knowingly engages in any other clandestine intelligence activities** for or on behalf of such foreign power, which activities involve or are about to involve a violation of the criminal statutes of the United States;'

'My notes from reading the memos.  I\'m going to skip the tidbits that I think others have been covering enough already and focus on others that stood out to me.\n\nOn p. 3 of the 1/28/17, my boldface:\n\n> He said he thought maybe he should ask me to investigate the whole thing to prove it was a lie.  I did not ask any questions.  I replied that it was up to him, but I wouldn\'t want to create a narrative that we were investigating him, **because we are not** and I worried such a thing would be misconstrued.\n\nOn p. 3 of the 2/8/17, holy crap:\n\n> He then asked me if this was a "private conversation."  I replied that it was.  He then said he wanted to ask me a question and I could decide whether it was appropriate to answer.  He then asked, "Do you have a FISA order on Mike Flynn?"  I paused for a few seconds and then said that I would answer here, but that this illustrated the kind of question that had to be asked and answered through established channels.  I said the answer was ██████  I then explain that the normal channel was from DOJ leadership to the WH counsel about such things.\n\nAgain on p. 3 of the 2/8/17.  Comey talks about [Going Dark](https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/going-dark-are-technology-privacy-and-public-safety-on-a-collision-course), his pet initiative to prohibit private market encryption in the United States.  [Obama was well known to have no enthusiasm for it](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/obama-resists-calls-for-encryption-shift-216920), but it appears that we can now picture that Comey was meeting with Trump partly to sell it to him:\n\n> He said he understood and then asked me what I would talk to Denis McDonough about.  I said two kinds of things: policy, like Going Dark, and particular operational issues if we were facing a terror threat or there was an intelligence operation that was sensitive.\n\nEnd of p. 1, beginning of p.2 of the 2/14/17.  Am I reading this right, and Comey appears to have taken the deliberate decision to start writing these memos so they don\'t need to be classified?  This note:\n\n> [NOTE: because this is an unclassified document, I will be limited in how I describe what I said next.]\n\nOn p.2 of the 2/14/17:\n\n> I said I was eager to find leakers and would like to nail one to the door as a message.  I said something about it being difficult and he replied that we need to go after the reporters, and referred to the fact that 10 or 15 years ago we put them in jail to find out what they know, and it worked.  He mentioned Judy Miller by name.  I explained that I was a fan of pursuing leaks aggressively but that going after reporters was tricky, for legal reasons and because DOJ tends to approach it conservatively.  He replied by telling me to talk to "Sessions" and see what we can do about being more aggressive.  I told him I would speak to the Attorney General.\n\nOn p. 1 of the 3/30/17.  Trump himself has said on TV that he fired Comey because of the Russia thing, but I\'m struck by the following theme that keeps coming up in the memos, that Trump very much wanted Comey to make a public statement that the President was not under investigation.  This theme also appeared in Trump\'s letter firing Comey:\n\n> I reminded him that I had told him we weren\'t investigating him and that I had told the Congressional leadership the same thing.  He said it would be great if that could get out and serveral times asked me to find a way to get that out.\n\nOn the 4/10/17, the theme recurs yet again "He said that he was following up to see if I did what had asked last time—getting out that he personally is not under investigation."\n\n**EDIT:** Overall impressions: I think Comey comes across less virtuous in these memos than he paints himself in public statements, but by no means corrupt either.  For example in testimony he has talked at a lot of length about how distressed he was about getting so much one-on-one attention from the President, but I just don\'t see that theme in the notes, and I do see him eager to bring up Going Dark.  \n\nMy read of Trump in the very early memos does however match what Comey later testified, that Trump was trying to establish a patronage relationship.  I\'m reminded of [this Ezra Klein article from last year](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/8/15762642/comey-testimony-trump-hearing), which highlighted these bits from Comey\'s testimony to Congress.  This will be a long quote, but I think it\'s well worth it:\n\n> The consequences of Trump’s behavior, ironically, are most clearly seen in the parts of Comey’s testimony that the president’s defenders are touting. Take Comey’s exchange with Sen. Marco Rubio. Rubio asked about Trump’s request that Comey end the investigation into Michael Flynn. If that request was so offensive, Rubio demanded, why didn’t Comey respond more forcefully?\n> \n> > RUBIO: At the time, did you say something to the president about, that is not an appropriate request, or did you tell the White House counsel, it\'s not an appropriate request? Someone needs to tell the president he can\'t do these things.\n> > \n> > COMEY: I didn\'t, no.\n> > \n> > RUBIO: Why?\n> > \n> > COMEY: I don\'t know. I think — as I said earlier, I think the circumstances were such that it was — I was a bit stunned and didn\'t have the presence of mind. I don\'t know. I don\'t want to make you sound like I\'m captain courageous. I don\'t know if I would have said to the president with the presence of mind, “Sir, that\'s wrong.” In the moment, it didn\'t come to my mind. What came to my mind is, “Be careful what you say.” I said, “I agree, Flynn is a good guy.”\n>\n> Comey made a similar point under questioning by Sen. Dianne Feinstein:\n> \n> > FEINSTEIN: Now, here\'s the question, you\'re big. You\'re strong. I know the Oval Office, and I know what happens to people when they walk in. There is a certain amount of intimidation. But why didn\'t you stop and say, “Mr. President, this is wrong.” There is a certain amount of intimidation. But why didn\'t you stop and say, “Mr. President, this is wrong. I cannot discuss this with you.”\n> > \n> > COMEY: It\'s a great question. Maybe if I were stronger, I would have. I was so stunned by the conversation that I just took it in. The only thing I could think to say, because I was playing in my mind — because I could remember every word he said — I was playing in my mind, what should my response be? That\'s why I very carefully chose the words. Look, I\'ve seen the tweet about tapes. Lordy, I hope there are tapes. I remember saying, “I agree he is a good guy,” as a way of saying, I\'m not agreeing with what you asked me to do. Again, maybe other people would be stronger in that circumstance. That\'s how conducted myself. I hope I\'ll never have another opportunity. Maybe if I did it again, I would do it better.\n> \n> Republicans have taken this as important to Trump’s defense. The reasoning, as I understand it, is that if Trump’s request of Comey was so egregious, then how come Comey didn’t tell Trump it was so egregious, or quit on the spot? [...]\n> \n> Here is another way to understand this story. James Comey was the director of the FBI. He was elevated to that position precisely because he had proven himself unusually able to resist political intimidation. As director of the FBI, he had a 10-year term designed to grant him independence, he led an agency with a proud culture of resisting outside interference, and he was exposed, daily, to the most unnerving secrets and profound threats that face the country.\n> \n> In other words, Comey was, for reasons both of personality and position, one of the hardest civil servants to intimidate. But when trapped in a room with the president of the United States, and when his job and all the good he believed he could do in it was dangled before him, even he felt the pressure. To his credit, he didn’t crack. But he felt it, just as Trump knew he would.\n\nI\'m trying to organize my thoughts here, but I get the impression from the memos that what Klein\'s article describes is definitely going on, but Comey also left of his Senate testimony some bits and pieces that make him look less good.  Like, his giving an answer to the President about Flynn/FISA; his telling the President that "was eager to find leakers and would like to nail one to the door as a message"; his bringing up of his pet policy initiative (Going Dark); etc.\n\nI also think that I didn\'t give the "tell the public I\'m not under investigation" motif enough weight.'
'Why would Republicans think this was a good idea lmao.  This just makes Comey look even more credible.  '

'**Anderson Cooper**: For sitting here talking to me today you could be fined a million dollars I mean aren\'t you taking a big risk?\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: I am.\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: I guess I\'m not 100% sure on why you\'re doing this.\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: Because it was very important to me to be able to defend myself\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: Is part of talking w-- wanting to set the record straight?\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: 100%.\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: Why does the record need to be set straight?\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: Because people are just saying whatever they wanted to say about me, I was perfectly fine saying nothing at all, but I\'m not okay with being made out to be a liar, or people thinking that I did this for money and people are like, "Oh, you\'re an opportunist. You\'re taking advantage of this. Yes, I\'m getting more job offers now, but tell me one person who would turn down a job offer making more than they\'ve been making, doing the same thing that they\'ve always done?  \n\n**Anderson Cooper**: A lotta people are using you for a lotta different agendas.\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: They\'re trying to. Like, oh, you know, Stormy Daniels comes out #MeToo. This is not a \'Me Too.\' I was not a victim. I\'ve never said I was a victim. I think trying to use me to-- to further someone else\'s agenda, does horrible damage to people who are true victims. Stormy Daniels\' real name is Stephanie Clifford. She\'s 39 years old, from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and has been acting in, directing, and writing adult films for nearly 20 years. She was one of the most popular actresses in the adult industry when she was introduced to Mr. Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe in July, 2006. She says he invited her to dinner, and she met him at his hotel suite.\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: How was the conversation?\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: Ummm (LAUGH) it started off-- all about him just talking about himself. And he\'s like-- "Have you seen my new magazine?\n**Anderson Cooper**: He was showing you his own picture on the cover of a magazine.\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: Right, right. And so I was like, "Does this-- does this normally work for you?" And he looked very taken-- taken back, like, he didn\'t really understand what I was saying. Like, I was--  does, just, you know, talking about yourself normally work?" And I was like, "Someone should take that magazine and spank you with it." (LAUGH) And I\'ll never forget the look on his face. He was like--\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: What-- what was his look?\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: Just, I don\'t think anyone\'s ever spoken to him like that, especially, you know, a young woman who looked like me. And I said, you know, "Give me that," and I just remember him going, "You wouldn\'t." "Hand it over." And-- so he did, and I was like, turn around, drop \'em."\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: You-- you told Donald Trump to turn around and take off his pants.\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: Yes.\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: And did he?\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: Yes. So he turned around and pulled his pants down a little -- you know had underwear on and stuff and I just gave him a couple swats.\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: This was done in a joking manner.\n\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: Yes. and-- from that moment on, he was a completely different person.\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: How so?\n\n**Stormy Daniels**:  He quit talking about himself and he asked me things and I asked him things and it just became like more appropriate.\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: It became more comfortable.\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: Yeah. He was like, "Wow, you-- you are special. You remind me of my daughter." You know-- he was like, "You\'re smart and beautiful, and a woman to be reckoned with, and I like you. I like you."\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: At this point was he doing The Apprentice?\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: Yes. And he goes, "Got an idea, honeybunch. Would you ever consider going on and-- and being a contestant?" And I laughed and-- and said, "NBC\'s never gonna let, you know, an adult film star be on." It\'s, you know, he goes, "No, no," he goes, "That\'s why I want you. You\'re gonna shock a lotta people, you\'re smart and they won\'t know what to expect"\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: Did you think he was serious, or did you think he was kind of dangling to get you to wanna be involved him?\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: Both.\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: Melania Trump had recently given birth to-- to a son, just a few months before. Did that-- did he mention his wife or child at all in this?\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: I asked. And he brushed it aside, said, "Oh yeah, yeah, you know, don\'t worry about that. We don\'t even we have separate rooms and stuff."\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: Did you two go out for dinner that night?\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: No.\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: You had dinner in the room?\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: Yes.\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: What happened next?\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: I asked him if I could use his restroom and he said, "Yes, you know, it\'s through those-- through the bedroom, you\'ll see it." So I-- I excused myself and I went to the-- the restroom. You know, I was in there for a little bit and came out and he was sitting, you know, on the edge of the bed when I walked out, perched.\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: And when you saw that, what went through your mind?\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: I realized exactly what I\'d gotten myself into. And I was like, "Ugh, here we go." (LAUGH) And I just felt like maybe-- (LAUGH) it was sort of-- I had it coming for making a bad decision for going to someone\'s room alone and I just heard the voice in my head, "well, you put yourself in a bad situation and bad things happen, so you deserve this."\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: **And you had sex with him.**\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: **Yes.**\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: **You were 27, he was 60. Were you physically attracted to him?**\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: **No.**\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: **Not at all?**\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: **No.** HAHAH\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: Did you want to have sex with him?\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: No. But I didn\'t-- I didn\'t say no. I\'m not a victim, I\'m not--\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: It was entirely consensual.\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: Oh, yes, yes.\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: You work in an industry where condom use is-- is an issue. Did-- did he use a condom?\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: No.\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: Did you ask him to?\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: No. I honestly didn\'t say anything.\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: After you had sex, what happened?\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: He said that it was great, he had-- a great evening, and it was nothing like he expected, that I really surprised him, that a lotta people must underestimate me-- that he hoped that I would be willing to see him again and that we would discuss the things we had talked about earlier in the evening.\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: Being on The Apprentice.\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: Right.\n\nDaniels says she and Mr. Trump stayed in touch. She says he invited her to a Trump Vodka launch party in California, as well as to his office in Trump Tower in New York.\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: So he definitely wanted to continue to see you.\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: Oh, for sure. Yes.\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: And this was not a secret. He never asked me not to tell anyone he called several times when I was in front of many people and I would be like, "Oh my God, he\'s calling." They were like, "Shut up, the Donald?" And I\'d put him on speakerphone, and he wanted to know what I was up to and "When can we get together again? I just wanted to give you a quick update, we had a meeting, it went great. There\'s-- it\'s gonna be spectacular, they\'re totally into the idea," and I was like mhmm that part I never believed.\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: Did you still get the sense that he was kind of dangling it in front of you--\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: Oh, for sure, oh yeah.\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: To keep you interested, to keep you coming back.\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: Of course, of course. I mean, I\'m not blind. But at the same time, maybe it\'ll work out, you know?\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: Did you view it as this is a potential opportunity. "I\'m gonna see where it goes?"\n\n**Stormy Daniels**:  I thought of it as a business deal.\n\n---\n\nIn July 2007 -- a year after they met -- Daniels says Mr. Trump asked to meet with her privately at his bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles to discuss a development regarding her possible appearance on Celebrity Apprentice.\n\n----\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: I remember arriving, and he was watching Shark Week. He made me sit and watch an entire documentary about shark attacks.\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: It wasn\'t at that point a business meeting, it was just watching Shark Week.\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: Yeah.\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: Did you have sex with him again?\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: No.\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: Did he want to?\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: Yes.\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: How do you know he wanted to?\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: Because he came and sat next to me and, you know, touched my hair, and put his hand on my leg, and r-- referenced back to how great it was the last time.\n\n**Anderson Cooper**: How did you get out of it?\n\n**Stormy Daniels**: Well, I\'d been there for, like, four hours. And so I then was like, "Well, before, you know, can we talk about what\'s the development?" And he was like, "I\'m almost there. I\'ll have an answer for you next week." And I was like, "Okay, cool. Well-- I guess call me next week."

That\'s a lie?\n\n> Stormy Daniels: Yes.\n\n> Anderson Cooper:  If it was untruthful, why did you sign it?\n\n> Stormy Daniels: **Because they made it sound like I had no choice.**\n\n> Anderson Cooper: I mean, no one was putting a gun to your head?\n\n> Stormy Daniels: Not physical violence, no.\n\n> Anderson Cooper:  you thought that there would be some sort of legal repercussion if you didn\'t sign it?\n\n> Stormy Daniels: Correct.

People, you know, say, "You\'re gonna have to pay a lot of money when you lose this-- this case."\n\n> Michael Avenatti: People don\'t threaten people with $20 million lawsuits, that they\'re gonna take their home and take an extended vacation on the money they receive. **People don\'t conduct themselves like this.

But the fact of the matter is **Mr. Trump never signed the agreement.** He was obligated to sign the agreement in order for the agreement to spring into effect.\n\n> That\'s not true, according to Michael Cohen, who has said only his signature was required. What was also required under the non-disclosure agreement was for Stormy Daniels to turn over all "video images, still images, email messages, and text messages," she had regarding Mr. Trump.\n\n> Anderson Cooper: Did you do that?\n\n> Stormy Daniels: I can\'t answer that right now.\n\n> Anderson Cooper: You don\'t want to say one way or the other if you have text messages or other items?\n\n> Stormy Daniels: My attorney has recommended that I don\'t discuss those things.\n\n> Anderson Cooper: You seem to be saying that she has some sort of text message, or video, or-- or photographs.

'The sex part seems the least impactful politically.  The $130,000 payment and illegal campaign financing is the most interesting.\n\nOn the human side Melania is to be pitied, but honestly for the sake of the child Barron, she should make the exit to New York.  Why make this child witness the latest chapters of his morally repulsive father played out in the glare of the media?

"Hi. \n\nCan we please focus on the bald stated fact that she was made to sign non disclosure agreements under duress?

"Honestly, it’s looking like Russia’s about to move in on the Baltics and then the Western World. And Trump’s going to keep us on the sidelines. We may have to break down the White House gates while protesting because this is going to get very dark, very soon. We have to leave his supporters behind or drag them with us.\n\nEdit: To add to my point, NATO, including Obama, probably should have felt more obliged to intervene when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014. However, that may have caused a major international conflict leading to war (which in hindsight temporarily prevented mass bloodshed and possible nuclear war, but also empowered Russia to take further undercover actions against many countries, including us). So, instead we sanctioned the fuck out of Russia. But it’s looking like it wasn’t enough. Russia has compromised the U.S. government through an act of cyber warfare, and erased those sanctions. It looks like Trump will not enforce more sanctions as he’s most likely compromised, and has a track record of blocking major Russian sanctions passed by Congress. \n\nSo, this time around, NATO enforcing sanctions without the backing from the U.S. may not be enough, and may have to engage militarily. So, maybe we didn’t punish Russia enough last time and have enabled them to take more aggressive actions (taking over the U.S. government to reduce sanctions and rule out the U.S. as a military conflict), so that they can increase their presence in the Baltics. Trump, as the Commander in Chief, will surely enable Russia more. What's this I am hearing about the U.S. ready to boost military security cooperation with Russia?\n\nIn short, this time around, Russia needs a serious spanking. They’ve been influencing elections and corrupting governments around the world. They are becoming too much of a problem to the rest of the world and need to be put in their place. Without taking more serious actions as one of the most powerful countries in the world, we are letting this authoritarian trend rise throughout the world in levels not seen since, well you know...\n\nIn relation to the article posted, first thing is first. Get the Russian spy out of the Oval Office. It may literally save the World. This is a wake up call, Americans. Who we choose to lead this country carries vast consequences, for not only us, but for everyone on this planet. We should be extremely considerate in who elect as the leader of the free world in 2020, unlike in 2016. We, as U.S. citizens, have a heavy responsibility to alter the path of our future, to prevent authoritarianism, and to represent freedom. "

'They won’t impeach him to save the country but they would to save the party I bet. As Republican ratings keep dropping they may have to to avoid an election bloodbath.'
"We all grew up on stories that led us to believe that, in the end, good guys always win.  That justice always prevails.  That, even if there is sacrifice, we can save what needs saving in the end.\n\nMaybe such stories haven't adequately prepared our expectations for what is to come.  Maybe this is not a storm that America will be able to weather and come out the other side all the better.  We beat the Nazis in WW2, and ushered in an era of growing prosperity and progress.  Maybe that era is coming to an end.  If we all don't do something, don't let our voices be heard, don't do our damndest to be involved in this process as much as we can be, maybe America doesn't survive this one.  Maybe we lose."

"There will be no consequence for Trump as long as Republicans have the majority. \n\nIt's a typical psychology case. They know he is unfit for office, they know he is an idiot, but because of this, they think that they are the smart ones. They think that they can control him, use him for their advantage, even though he has proven again and again to be unstable and sometimes unpredictable. But to accept this, they have to accept their errors. As long as the Republicans hold the most power as long as their is the possibility of success, they will allow,defend and enable Trump. \n\nIt's a room full of dumb people, all thinking they are the smartest of them all.

"Can Reddit do us all a favor, in 20 years when you run for government office, please have your Reddit username on the ticket so the rest of this subreddit can be sure they vote for you.\n\nPeople need to get over their self-righteousness.

'Good luck with that since the GOP in Congress has the power here.'
'I’m not a big fan of the guy, but there’s a headline like this almost every week. Which is crazy if a lot of this is true. I just think saying this every time is getting a little out of control and is desensitizing everyone to him getting impeached. \n\nAND a lot of people were saying this about Obama. And I mean he gave the go ahead to drone strike a hospital or something. \n\nI get it he lied and maybe sold out to Putin, but there’s good evidence that Hillary rigged primaries and when that came out people still voted for her.\n\nIdk what point I’m making, but I just feel like there are many headlines like this and he’s not any closer to being impeached.

'One thing the Trump presidency proves is that that US political system needs a safety valve, a way to ensure that one party can not hold the country hostage.'
'Wow - and he was such a fan of the FBI this time last year.\n\nWhat happened?'
"People absolutely cannot let this man or his party stamp all over our long standing, respected institutions. These people do good work - something that can't be said about these opportunists, sycophants, and sociopaths."
'If anything, I have more respect for the FBI at this current moment than at any other time in my life. I always assumed they and the CIA were just manipulating the world for their own personal interests (and they do, mind you), but seeing them investigate this Trump case for the good of maintaining sanity in the American political system has made me open up to them a lot more. '
'I can\'t speak for the FBI, but I know some U.S. Marshals and I can tell you they were outspoken in their dislike for Obama.  One of them, now retired, was assigned to guard Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for awhile.  He said of her "She\'s a bitch".  Granted, he didn\'t publicly Tweet that, but it nonetheless shows that these men and women do have biases.  However, I don\'t think that bias significantly influences how they do their job.'
'I live in Britain. From where we stand, the reputation of the FBI is only getting better. To see an institution openly investigating without fear or favour is awesome. '
"He will convert the FBI to his own secret police. Trump needs a Stasi/KGB to control public opinion and eliminate dissidents. The GOP wouldn't object to having the de facto authority of a Politburo in addition to the fear of retribution that forces vote by consensus for whatever the leadership desires. Things could get dark quickly if Congress- who stand to gain immensely if the plan succeeds- supports his transformation of the FBI."
'Actually i have more faith restored in the FBI in the past few months than ever before '
'Earlier this week, [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/04/politics/mueller-special-counsel-investigation-russian-oligarchs/index.html) broke the story that Mueller had stopped several oligarchs asking questions about Russian money being funneled to the campaign or inauguration. That story indicates that Mueller and his team were focused on two methods to accomplish this:\n\n1. One area under scrutiny, sources say, is investments Russians made in companies or think tanks that have political action committees that donated to the campaign.\n\n2. Another theory Mueller\'s office is pursuing, sources said, is whether wealthy Russians used straw donors -- Americans with citizenship -- as a vessel through which they could pump money into the campaign and inauguration fund.\n\nPrevious stories from the Dallas Morning News have also raised questions about straw donors. One of these stories, ["How Putin\'s oligarchs funneled millions into GOP campaigns"](https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2017/12/15/putins-proxies-helped-funnel-millions-gop-campaigns), focused on several specific people:\n\n* Len Blavatnik, a dual U.S.-U.K. citizen and one of the largest donors to GOP political action committees in the 2015-16 election cycle. [...] Data from the Federal Election Commission show that Blavatnik\'s campaign contributions dating back to 2009-10 were fairly balanced across party lines and relatively modest for a billionaire. [...] In 2015-16, everything changed. Blavatnik\'s political contributions soared and made a hard right turn as he pumped $6.35 million into GOP political action committees, with millions of dollars going to top Republican leaders including Sens. Mitch McConnell, Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham.\n\n* Andrew Intrater, according to Mother Jones, is Vekselberg\'s cousin. He is also chief executive of Columbus Nova, Renova\'s U.S. investment arm located in New York. (FEC records list his employer as Renova US Management LLC.). Intrater had no significant history of political contributions prior to the 2016 elections. But in January 2017 he contributed $250,000 to Trump\'s Inaugural Committee. His six-figure gift bought him special access to a dinner billed as "an intimate policy discussion with select cabinet appointees," according to a brochure obtained by the Center for Public Integrity.\n\n* Alexander Shustorovich, chief executive of IMG Artists, attempted to give the Republican Party $250,000 in 2000 to support the George W. Bush presidential campaign, but his money was rejected because of his ties to the Russian government, according to Quartz. So why didn\'t the Trump team reject Shustorovich\'s $1 million check to Trump\'s Inaugural Committee?\n\n* Simon Kukes is an oil magnate who has something in common with Intrater. From 1998 to 2003, he worked for Vekselberg and Blavatnik as chief executive of TNK. Redacted CIA documents released in 2003 under the Freedom of Information Act said "TNK president Kukes said that he bribed local officials." The CIA confirmed the authenticity of the reports to The Guardian newspaper but would not comment further. In 2016, Kukes contributed a total of $283,000, much of it to the Trump Victory Fund. He had no significant donor history before last year\'s election.\n\nAnother name worth looking at is Timothy Kasbe, who was discussed in the Washington Post\'s story about [well-connected Russians who attended the Trump inauguration](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/amid-trumps-inaugural-festivities-members-of-russias-elite-anticipated-a-thaw-between-moscow-and-washington/2018/01/20/0d767f46-fb9f-11e7-ad8c-ecbb62019393_story.html?utm_term=.c352bf8495d1).\n\nPrior to donating $150,000.00 to the Trump inauguration, Kasbe had no prior history of political contributions/donations. Kasbe was also an executive at a Russian-based jean company at the time he made the donation. Kasbe then left the country to take a job in New Zealand shortly after the inauguration.\n\nWhy was he covered in the WaPo story? It\'s because he was the one who invited Alexey Repik, one of the wealthy Russians with rumored ties to the FSB who attended the inauguration. Kasbe told the WaPo that the Repiks were "family friends from California," while Repik said "they had met months earlier during a tour of Silicon Valley companies for Russian business executives that Kasbe helped host on behalf of a headhunting firm."\n\nRepik had access to some major players during his inauguration visit. He attended various events where he met President Trump, Mike Pence, Reince Priebus, Rex Tillerson, and Mike Pompeo, posting some of these encounters on a public Facebook post and discussing others with the WaPo. \n\nHow did Repik get access to these power players? Well, Kasbe\'s [inauguration donation](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/donald-trump-cabinet-dinner-233721) would have provided some access. However, it appears Kasbe told the [New Zealand Herald](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11981768) that the event where Repik met President Trump was unrelated to his inauguration tickets/donations.\n\nWho invited Repik to that event? According to Repik\'s own [Facebook post](https://i.imgur.com/5LdPitV.png), it was **Reince Priebus.**'
'Trump spends $60 million of his own money on campaign\n\nNRA donates $60 million to Trump\n\nRussia donates to NRA\n\nSeems pretty fucking clear '
'Yeah, if we could remove all corporate money from politics, that would be great'
'It seems the Russians told Trump "you\'re great!" And then they told him "we\'ll loan you money" and then they told him "be careful because there is sordid stuff about you out there - stay loyal to us and we\'ll keep it out of the news"'
'So many Russians at his inaugeration, I feel like there must have been a group of agents doing their impression of the guys outside the wedding in The Godfather. Hope they could spell those tricky russian names correctly.'

Putting aside the obvious lack of faith in humanity displayed, the numbers just don\'t justify that conclusion.\n\n\nFirst here\'s the RCP polling chart for Clinton vs Trump in 2016:\n\nhttps://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\n\nYou can narrow it down too.  Though Clinton was on the upswing in early October, notice how wide the gap gets shortly after the access Hollywood tape was released.  Then look how sharply it narrows right after the Comey letter on October 28.\n\n\nIt looks a lot like how 538 summed it up:  [people really did switch votes at the last minute.](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/voters-really-did-switch-to-trump-at-the-last-minute/)\n\nIt had been repeated throughout the season how it was essentially a negative campaign - if the focus was on Clinton, Trump would win.  If the focus was on Trump, Clinton would win.\n\n\nNot only that, but turnout among black voters was significantly lower than in the previous two election cycles.\n\nhttp://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/black-voter-turnout-fell-in-2016-even-as-a-record-number-of-americans-cast-ballots/\n\n\nA tape of Donald Trump, with his face and his voice, uttering the N-word would surely have motivated more minorities and others to come out and vote against him who otherwise would have stayed home.\n\n\nKeeping in mind that this election was decided by 70,000 votes across three states.  If such a tape were released in mid to late October, it would have widened the gap even more, and the "coming home" effect and the Comey letter boost would not have been enough for him to recover.\n'

'When I first read this headline I thought "why would Russia prop up North Korea?" Then I thought about it: it\'s actually much the same reason that China consistently props up North Korea. \n\nNorth Korea is a strategic asset to China for two key reasons: a) it keeps their neighbor weak by keeping the Korean peninsula politically divided and b) it keeps the hands of their key adversaries in the region tied. Japan, South Korea, and the United States can\'t focus their attention on China because they constantly get distracted by the Kims. \n\nSo what does any of this have to do with Russia? Well, Russia has territory pretty close to the Korean Peninsula, but as we all know, the Asian portion of Russia is pretty sparsely populated, and Russia\'s population and military nexus is thousands of miles away in Europe, so geographic proximity seems like an unlikely candidate. I think the real reason is that it keeps the United States preoccupied in East Asia, which gives it less of a free hand to interfere with Russia\'s key geopolitical turf in Eastern Europe. The more energy the US invests in North Korea (or the Middle East, for that matter), the less energy we can devote to doing things that threaten Russian national security, like expanding NATO into the Ukraine or Georgia. For that reason, it\'s in Russia\'s interests to prop up North Korea. '

'This farce of a presidency opened my eyes to several things, one of which being how voting for a presidential ticket isn\'t simply a vote for a president and vice president.

Well, now we have a president who seems incapable of making any good, ethical, reasonable decisions, which includes his choices for who should lead these essential departments and who should represent the United States when dealing with foreign leadership.  We also have a Republican-controlled Congress that refuses to engage in that whole "checks and balances" system, even when the president does things like allow a know-nothing family member without appropriate security clearance to handle delicate diplomatic missions.\n\nIn the past, I didn\'t pay attention to politics, because I figured that regardless of political affiliation, the people who were elected were at least doing what they thought made sense.  Surely they wouldn\'t work to damage or destroy our country, right?  That clearly isn\'t the case, now.  I\'m not going to make that mistake again.'

'Hey guys, I\'m from British Columbia, Canada.\n\nI think I speak for everyone north of the border when I say we implore you to get angrier about that clown as every day passes by. At his core he is a scared, insecure, dilluted child. I know I\'m preaching to the choir, but if you lined up the intellectual giants of human history and polled them on what are the best ways to treat information you genuinely do not understand or know, they would most likely categorically tell you that the first step is admitting your ignorance and proceeding from there. Granted many men and women of genius have had flawed personalities (Newton, Plato, Pythagoras, Beethoven, to name only a few) but despite them they still advanced knowledge and understanding, they didn\'t spit in the face of thousands of years of accumulated human wisdom, they tried to build on top of the pile. Great human beings try to add on to the pile of knowledge, discuss it, and learn from it. People who have claimed to figure it all out and have all the answers are of the opposite variety.\n\nAMERICANS, your nation used to be a beacon for a pretty cool ideal, or ideals. Currently your nation, sorry to say, is looked at as a joke everywhere else, save for a few locals. The people on your side these days are staggeringly bankrupt ethically and if we all used their strategies for existing with one another, everyone would be dead. Trump and those like him have a strategy for manoeuvering through life that, if scaled up so that everyone used it, would ensure the collapse of civilization. This isn\'t postulating, if you follow the logical thread to the very end men like trump and their strategies for survival and success are toxic on the largest scales. The only reason he and some others can do it and get away with it is precisely because only a certain proportion of the population can use this strategy and have it be viable. There is a fish called \'the oscillated wrasse\', if you look into the behaviour of the "sneaker male" you will see what I mean. \n\nPlease oh please USA, start giving a shit about experts, about the history of our planet, about knowledge, and about the philosophy of what it means to be a leader in a country that is supposed to encapsulate ideals of justice, equality, reason, progress, and inteligence, among other things. Your country, and mine, would do well to start discussing these concepts like the ancient philosophers did. We need to find out what "justice" is and should be, not quabble over throwing drug dealers in jail. If anyone has missed it, we still don\'t all agree on what justice is, what fairness is, what a government should be, we all pretend like the answers to those questions and questions like it have been solved, the reality is we just assume that they are solved, they require constant attention and adjustment especially in a fluctuating world. One of the great human tragedies is that so many of us subscribe to a specific religion, philosophy, or story that we have told ourself about the world. The tragedy is that it isn\'t any one particualr viewpoint, it\'s all of them and none of them. Everything has a nugget of wisdom to offer, the lack of information synthesis into personalized thought is exactly what your president represents. He symbolizes terrible learning skills and excellent obedience to biases. \nThe great humans of the past would, I think, be ashamed to claim Trump and people like him to the human race. We are all still profoundly ignorant of so many things yet we aren\'t aware of this fact collectively. If we move towards the mentality of the great thinkers I think most people would be far better off. \n\nNow if your nation could please get back behind the wheel and right the ship before more assholes with barely viable thinking and survival strategies take the helm for too long and reduce Earth to either a pile of ashes, or, a dystopic future where the pursuit of transitory pleasures has really taken over completely and we\'re all slaves to whatever we have become addicted to.\n\nCheers, I\'m pulling for you,\n\nA friend '
'A reality TV Star is President. \n\nWhy not have a purse designer as Secretary of State?\n\nAmerica...formerly the land of the free and the proud. '
'Only the best and most qualified people! It’s funny how r/conservative rationalizes how Trump fires people like mad by saying that he only wants people who are the best at the job and then this shit happens. I wonder how they will bend their reality to justify it.'
'I just love that a wholly unqualified purse designer is now secretary of state. Starting to get tired of all this winning. '
'Remember when the reports came out that John Kelly wanted Ivanka AND Jared out because they have no security clearance?\n\nReally doing a good job there General! Those two are basically co-Secretary of States now! And as bad as this sounds I really, REALLY hope other countries are taking advantage of this. We certainly are asking for it because of these idiots.'
'I appreciate that flake is taking any stand what-so ever. However, he seems to be taking no action what-so ever. I am not saying he has to disregard his political beliefs, but his sits on the judiciary committee and could hold up all nominees until Trump apologizes or agrees to daca or something substantial that results in meaningful action.  '
"Flake is playing a long game. Hoping to be the Conservative beacon once this house of bigoted cards comes crashing down. And he's not wrong. He might even have the convictions he espouses. But this speech is a calculated move to further cement Flake as the voice of the moderate centrist opposition. "

'I\'m not advocating any position here, I\'m legitimately asking: *why* would Trump even say that?

There are many forms of payment, I didn’t say how.\n\nWSJ: Could you give us an example?\n\nMr. Trump: They can pay for it through, as an example, they can pay for it indirectly through Nafta. OK? You know, we make a good deal on Nafta, say I’m going to take a small percentage of that money and it’s going to go toward the wall. Guess what? Mexico’s paying. Now Mexico may not want to make the Nafta deal and which is OK, then I’ll terminate Nafta…which I think would be frankly a positive for our country. I don’t think it’s a positive for Mexico, I don’t think it’s a positive for the world. But it’s a positive for our country because I’d make a much better deal. There is no deal that I can make on Nafta that’s as good as if I terminate Nafta and make a new deal. OK? But I feel that we have a chance of making a reasonable deal, the way it is now."\n\nSo once again, Trump thinks that trade deficit is bank account some how owned by Mexico, and he thinks he can bill the wall by...renegotiating NAFTA?'

'I’m not even gay, but Mueller gives me a hard on every time I hear his name\n\nEdit: thanks for the gold good person of Reddit. Hope you have a great day! '
'So, what is the intent behind getting this story in the press? Someone (possibly the same person) was the source of the subpoena to both Axios & NBC News today; so clearly they wanted the existence of the subpoena reported on... but what would that person have to gain from this becoming public knowledge?\n\nI’m going to assume it wasn’t Mueller’s team - as we’ve seen from prior indictments, their team can keep a secret, and I think grand jury business can’t be talked about by any parties *except* those subpoenaed/testifying. And Mueller doesn’t need to flex - it’s abundantly clear that he’s serious especially about lying to the DOJ/FBI from his actions so far, so the idea that making the subpoena public would put additional pressure on those subpoenaed doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.\n\nSo, that leaves someone who was a part of Trump’s inner circle (and may still continue to be) wanting this information public. Are they trying to warn everyone that all their communications they turn over better match up with each other’s? Perhaps this is a plea for Trump/GOP to intervene and again”DO SOMETHING” to impede/undermine the special counsel? Or is this some form of public revenge from jilted ex-Trump staff that want to enjoy putting the Trump admin in further chaos and panic?'
'My uninformed opinion of the date is that it is sometime around a significant event. Perhaps when a Russian intelligence operation was launched? We know that by April 2016, Mifsud told Papadopolous that Russia had the emails. Mueller has broad subpoena power, but Rosenstein and the Justice Department are his check, so the date would have to be rationally related to something, not a phishing expedition. Ahh, I hope some more shoes drop.'

"Will Russia 'attacking' our election consist of them pointing out unsavory truths regarding the hypocrisy of the Democratic party?\n\nWould Russia be able to manipulate the US if the two main political parties weren't so inept and mistrusted by the general populace in the first place?\n\nYou'd think the continued electoral interference on the part of foreign powers would galvanize those grassroots types to maybe clean house so people are a little less susceptible to blatant Russian propaganda."

'Sounds like a good reason to enact voter ID laws.'
"I think it's more likely for the Russians to sabotage our elections by working for the democrats this time, at least for some of them. That way, the Republicans can cry about losing their majority due to foreign influence and claim any bill democrats try to pass as invalid. Imagine the people that voted for Trump, armed with the knowledge of democrats being aided, even if unknowingly, by Russians. There would be chaos in cities throughout the country. Sure, the Russians will still want Trump in office, but they're going to attack the House and Senate this time. All it'll take is one democratic candidate of the house in a traditionally Red district giving in to help from 'someone'  to win. The Trump base will take that and run with it, claiming it's all democrats. We need to make sure candidates with high morals win every primary.\n\nEdit: Tinfoil hat is off now"

'Trump is very much in a corner. Cancel the meeting and Putin puts the squeeze on. Keep the meeting without coming out against Putin and whatever small bit of obfuscation the GOP in Congress can pull off becomes untenable.\n\nMy bet is one of two outcomes:\n\n1. He\'s come out of the meeting scolding Putin with no meaningful follow up or making excuses for him to buy himself more time.\n2. Putin puts some very bad ideas in his head to embolden him to fire Mueller, Rosenstein, or otherwise do something bad. Worryingly, the appointment and confirmation in the Senate this week of Benczkowski to head the DOJ criminal division, former Alfa Bank lawyer with no prosecutorial experience makes me think this is the most likely next step for Trump. I\'d be interested to know the timeline between Rosenstein briefing Trump and Benczkowski\'s nomination, which puts him in line to succeed Rosenstein.\n\nI really hope it\'s not #2. Former CIA/NSA Dir. Hayden just told Jake Tapper he expects the next round of indictments to include Americans. Based on what we see in the indictments today, that\'s almost a given. Mueller and Rosenstein just made it impossible to justify their removal by Congress, but who knows with Trump.\n\nI would expect things are going to accelerate here. Hopefully in a good way, but who knows what Trump will do.\n\n"Therefore, the art of war lies in: never face a high mountain, never retreat from a down hill, never follow an enemy army faking defeat, never attack an elite enemy army, never bite a shark-bait, never chase after a retreating enemy army, **leave opening for a surrounded enemy army, never pressure a desperate enemy** **army**. This is the art of war." *The Art of War* by Sun Tzu, Chapter Army Conflict\n\nIt sure feels like the Trump-Putin summit is the opening for Mueller, Congress, and America to see how Trump tries to escape.'
"Trump was already informed about this earlier this week as per Rosenstein. Yet he still said the meeting with Putin would be the easiest one and 'yeah yeah, I'll bring up Russian hacking in the meeting..' (paraphrasing)."

'> Iran can now rid itself of all but the most basic nuclear inspections. As a member of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty Iran is required to accept a basic level of nuclear inspections. However, Iran had been under 24 hour, seven day a week surveillance at key sites, had hundreds of inspectors at its facilities and was prohibited from expanding its uranium enrichment work beyond 5,060 enrichment machines known as centrifuges, having any uranium enriched beyond 3.67% (to make a bomb over 90% enrichment levels are needed), or possessing any more than 300 kilograms of uranium for 15 years (far less than needed for even one bomb). Iran can now, at any time and without any notification to the world, can now possess as many centrifuges, as much uranium at as high an enrichment level as it choose. This could put it weeks away from building a nuclear weapon.\n\n\nAnd Trump says this is in the name of national security. What a joke. '

This resolution remains the binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute about the Iranian nuclear programme. We urge all sides to remain committed to its full implementation and to act in a spirit of responsibility.\n\n>**According to the IAEA, Iran continues to abide by the restrictions set out by the JCPoA, in line with its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The world is a safer place as a result. Therefore we, the E3, will remain parties to the JCPoA.** Our governments remain committed to ensuring the agreement is upheld, and will work with all the remaining parties to the deal to ensure this remains the case including through ensuring the continuing economic benefits to the Iranian people that are linked to the agreement.\n\n>**We urge the US** to ensure that the structures of the JCPoA can remain intact, and t**o avoid taking action which obstructs its full implementation by all other parties to the deal**. After engaging with the US Administration in a thorough manner over the past months, we call on the US to do everything possible to preserve the gains for nuclear non-proliferation brought about by the JCPoA, by allowing for a continued enforcement of its main elements.\n\n>**We encourage Iran to show restraint in response to the decision by the US; Iran must continue to meet its own obligations under the deal, cooperating fully and in a timely manner with IAEA inspection requirements.** The IAEA must be able to continue to carry out its long-term verification and monitoring programme without restriction or hindrance. In turn, Iran should continue to receive the sanctions relief it is entitled to whilst it remains in compliance with the terms of the deal.\n\nTranslation: our strongest allies rebuke Combover Caligula, tell him not to sabotage the agreement, note that Iran is meeting its obligations under the agreement, and urge Iran to ignore the stupid belligerence of the toddler purporting to be POTUS.\n'

"Just a reminder of what they US has been giving to Iran under this deal: absolutely nothing. Iran agreed to limit its use of uranium for nuclear energy, and to cease all efforts to develop nuclear weapons, as well as significantly reduce there facilities capable of enriching uranium. In exchange, all we agreed to do was not impose any new sanction, and we didn't even completely follow through with that. So it was pretty much an entirely one-sided agreement in which they made all of the concessions.  \n\nWhat does it mean that Trump is backing out of it? Its essentially him giving them permission to develop nuclear weapons. All that it means for us is that can if we chose impose new sanctions. But he has not mentioned any new sanctions, he is simply talking about it as if we are going to stop giving them things. But we aren't giving them anything. The fact that he hasn't mentioned any new sanctions is what leads me to believe that if he has any motivation for this other than giving the finger to Obama, it is because he or the foreign powers telling him what to do want Iran to have nuclear weapons.  Even if we imposed new sanctions, they don't have any effect if we are the only ones imposing them, they will just deal with China or Russia instead. All any new sanctions would do is give them closer relations to and make them more under the thumb of or biggest rivals on the international stage."

Obviously the Paris attackers *would* have been taken out by armed civilians because they were assuming the populace was unarmed, but how Trump plans on *silently* arming the French civilians without alerting the terrorists is beyond me. On the other hand, arming civilians makes it a million (or probably more than a billion) times easier for the average person to go on a shooting spree.'

'From our reporting:\n\n>Texas Democrat Beto O\'Rourke, who is challenging Sen. Ted Cruz, said Tuesday that President Donald Trump\'s performance at a summit with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin merits impeachment.  \n>  \n>And he blasted Cruz for failing to denounce Trump, who shocked U.S. intelligence and law enforcement by taking the former KGB spy chief\'s word that Russia did not meddle in the 2016 election.  \n>  \n>Last week, the Justice Department issued indictments against a dozen Russian military intelligence officers for doing just that.  \n>  \n>"Standing on stage in another country with the leader of another country who wants to and has sought to undermine this country, and to side with him over the United States - if I were asked to vote on this I would vote to impeach the president," O\'Rourke, a three-term congressman from El Paso, said in response a question from The Dallas Morning News. "Impeachment, much like an indictment, shows that there is enough there for the case to proceed and at this point there is certainly enough there for the case to proceed."\n\n**Edit:** We\'ve updated the article, headline and added comment from Sen. Ted Cruz who has called O\'Rourke a "partisan extremist."'
'Beto is who Texas needs as a senator. I love this guy more and more.'
"Ted Cruz had a weak response. It's great to see true patriots like Beto stand up for American Values."
'Just remember, people: None of this momentum matters if we don’t all get out and vote.

"This is now a midterm issue. I truly believe a bipartisan deal could be made with Pence (I know how crazy he is in religion but he isn't insane.) to make a moderate pick for Supreme Court if the Cabinet deems him unfit.

'Beto is currently in the middle of a campaign himself, he’s trying to gain some attention. I’m from El Paso and he doesn’t even have full support here. He’s banking on the Mexican vote all around Texas. \n\nEdit: all I meant to say is why tf are we acting like Beto is an authority in this situation, he’s calling for impeachment? He just wanted in on the convo to remind everyone he is anti-trump.'
"Beto O'Rourke lost the Senate race today. You don't call for impeachment of a Republican president in a red state of Bush, Clemens, Perry, Jerry Jones.\n\nThere is no way that the sports teams in TX--Jerry Jones, Jim Crane, etc. will allow Trump to be impeached.

"This is rather misleading.  This isn't related to Trump's personal income tax, it refers to his businesses.  I mean he does benefit indirectly being the owner of a business but so does everyone that has ownership in a business.  If you own stock (like have a 401K), you benefit as well.  The corporate tax rate was cut by 40%.  This is the reason why you see companies like ATT, Wells Fargo, Comcast, Boeing, etc are paying out bonuses.  Wells Fargo and Fifth Third Bank are also raising the wages of their employees.  So far, that's close to 800K people directly affected.  And this is just in the first 24 hours of the bill passing.  It hasn't even been signed into law yet.  I expect more companies to be doing the same.\n\nThis is actually good news.  These are real, average Americans that are seeing a bump in pay, not just rich fat cats.  I seriously cannot understand why people are so angry over this.  How can you be mad at someone getting a Christmas bonus or an increase in pay?  That's just cold."
'Ah, the good old "I don\'t care that it will save everyone money, I don\'t want Trump to benefit".'
"It's a progressive tax system where the rich pay more in taxes, so it makes sense that with tax cuts, the rich will get back a larger sum. \n\nLet's say I make 50k and my tax rate is 25%, I pay $12500/yr in taxes. Let's say a rich guy makes $1bil/yr and he pays 35% in taxes, he pays $350mil in taxes.\n\nLet's say we both get a 5% cut on out taxes, I get $2500 back and the rich man gets 50,000,000 back."

'Spoken like an honest man who would never be bribed by foreign businesses... right ?'
"I think it's worth taking a break from the nightmare/joke of having elected Trump to appreciate that the US once upon a time actually passed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\nI think it is unique among countries to place legal limits on ones own citizens corrupting other countries' government officials.\n\nIt is a much more complex issue than what is good or bad behavior alone. There is a sense that Trump's is at least parroting someone who thought they were making a cogent argument about how Americans were being out-competed by other countries' businessmen.\n\nOf course the even more sophisticated social sciences perspective though acknowledges that ultimately the means are the end, and that our history of international relations often greatly influenced by fallout from our attempts to be pragmatic in the past, and in a sense we exist in the world with norms that we help create.\n\nGiven all of that, and that it means this law was strategically justified in addition to being ideologically consistent with how we saw ourselves through most of our history up until the end of 2016, it is amazing to consider all of the cynical interests that were successfully overcome.\n\nThe mere existence of the law is a reason to be optimistic about the possibility of a government reemerging that is at least occasionally interested in ethical behavior."
"Thats how trump is used to doing business, behind closed doors with lots and lots of bribe money,\n\n I would bet he thinks it's ok for Casinos to launder money for the mob, just like he does, Or possibly take bribes from foreign nations, again just like he does, welcome to the new normal, where bribes are encouraged and money laundering is all the rage."
"When are people going to realize we don't need anymore dirt on Trump.  I mean sure, go ahead pile it on, but we already have enough to convict him for 300 years worth of corruption and crimes.

'>In Ronald Reagan’s second term, we ducked a bullet. I’ve always suspected he was propped up by a lot of people who a) didn’t trust vice-president George H.W. Bush, b) found it convenient to have a forgetful president when the subpoenas began to fly, and c) found it helpful to have a “detached” president when they started running their own agendas – like, say, selling missiles to mullahs. *You’re seeing much the same thing with the congressional Republicans. They’re operating an ongoing smash-and-grab on all the policy wishes they’ve fondly cultivated since 1981. Having a president who may not be all there and, as such, is susceptible to flattery because it reassures him that he actually is makes the heist that much easier.*'
'I said this during the election, and got loads of concern trolls saying you can\'t make a diagnosis without seeing them face to face. Except you obviously fucking can, TV and film have relied on this when portraying exactly that, and I\'ve seen it enough in real life to know dementia when I see it.\n\nThis author however has put my reasoning more succinctly than me: it\'s the classic coping mechanisms he uses that really give it away. His repetitions of key phrases, like verbal crutches. He\'ll use adjectives like "tremendous" over and over, repeating sentences with just a small change each time. [Every unprepared speech or interview](https://qz.com/623640/i-love-the-poorly-educated-read-donald-trumps-full-nevada-victory-speech/) it\'s \n\n>He loves the rifle stuff. This is serious rifle. This is serious NRA, both of them, both of them. We love the Second Amendment folks. Nobody loves it more than us, so just remember that.\n\nThat\'s dementia. Pulling each sentence out from the last. Hanging on keywords. Rifle rifle, serious serious, love love, etc. \n\nHe is incapable of saying that he x\'s something, without saying "nobody x\'s something like me". It\'s a crutch, he\'s steadying his speech looking for something coherent because his mind can\'t quite reach for what he meant to say.\n\nIt sounds sick but I\'ve actually been excited to see myself being proven right. I figured in 4 years I\'ll definitely get my "I told you so". I don\'t think we\'re quite at undeniable yet, but we\'re surely not far off some jaw dropping episode that leaves nobody in doubt. '
"I typically like to post the DSM criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder as it's more or less a TL;DR or Trump's presidential campaign.

'James Madison and Thomas Jefferson both warned that massive concentrations of wealth and privilege in American society posed a greater threat to democracy and the values of republicanism than any hostile element ever could. They saw extreme disparity in wealth as fundamentally corrupting and something that undermines and destroys civic virtue. Tocqueville also observes in "Democracy in America" that the American system only worked because of the relatively high degree of equal economic opportunity and a political culture that saw the accumulation of massive wealth as non-virtuous. Madison also advised that under those circumstances, it was the job of those who truly love their country and who embody civic virtue to preserve democracy by any possible means. I also can\'t help but be reminded of the Abraham Lincoln quote that says, "Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration."'
"I know I'll get downvoted, but aside from a small increase in my paycheck, my wife and I paid 3k this year in taxes, but next year we will be receiving $2,800 back in refunds, if we file exactly the same (and this is before getting a house and being able to utilize deductions).\n\nObviously the banks, rich, and corporations always reap most of the benefits of these laws, but that doesn't mean that for the middle class there are not benefits either. "
'I got a pretty big bonus :)'
"I’m not shocked at how many people on this subreddit actually believe that “trickle down” is a legitimately held theory, when in reality, it’s a strawman that has existed since the Roosevelt administration.\n\nFirst, In regards to increased income disparities since the mid 1970s, there are two out of a multitude of factors responsible for perpetuating the phenomenon that standout: less volatile and relatively poor labor productivity growth rates and changing family structure. Namely, an increase in single parenthood households.  It is to be expected that labor productivity continues to grow as technology continues to advance and people continue to accumulate capital. However, the important factor to look at is the growth rate of labor productivity. Labor productivity growth has certainly become less volatile and has been relatively lower since the mid to late 1970s. This isn’t my own wacky theory, rather is empirically proven fact by mainstream economists. Labor productivity growth has grown at a slower rate over the past 40 Years and wages reflect it https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/PRS85006092 (Change “from” to 1947 and you’ll see).\n\nLess volatile and relatively poor labor productivity growth doesn’t necessarily mean that individual workers are becoming increasingly “lazy”, rather it may suggests that the amount of capital per worker may not be sufficient. Which can be attributed to, again, a a multitude of factors such as relatively high corporate tax rates, decreased saving rates resulting in lower accumulation of capital, etc. It would be silly to suggest as if businesses are intentionally making their labor less productive as this would, if anything, jeopardize profit maximization. Either way, this large contributing factor has hardly anything to do with “corporate greed” or “too free of markets” at all. \n\nSecond, in regards to “trickle down” economics, it is a straw man argument dating back to the FDR administration. the term originates from FDR’s speech writer Samuel Rosenman. He said “the philosophy that had prevailed in Washington since 1921, that the object of government was to provide prosperity for those who lived and worked at the top of the economic pyramid, in the belief that prosperity would trickle down to the bottom of the heap and benefit all”. What Samuel Rosenman was referring to with his “since 1921” was the tax reductions advocated by Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Melon.  It has since been used as caricature representation of legitimate arguments and as a way to dismiss all legitimate public discourse about this complex issue. Despite the fact that no legitimate economist who advocates tax cuts does so solely out of believing wealth will just “trickle down” to the poor. The actual premise is that lower tax rates make it more profitable for investors to get high returns by investing outside of tax shelters. Now that this is actually taxable income, government revenues remain stable or even increase, while growth isn’t stifled by too high of tax rates on workers and businesses. \n\nThis has been observable multiple times in US history. In 1921, for example, marginal tax rates on people making over 100,000 annually was 73% and government collected roughly 700 million in income taxes. 30% of which was paid by those making over 100,000. By 1929, the marginal tax rate was cut to 24% on those making over 100,000 and the federal government now collected more than 1 billion in income taxes. But now 65% of which was collected from those making over 100,000.\nAnother example comes from increasing war-time income tax rates during the Wilson presidency. In 1916, the amount of people reporting taxable incomes of over 300,000 declined from more than 1,000 people to fewer than 300 by 1921. During those years, the amount of taxable income earned by those making more than 300,000 fell by over 4/5ths.\n\nNow, if Trump were consistent with neoclassical economic theory, he wouldn't have lowered taxes and increased spending at the same time. Neoclassical theory teaches that deficits negatively affect the savings rate. Which has a long run negative effect on labor productivity and ultimately, income. Keynesian theory teaches that a tax cut or spending increase will result in a short run rightward shift in rGDP. But this only affects price level in the long run. His behavior doesn't follow that either. "

'I am so sick of seeing articles like this as it is a total distraction from the actual tax benefits the lower to middle income households will be receiving. Posted this in r/politics before and got downvoted to hell because you honestly want to believe that the tax bill is bad, but here goes again any way.\n\nAs tax accountant who is just rounding up the 2017 tax season I feel more qualified than most to comment on this. Our tax software has a planner that calculates what your tax liability will look like in 2018 assuming all the numbers stay consistent to your 2017 return. After completing around 300+ 1040 returns this tax season, I have counted maybe 5-10 returns that will owe more. Pretty much across the board the typical tax payer will be seeing about $3000-$12,000 reduction in tax liability in 2018 depending on their income. In fact, lower income clients seemed to be seeing the most consistent savings out of our client base. Ironically, the clients most negatively affected by the bill were high income ($250,000+) W-2 employees who claim multiple dependents and had high itemized deductions, which is a small niche of taxpayers.\n\nYes big corporations are seeing tax savings as well but if you simply choose to ignore the tax savings the lower class are receiving because articles like this that are designed to manipulate you into thinking this way then you are flat out ignorant. Yes, lower income families may only receive a reduction of around $3000 in tax liability which may seem like crumbs, but think how much more valuable that is to them, and they had to do absolutely nothing to get it. On top of the fact that you have to put money in to get money back, so obviously lower income families tax benefits are smaller as they already pay the lowest amount of taxes. Not to mention that a majority EIC claimers in the US already get more back than they put in. \n\nAnother thing nobody wants to touch on is how this bill affects small business. Working for a small business myself I saw my biggest bonus ever at the end of tax season ever. Now this is going to vary from business owner to business owner, however I happen to have an amazing boss and obviously not everyone does. But regardless, do I even really have to defend why it is good for small business to receive tax savings?'

"I've never understood this argument of trickle down. I mean it seems so obviously false. Give a bunch of money to already wealthy people and they will decide whether or not to pass it along to those they employ - because a business decides on who to hire based on what they have in the bank and not based on business needs. But giving money directly to those that need it most, thus strengthening the economy immediately? Nah, that's socialism, can't have that. "

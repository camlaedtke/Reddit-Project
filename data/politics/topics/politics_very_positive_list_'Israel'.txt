'So this guy will bring peace to the Middle East? Sure, why not.'
'But but but he was only doing it so he could bring peace to the M.E! '
'Remember when Hilary couldn’t be trusted in the White House because she had a private email server?  How she couldn’t be trusted with our nation’s secrets?'
'"And in an email forwarded by the White House, the president said on Friday that he still relied on Mr. Kushner. “Jared is working very hard on peace between Israel and the Palestinians, and the last thing I would ever do is get in the way of that possibility,” Mr. Trump said."\n\nSupporting illegal Israeli settlements and working REALLY hard on peace. Lol, this fucking administration makes me laugh. '
'Where is the bottom of the pit that is holding all of the shit Kushner forgot to disclose? \n\nHOW are we still finding out about these things? '
'This has to stop. Kushner has repeatedly hidden things from his security clearance application that is clearly the exact situations the clearance was created to reveal.\n\nIf he can still get his clearance then we may as well throw it out because then it has clearly demonstrated that it no longer matters'
'The perfect choice to work on peace in the middle east. /s'
'This is a perfect symbol of the Trump administration.  Nepotism wrapped in conflict of interest wrapped in up-is-down left-is-right black-is-white opposite world appointments to important issues.'
"Good heavens is there anything this young man *didn't* fail to disclose?!"

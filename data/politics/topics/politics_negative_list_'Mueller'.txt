'No way.\n\nHe actually attempted it. \n\n>Around the time Mr. Trump wanted to fire Mr. Mueller, the president’s legal team, led then by his longtime personal lawyer in New York, Marc E. Kasowitz, was taking an adversarial approach to the Russia investigation. The president’s lawyers were digging into potential conflict-of-interest issues for Mr. Mueller and his team, according to current and former White House officials, and news media reports revealed that several of Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors had donated to Democrats.\n\n>Mr. Mueller could not legally have considered political affiliations when making hiring decisions.

We follow the rule of law, which means that we follow procedures and we reserve judgement. We complete our investigations and we evaluate all of the relevant evidence, before we reach any conclusion. That\'s how the American people expect their Department of Justice to operate and that is how our department is going to operate. In our justice system, everyone who is charged with a crime, is presume innocent, less and until proven guilty.

Because it creates the false expectation that this is an investigation into Trump\'s overall impeachability, that it remains an open question, and hence provides cover to politicians who are taking a feckless "wait and see" attitude. \n\nWe must Impeach Trump now, because of several dozen different things he\'s already done that are impeachable and his gross unfitness of character that is now privately obvious even to his most stalwart supporters.

'This section of the article features a nice reminder of what the dossier alleges occurred during the Prague meeting.\n\n> The dossier alleges that Cohen, two Russians and several Eastern European hackers met at the Prague office of a Russian government-backed social and cultural organization, Rossotrudnichestvo. The location was selected to provide an alternative explanation in case the rendezvous was exposed, according to Steele’s Kremlin sources, cultivated during 20 years of spying on Russia. It said that Oleg Solodukhin, the deputy chief of Rossotrudnichestvo’s operation in the Czech Republic, attended the meeting, too.\n\n> Further, it alleges that Cohen, Kosachev and other attendees discussed “how deniable cash payments were to be made to hackers in Europe who had worked under Kremlin direction against the Clinton campaign.”\n\n> U.S. intelligence agencies and cyber experts say Kremlin-backed hackers pirated copies of thousands of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chief John Podesta during 2015 and 2016, some politically damaging, including messages showing that the DNC was biased toward Clinton in the party’s nomination battle pitting her against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Mueller’s investigators have sought to learn who passed the emails to WikiLeaks, a London-based transparency group, which published them in July and October, causing embarrassment to Clinton and her backers.\n\n> Citing information from an unnamed “Kremlin insider,” Steele’s dossier says the Prague meeting agenda also included discussion “in cryptic language for security reasons,” of ways to “sweep it all under the carpet and make sure no connection could be fully established or proven.” Romanians were among the hackers present, it says, and the discussion touched on using Bulgaria as a location where they could “lie low.”\n\n> It is a felony for anyone to hack email accounts. Other laws forbid foreigners from contributing cash or in-kind services to U.S. political campaigns.\n\n> If Cohen met with Russians and hackers in Prague as described in the dossier, it would provide perhaps the most compelling evidence to date that the Russians and Trump campaign aides were collaborating. Mueller’s office also has focused on two meetings in the spring of 2016 when Russians offered to provide Trump campaign aides with “dirt” on Clinton – thousands of emails in one of the offers.\n\n'
'>But investigators have traced evidence that Cohen entered the Czech Republic through Germany, apparently during August or early September of 2016 as the ex-spy reported, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is confidential. He wouldn’t have needed a passport for such a trip, because both countries are in the so-called Schengen Area in which 26 nations operate with open borders. The disclosure still left a puzzle: The sources did not say whether Cohen took a commercial flight or private jet to Europe, and gave no explanation as to why no record of such a trip has surfaced.\n\nHOLEEE SHIIIIT.\n\n>Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller’s office, declined comment.\n\nTime to make an update to the ShitMuellerSays sub.'
'He took extraordinary steps to hide evidence of this trip--and has deliberately and repeatedly lied about it since. '
"Trump's lawyer was in Prague colluding with Russian agents summer of 2016 and his campaign chairman, Manafort knowingly had a Russian intelligence officer on his payroll. \n\nThis shit is about over."
'People have been debating whether Cohen actually went to Prague forever now. My guess was because they were so defensive about that point specifically that maybe Steele just had the location wrong. But if they prove it then it seems likely to me the part about Cohen paying off hackers there is also true. Which would be the smoking gun for "collusion"\n\nThis might just be the craziest month since this all began. '
'This is why Mueller et al didn’t give a fuck about the fallout from the Cohen raid. I knew they wouldn’t make that move without holding major cards.'
'This is why he’s more worried about the Cohen raid. Communication occurred directly with the Russians and was done through Cohen. '

'Lawyer here. Some responses are a bit off. **Mueller is offering immunity for the testimony in the Manafort trial, not blanket immunity from charges being brought against these 5 people.**\n\nIn other words, the government could not turn around and use testimony in the Manafort trial against these witnesses. But those witnesses could still be charged with crimes based on *other* evidence (and, it\'s worth noting, could still be charged with perjury if they give false testimony in the Manafort case).\n\nEdit: This is called "Use Immunity" and is codified at 18 U.S.C. 6002 et seq., for those who care to read the statute invoked by Mueller\'s team.

He is leaking to get that pardon before he's gotta be perp walked.  \n\nI can't seem to understand anyone else leaking other team Mueller.  The only reason for him to leak would be to put the pressure on Flynn to talk, but it seems unreasonable at this point to think that Flynn isn't already talking.  So why else would Mueller want to release this?  Maybe it's a signal to others that Flynn is fucked and talking, so they'd better come out and spill the beans now.

'This really makes me sad.\n\nEvery time Trump and his allies mutter the words "NO COLLUSION" it\'s a proven lie and a matter of court records. At the very minimum, Papadopolous, a member of the Trump campaign, has admitted to secretly meeting with two Russians (foreign nationals) to obtain dirt ("a thing of value") on HRC, in violation of 52 U.S. Code § 30121. The only reason why he wasn\'t charged with this crime or similar crimes is because he made a deal to cooperate with Mueller.\n\nAll of this is laid out as clear as day in his Statement of Offense (guilty plea). In addition he updated "three senior officials" dispelling the theory he was a low level, rogue operative. \n\nNone of this includes Trump Jr and his similar meetings.\n\nIt also shows how compromised the House Intel Committee is, once considered to be the one committee that should not be political.\n\nThe issue is Americans are just not willing to put in the effort to read the details and yes this includes many Democrats and Independents. So Trump continues the tactic that worked so brilliantly on HRC\'s buttery males investigation (that again many Dems and Independents fell for). Repeat the same soundbites and lies over and over again until it becomes "the truth" or at the very least the partial truth.\n\nEven with such a tight-lipped investigation as Mueller\'s, there is a wealth of information out there. This is not in the form of what could be considered bias news *but actual court documents.* It\'s just a matter of a willingness to spend the time, sift through the bullshit and find it.\n\nI understand court documents can be very boring to read but most of them have a factual summary at the beginning that I highly suggest people read.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.justice.gov/file/1007346/download\n\nhttps://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/30121\n\nEDIT: An article today backing up my comment:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8llhgh/yes_trump_aides_colluded_with_foreign_governments/\n\n\n'

This is why no one respects "independents" anymore--no one is independent because they\'re free-thinking anymore, they\'re independent because they have _no idea what\'s going on_. People who pay attention know that the most important thing right now is resisting the GOP.\n\nI can understand not knowing about _every_ guilty plea, but not knowing about any of them is unacceptable for any citizen of this country. This investigation is the event with the single greatest potential consequences on the US since the Civil War.'

'This may be because people assume that if they had uncovered crimes, Trump would be in prison right now.'

"My biggest comparison is Nixon\n\nBetween Watergate and his resignation, the investigation took two years. Two years of investigation gets collapsed to nothing with hindsight.\n\nWe're only one year in. These things take time to do properly when they're not a witch hunt"
"People are missing the point here (and also going on irrelevant fevered tangents).\n\nYou get subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury to speak about things you have witnessed or otherwise have knowledge of. If you lie, you can be charged with a crime, but this isn't meant to be a 'gotcha'. Bannon isn't the target at this time. Mueller is going after someone(s) else. It's also considered bad form to use the grand jury to go after a lower level person. \n\nSo either the target is a Bannon boss/same level inside the White House. That leaves Flynn, Preibus, Pence, Trump, and Trump family. We know Flynn is cooperating. Preibus has been interviewed but otherwise quiet. Pence has kept this nose clean so far. So that leaves Trump and family as targets.\n\nThere are also Bannon bosses outside the White House. The Mercers are tied to shady shit, including tax evasion. Given how they funded the campaign and brought in Cambridge Analytica, and how many foreign powers have connections to CA, potentially the Mercers/CA could be targets as well.\n\nNow here's the biggest point. Was the subpoena hostile in nature? Did Bannon refuse to testify willingly because he wants back in favor with Trump and Mercer? Or is this political theatre on Bannon's part? He may trying to signal to Trump and Mercer that he's willing to be a good team player again. Regardless, he's not stupid enough to lie in the grand jury so the practicalities are the same.\n\nEdit: I thought about another thing when I was getting a cup of coffee. Manafort and Gates have been playing hard-ball, even after their arrests and indictments. Bannon stepped in to Manafort's position and was surrounded by the same people and strategy Manafort instilled into the campaign. Potentially Mueller wants more information about how the campaign was operating and communicating with at that time to really puts the screws to Manafort's and Gate's."

'F5 Friday strikes again!'
'> found evidence that Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, committed bank fraud not addressed by the indictment last October\n\n>The filing by Mueller’s office says Manafort obtained a mortgage using “doctored profit and loss statements” overstating “by millions of dollars” the income for his consulting company\n\nLong story short: "This asshole can\'t stop breaking the law and maybe we should revoke bail."'
'Should be pointed out that Gates (named on the Manafort indictment, and charged with basically the same things as Manafort) is evidently being left out here, and the only thing we heard recently is that he was reportedly close to a plea deal. Gates has young children, and one wonders if the "new charges" that will be coming Manaforts way are a direct result of information provided in whatever the plea might be. '
'Ouch. That\'s 30 years in prison. David Simon (creator of *The Wire*) used to call that "The Headshot" when they brought it down on somebody.'
"I love the way Mueller works.  Start with little charges and if the perp gets all shitty instead of cooperating, start filing the bigger ones, one at a time.  By that point, the perp starts mentally inventorying crimes you haven't brought up yet, and the fear of what's to come flips them."
"That's right Mueller, squeeze that vice until that fuck talks"
'I\'m getting a whiff of a connection to the Russian indictments earlier today. Is it possible one of those indicted companies made payments to Manafort that he disguised as income for his consulting "business"?'
'This Friday is one for the history books. And also one to make Carter Page reach new levels of flop sweat.'
"I didn't get ANY work done today, and I'm Canadian. I can't imagine how much lost productivity happened in the US today because everyone was glued to the news... historic times!"
'There is some theory that Mueller has spread out these other allegations in a run at revoking his house arrest status and getting him held in custody pending trial. Coupled with flipping Gates he may want to crack Manafort. Hope he does. This villain can finger Trump I expect on Russian collusion. Let them all swing,but watch out for Pence coming up the backstretch. He can taste the Presidency, the viper.'
"If you read what was written. Mueller is basically saying that the property Manafucked leveraged for his bail was fraudulently financed. Meaning the bank could foreclose on the property and the government would have no monetary leash on Manafucked to keep him from running. I'm thinking they want the judge to put him in jail before trial."
'No one has mentioned that these indictments of Russians likely make Mueller and his investigation bullet proof.  No member of Congress can refuse to protect the investigation now that it is seeing results.  If Trump moves to fire Mueller now it will be seen by most citizens as obstruction.  Well played Mr. Mueller.'
'after suffering through 2017, 2018 is looking up.'
"Manafort is even more fucked, that much is clear. I'm not poo-pooing this any way whatsoever, so *please* don't downvote me just for asking this question...seriously, fucking please don't (and its a little bit sad I even had to preface it in this way, but I digress). It says Mueller hasn't signaled either way that he's gonna file additional charges on this front, though it sounds pretty obvious this will happen. So, is Mueller challenging the conditions of bail on the grounds of having discovered even further criminal behavior or on the pretense that he can't cover the bond??? Because as long as the property is in his name and subject to forfeiture, then it wouldn't matter if the loan was illicitly obtained, right???\n\nBecause if it is the former of those two, then this is a *very*, *very* big deal."
">A report in The Wall Street Journal last year said investigators from the office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman were examining loans that Manafort obtained in connection with various real estate transactions, including mortgages issued by Federal Savings Bank. That and other articles also noted that the bank’s chairman, Stephen Calk, was an economic adviser to the Trump campaign.\n\nYet other link in the chain. The bank that gave Manafort the loan in question was also a Trump campaign adviser. I'd say the bank wasn't aware of the fraud if it wasn't for this tidbit. Hope Muller follows the smoke. "
"Manafort thought he could sue and get rid of Mueller.\n\nOnly a fool tickles a dragon's tail"
'This fucking guy. Was casually reading about the Angolan civil war and of course his lobbying firm shows up in the story. '

'It\'s more than protecting Trump. This is about money and power. Also, I cannot stress enough how Republicans in elected office look at the political reality and landscape more correctly than elected Democrats do. They understand very well that it is about understanding that Democrats, that absolutely anyone opposed to you, needs to be decimated. When you have the power, you wield it with little to no regard for what the *opposition* feels about it. If people want to sue you let them. That\'s for the courts to figure out. In the meantime, you have an agenda to push for.\n\nThis shit is not a partnership. Democrats who view it as such as incredibly foolish and dangerously naive. Time to wake up. "Reaching across the aisle" and pounding your chest with pride that you are "bipartisan" when none of that flows from Right to Left, only Left to Right is **nothing** to be proud of.\n\nIf the Democrats ever get power again, all of us in the working class would do well to think on this and remember it so that we don\'t get complacent with Democrats and constantly demand more/better from them when they are in the position to actually make good on it if they would only pull their heads out of their own ass and get out of their own way. \n\n'

'"A mixture of gullibility and cynicism had been an outstanding characteristic of mob mentality before it became an everyday phenomenon of masses. In an ever-changing, incomprehensible, world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that everything is possible and that nothing was true. The mixture in itself was remarkable enough, because it spelled the end of the illusion that gullibility was a weakness of unsuspecting primitive souls and cynism the vice of superior and refined minds. Mass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst, no matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow. The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness."

"I think most people (not trump supporters of course) are smart enough to know Mueller doesn't leak information unless he specifically wants it public.

'This story about Alfa bank is bigger than people realize.  Bigly important history of Alfa bank and Trump Tower communications during the election. and in my opinion, the most underreported story of the election\n\n>\tTea Leaves and his colleagues plotted the data from the logs on a timeline. What it illustrated was suggestive: The conversation between the Trump and Alfa servers appeared to follow the contours of political happenings in the United States. “At election-related moments, the traffic peaked,” according to Camp. There were considerably more DNS lookups, for instance, during the two conventions.\n>\tIn September, the scientists tried to get the public to pay attention to their data. One of them posted a link to the logs in a Reddit thread. Around the same time, the New York Times’ Eric Lichtblau and Steven Lee Myers began chasing the story.* (They are still pursuing it.) Lichtblau met with a Washington representative of Alfa Bank on Sept. 21, and the bank denied having any connection to Trump. (Lichtblau told me that Times policy prevents him from commenting on his reporting.)\n\n>The Times hadn’t yet been in touch with the Trump campaign—Lichtblau spoke with the campaign a week later—but shortly after it reached out to Alfa, the Trump domain name in question seemed to suddenly stop working. When the scientists looked up the host, the DNS server returned a fail message, evidence that it no longer functioned. Or as it is technically diagnosed, it had “SERVFAILed.” (On the timeline above, this is the moment at the end of the chronology when the traffic abruptly spikes, as servers frantically attempt to resend rejected messages.) The computer scientists believe there was one logical conclusion to be drawn: The Trump Organization shut down the server after Alfa was told that the Times might expose the connection. Weaver told me the Trump domain was “very sloppily removed.” Or as another of the researchers put it, it looked like “the knee was hit in Moscow, the leg kicked in New York.”\n\n>Four days later, on Sept. 27, the Trump Organization created a new host name, trump1.contact-client.com, which enabled communication to the very same server via a different route. When a new host name is created, the first communication with it is never random. To reach the server after the resetting of the host name, the sender of the first inbound mail has to first learn of the name somehow. It’s simply impossible to randomly reach a renamed server. “That party had to have some kind of outbound message through SMS, phone, or some noninternet channel they used to communicate [the new configuration],” Paul Vixie told me. The first attempt to look up the revised host name came from Alfa Bank. “If this was a public server, we would have seen other traces,” Vixie says. “The only look-ups came from this particular source.”\n\n>According to Vixie and others, the new host name may have represented an attempt to establish a new channel of communication. But media inquiries into the nature of Trump’s relationship with Alfa Bank, which suggested that their communications were being monitored, may have deterred the parties from using it. Soon after the New York Times began to ask questions, the traffic between the servers stopped cold.\n\nhttp://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html'

Alfa Group, in turn, is the Russian bank that was engaged in mysterious internet traffic with a server in the Trump organization: http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html\n\nWho needs conspiracy theories to spicen up their life when we have Trump at the helm?"
'Isn’t it crazy that Trump supporters see this shit and all they say is “wow what a waste of time trump didn’t do anything wrong”  18 people indicted for committing crimes related to OUR election and these traitors wanna stop the investigation still. Trump supporters should WANT this investigation to keep going.'
"> Alex Van Der Zwaan was charged Feb. 16 with lying to the FBI ... *[sic]*  \n> Prosecutors charged Van Der Zwaan by criminal information, **which typically precedes a guilty plea.** ... *[sic]*  \n&nbsp;  \n\nZwaan speaks Russian also, and a strong connection to the Putin's crew of oligarchs.  \n\n&nbsp;  \n> he married the daughter of Russian oligarch German Khan ... *[sic]*  \n> **The unsealing of Van Der Zwaan’s case came four days after** Mueller accused 13 Russians of a sophisticated disinformation campaign ... *[sic]*  \n\n&nbsp;  \nThis is definitely a tactic by sending a signal to scare others in the whole Russia collusion. I wonder who else is crapping their pants.  \n&nbsp;  \nI bet Mueller is handing out lenient deals on a first-come first-served basis. I am surprised why there isn't a whole line of people at the Special Counsel's office like an Apple Store.  \n\n&nbsp;  \n\n> Van Der Zwaan told investigators that his last contact with Gates was an innocuous text message in mid-August 2016, when they actually spoke the following month about the Tymoshenko report in **a call the lawyer secretly recorded** ... *[sic]*  \n> &nbsp;  \n> Prosecutors also accused Van Der Zwaan of lying about his talks with someone else, identified by the government as Person A. The lawyer told investigators he last spoke with Person A in 2014, when in fact they spoke in September 2016 during the **secretly recorded call with Gates.** ... *[sic]*  \n\n&nbsp;  \nGates flipped by then already (or) he provided the recordings to Mueller during the interviews after his guilty pleas?  \n\n&nbsp;  \n\n> **Van Der Zwaan also deleted and failed to produce emails** sought by the special counsel and a law firm ... *[sic]*  \n\n&nbsp;  \nI wonder which law firm it is.  Oh I have to say an obligatory **#ButteryMales**.  \n\n&nbsp;  \n\n> The Justice Department had asked Skadden for information and documents related to its work for the Yanukovych government, the New York Times reported in September. ... *[sic]* ... **The firm’s $12,000 fee was modest, just below the amount that required public bidding. The following year, with no further work done, Ukraine sent Skadden $1 million.**  \n\nThey tried to fly low as much as possible, but got caught anyway."
"Holy shit he's from Skadden, this is fucking huge. "
"Its too early for a bomb... I'm still drinking my coffee and not ready for real world things yet."
"So far, all the witches in the witch hunt don't seem to be able to float."
'Mueller flipped Gates just last week and already he’s filing charges. \n\n\nWow. '
'If Trump is interviewed he goes down for perjury, period.'
'We just need Obama to tweet something along the lines of "I would never do the interview, there\'s no way I could handle that." Should do the trick. '
'Trump legal team is terrified of this interview with Muller. Mueller doesn’t even have to ask him anything related to the investigation and Trump would lie anyway. They can show him a photo of a chicken and Trump would say it’s a hamster.'
'Here is where the perjury usually happens.'
"Trump is going to get eaten alive if he's interviewed. After fire and Fury, it's clear Trump has no clue what truth is. It simply doesn't matter to him because he doesn't grasp the consequence of it. "
'What we need to do is spread the idea that Trump is too much of a pussy to meet with Mueller alone. '
'Trump: I plead ALL of the amendments. Some lightweights think the 5th is THE only impontant one. Sad! I know the Cornstitution better than perhaps anyone in history. Fake "lawyers" will see! '
"If Trump wants to prove there's no collusion, now is his chance."
'So trump actually is going to at least make a statement in some form to Mueller. That means at the very least, we’re guaranteed charges of false statements/perjury!'
"Who's willing to bet he'll try to fire Mueller during the interview, just as he starts getting uncomfortable?"
'Oh poor Mueller, having to listen to that verbal diarrhea for an hour or more. '
'I would give everything I have for a full length, unedited, 4K video of Trump being interviewed under oath.\n\nCan you just imagine the volumes of shit that would pour from Trump’s grotesque mouth like a broken sewer pipe as he wilted under the quiet, meticulous gaze of a man like Robert Fucking Mueller?'
'With his verbal diarrhea and inability to filter, Trump is the textbook example of why people should never voluntarily talk to the police.\n\nThis should be good.'
'If they aired this live, I would miss my own funeral to watch it.'
"So when Trump said he was a 'stable genius', he meant the type of 'stable genius' that can't be trusted not to incriminate himself out of sheer dumb fuckery."
'trump is going to fuck himself hard. '
"No collusion, no collusion, you're the collusion."
'This idiot will have perjured himself within the first 30 seconds'
"Trump's lawyers could not be so foolish as to let Trump speak on the record with Mueller. Trump is walking perjury. If Mueller gets a chance to question him, Trump will happily put his neck in the noose. He's too stupid not to."
"There's no legal benefit to him doing an interview. Any other politician (like one interested in continuing their career) might want to but I don't think he cares about that enough to risk this. However, if we make fun of him and say his lawyers are handling him he might sneak away and say some shit just to show everyone he's in control."
"I smile thinking of how Mueller will have to keep a straight face while asking Trump questions. I mean, short of his name, he's going to lie his ass off about every single thing asked. He's not even capable of telling the truth, probably because he believes his lies ARE the truth."
'Trump interview under oath = instant perjury. '
'Can’t wait till this asshole lies under oath. It’s inevitable.  He is a chronic liar and can’t help himself when pressed. '
"Priebus needs to make up for his historic failure of not spiking Trump's candidacy at the convention when he had the chance.   Part of this debacle is on his cowardice."
"> Priebus is said to have argued against the Comey firing, and he is not believed to be a target of the investigation.\n\nPreet Bharara has a podcast now and he said something on one of his first episodes that stuck with me: In an investigation, you're either a subject, a witness, or a target. Nobody stays a subject for long.\n\nSounds like somebody is a witness."
'Guarantee he spilled the beans on that Air Force One flight where they came up with the Russia meeting lies'
"He met with Trump earlier this week then Trump flipped out. \n\nThat's not good. "
'Donnie Dotard shitting his XXXL diapers right about now.'
"Priebus didn't join until the transition period but he would have a lot of info on the context around Comey's firing"
'That would explain the extra insanity from the big pumpkin week to keep attention shifted elsewhere. Your president is going to prison.'
'Explains the hyper unhinged crap this week.  Wait, or was that last week?  Hard to keep it straight.\n'
"I'm kinda sad there are less and less pro-Trump posts in controversial sort lately. \n\nWhere ya'll at? "
'Of all the cowardly rats that orbit the Slob in Chief Priebus would be the cowardliest.'
'>Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing.\n\n^ Fake news.'
"Moral of this story. \n\n\nDon't fire your friend via Twitter, and leave them stranded in the rain at the airport. "
'The only way this ends well for America is if all the old GOP stalwarts; the Bushes, the Romneys, McCain, Ryan (I guess), do an infomercial where they tell their constituents "The Russians used our good name to sell you a poison pill. Here\'s Joel Osteen to tell you how to spit out Satan\'s lies."\n\nOtherwise we\'re going to have a civil war when he\'s impeached.\n\nHell, we might have one anyway, maybe with Hannity shooting at the Union soldiers while they reload.'
"My doctor put me on Wellbutrin after the election. I can't take this anymore. Every day, every fucking day it gets worse. I want off this fucking ride!"
'And yet another "He can\'t be that dumb, can he?"\n\nI was so wrong. LOL this is comedy gold.'
"Can we be serious for a minute? This is the Hydraulic Press channel in Fast Food Review format about music. I like the idea, and from the few videos I've seen he seems genuine but exaggerating which is expected, but we all know this ends up like a Dayyum Daddy of 5.\n\nEdit: I seem to have responded to the wrong thread, I'm leaving it tho."
"meh Priebus doesn't know shit, he wasn't a Trump guy. I want to see Manafort up in that mofo. "
'Revenge of the Toadie '
"There's so much shit that happens daily with this administration, I feel like Ben Kenobi just hearing Priebus's name."
'So standard Trump procedure is for Trump to hop on Twitter and start talking shit about Priebus, right?'
'Incoming smear campaign against Preibus funded by his own party.'
'That the damn truth.'
"I got told by both my senators that it's ok for him to travel so much to his properties because a president is always working. \n\nThen they immediately start complaining about wasteful government spending and how they are working to stop it by cutting funding. Fucking hypocrites."
'Republicans have lost ALL right to complain about ANY future president, they have lost ALL of their arguments, fiscal responsibility? HA! family values? What a joke! '
'Comrade Trump Colluder and Obstructionist in Chief. That’s probably why he called it the “winter White House.” Unfortunately, your colleagues never corrected him about that.'
"Let us remember that Mueller expenses are also Trump's fault. If he wasn't a corrupt treasonous piece of shit, and didn't fire Comey, we won't need this investigation."
"I'd rather have my tax money go to crucial criminal investigations rather than lolgolf anyway, so..."
"The Mueller investigation is Trump's fault too, you know. "
'Well, one is a distraction that wastes a lot of money, and the other is the Mueller probe.'
"Serious question: where does this price tag come from? Is it because Secret Service has to be there? Wouldn't Secret Service have to be in the White house or where ever anyway? Or is he incurring these costs through flights and I guess other stuff?"
'Leaders of banana republics make their countries broke through frivolous shit like this.'
"From Trump's own twitter:\nWe pay for Obama's travel so he can fundraise millions so Democrats can run on lies. Then we pay for his golf.\n\n2:35 PM - Oct 14, 2014"
' What degree is he dumping taxpayer money into his own pocket by staying there?'
"That shouldn't matter; Trust in government is invaluable."
'So we have Mooches as a unit of time and now Largos as a unit of cash.'
'Everyone, read the damn article. If you read it, it says THIS IS NORMAL and hat Obama had the same estimated cost. If you compare, so have 23 other presidents. So clam down. '
"Entire article:\n\n> Robert Mueller may be pursuing a previously unknown angle in the Russia investigation - whether wealthy Russians illegally funneled cash to the president's campaign or his inauguration.\n  \nI’m excited too but what the fuck is this ‘article?’\n\nEdit: I’ve been made aware that the video content addresses the headline. "
"Just a side suggestion, can we all agree to go back to F5 o'clock being PM instead of AM? This is killing me on the west coast...."
"Well, it's not like Trump has any money."
"Geez, the amount of collapsed comments in this thread... What's emboldened the users at that_place to leave their hidey-holes this time??"
'Trump is going to prison for a long, long time.'
"LOL.  Considering his (trump's) lovey-dovey russian track record over the years?  Wasn't this a foregone conclusion from anyone?\n\nStill, in spite of it all...."
'As frustrating as it is waiting for Mueller to finish, It is equally as heartening to think there is so much skulduggery being uncovered and piling up that it will crush this flaming turd of an administration. '
'For this news, Headline is enough no need to look at the video.'
'Yea we fuckin know. Whats with these empty headlines. '
'We’re in a giant-ass room filled with smoke everywhere...we just need to find the gun. '
'Citizens United has opened our democracy up to what amounts to political contribution money laundering from foreign states. I fear politicians have no incentive to stop this. '
"What's insane to me is that even the Bush jr campaign had standards. They were there. This guy shows up and just blows everything out of the water."
'Republican wide spread conspiracy. It is what it looks like. Russian money laundering to all republicans. Been called it. We need a deep state now. Book em mueller.'
'Are mueller conspiracy theories all this sub talks about?'
'People:Could the corruption of this administration be more blatant? \nTrump: Hold my hooker piss. '
"How long until it's confirmed that Trump asked for Russia's permission on the weapons transfer?"
'Oh for fuck sakes. On top of everything else, this admin is now making Iran-Contra look like no big deal. '
"No matter what crime I had ever committed, I really couldn't imagine being so self-interested that I would alter foreign policy and affect millions of lives just to suit my own personal interests.\n\ncc: Jared Kushner"
'If Trump was colluding with Russia why would he arm Ukraine? '
'This is actually autistic, the left screamed for months about Russia, Russia, Russia, and now countering Russia in Ukraine is proof of Russian collusion. '
'This headline seems to be a contradiction all to itself'
'The weapon sales were pushed by Congress in order to punish Russia, so it is not like Trump pulled the proverbial trigger here. \n\nThis is probably more about Ukraine turning into a third world country. The politicians who took over after the revolt have worked hard to corrupt the system. The current Prosecutor General of Ukraine does not even have a law degree.\n\nThem throwing law to the wind in order to appease the US for more guns should surprise nobody.'
"So Trump is soft on Russia because he 'colluded' with them....but he gave weapons to Ukraine to kill Russians with because....he colluded with Ukraine not Russia? I am confused and my tin foil hat is first generation so please explain, or let me borrow one of your hats."
'Was anticipating a swathe of Trumpologists claiming this headline to be an example of post hoc ergo propter hoc until I recalled that they stoutly refuse to speak Mexican.'
'Hypothetically, if it turns out that this whole investigation was just a coup to try and remove Trump, that is was all fake, no collusion, no obstruction... would you accept that and move on?'
'im tired of being angry/outraged. i cant do this anymore. cant mueller end this investigation already?'
'Interesting. Because Trump & Co’s *only* change to the GOP platform at the convention was to **stop** weapons from getting to Ukraine..\n\nNow what could Ukraine give Trump that would make him do a 180 on this position that was obviously important to him.\n\nOh, right. It’s in the title.'
"Isn't this really just Russia giving Ukraine weapons to fight Russia? "
"Legally, this isn't treason.\n\nBut according to Merriam-Webster, if Trump bribed Ukraine to interfere in this probe? That is *totally* treason. And an egregious example of it at that."
'It’s no longer irony making the Republican states red.  '
'this is the first time I\'ve said "holy shit" outloud to myself reading something.'
"Nice try Donny, but it won't save you from Mueller."
"Collusion with Russia to win the election? Waging war with Russia after to thank them? I don't get what is being investigted. Is Trump an evil genius that can seemlessly play both sides for his own ends or a complete buffoon?"
"Is that why Russia isn't helping investigate Hillary?  Because she gave them so much Uranium?"
"This season isn't even believable anymore. It's do outlandish I might stop watching. "
"And we're meant to believe Trump is a pro-Russia partisan? Hard to believe when Trump's admin keeps supplying one of Russia's biggest enemies with anti-tank missiles, rocket launchers, money, funding, and diplomatic cover. And that's after the US snatched Ukraine out of Russia's sphere of influence and put it under it's own under Obama- provocational to say the least."
'Same thing with Kim Jong Un not helping Mueller anymore suddenly hmm'
"Trump is really dancing a knife edge on this. Giving your ally's enemy aid to protect yourself on the home front against alegations that your ally helped you cheat in an election. "
'Meh, I’m okay with helping arm Ukraine against a Russian invasion. Ukraine had over 50% of their military sold by pro Russian ministers to prepare Ukraine to be invaded. I thought people here hated Russia and are constantly demanding something be done. '
"If the white house was able to get Ukraine to stop cooperating with Mueller by giving weapons to Ukraine, perhaps now Russia will be willing to cooperate with Mueller in retaliation. Wouldn't that be interesting?"
"He's going straight out Oprah on these fuckers. You get a subpoena, you get a subpoena...."
'Jesus, we are going to see literally days of people sitting on a stand testifying to this asshole’s treason'
'That’s a lot of motherfucking subpoenas, in case anyone was wondering.'
"How do blank subpeonas work? \n\nIs this the equivalent of a regular subpeona with the name withheld? Is the goal to just not cause a media furor prior to bringing these people in, if they're a flight risk especially?\n\nCan he just flip a switch at some point in the future and suddenly all of them are delivered with recipients filled in?"
'How big is the court room at the place it’s at? Just out of curiosity.\n\nAlso, lordy. 70 subpoenarinos. There’s a lot of nervous people out there right now.'
'Hear that Donny?  That is the sound of your doom.  I hope it is hard and long and miserable for you.  '
"Holy shit that's a lot of subpoenas "
"Mueller knows what the fuck he is doing. He's an American superhero."
'Uh oh. Weissmann is starting to apply some serious pressure on Manafort.'
'Geez, all I did was get lunch and come back 30 mins later to another F5 bomb dropping. I might as well go home, no work to be done today!'
"I don't think he is actually issuing 70 people with subpoenas.\n\nIt is at least 36, because they are issued in sets of 35.\n\nI doubt he is using all 70.\n"
'In the words of Lester Freeman--\n\n"Follow the money."\n\nGod damn right. '
'<Meanwhile on Fox they keep repeating "there\'s been no evidence of collusion."'
'F5 OVERLOAD'
'70?!?    o_O   dayum\n\na whole lot of trumspter divers gonna get fucked.'
"For any other president a day like this would've probably permanently crippled their entire administration. For Trump it's just an exceptionally bad day"
'We are going to get a lot of people admitting to shit real soon.'
'Time and time again, there just seem to be so many things that are [similar to Watergate](http://oneworldpress.net/2018/04/20/tale-of-the-trump-administration/). These cases are just so similar that you cannot help but hope that their presidencies will eventually end in the same manner. '

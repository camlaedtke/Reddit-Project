'This!! This is what we Democrats need to be doing! We need to show that we are proud of our country, but not proud of what our country is doing.  This will create a divide between those who may support (R) party politics due to ignorance.  I have a neighbor who thinks Democrats have no love for America.  He flies a big American flag on his house, he\'s in the military, and he loves his country.  He is also a moron who doesn\'t watch the news and isn\'t paying attention to what is happening.\n\nSo!

When i look at all this talk of collusion that infers over half the union only hated Hillary because of Russian lies i can\'t help but think you\'re all too caught up in the art of politicking. Because really, the only motive anyone should be comfortable attributing to Putin is making Russia seem more powerful than they are which is why they engage in this stuff.  The Democrats have mutually benefited by making them look more influential while also making them the scape goat for their loss.  This has always been Russias MO and that\'s why this "scandal" is perceived as such a wet fart from the other side as it should be apparent one hand is washing the other. I\'m all for stopping Russia\'s efforts to do this stuff but i think people need to accept that Trump won legitimately as a starting point in mending the Democratic party because if it\'s all hysterical nonsense from this point on they are gonna be fucked cause the kind of hate and anger the democrats are fostering right now just isn\'t that relatable to regular people.'

The paper ballots are just slips of paper, boxes, and a bunch of volunteer vote counters and watchers.  If you want to safeguard your local state elections, **push for paper!**"

But considering the indictment only refers to the person as a "candidate" rather than a current elected official, there\'s a chance the person did not get elected. \n\nI want to think Mueller is holding back on the identification because either 1) the person didn\'t get elected or 2) there\'s still an ongoing criminal investigation into the person, or frankly both. But if the person did get elected I think it\'s in the best interest of the country to identify the person and get him or her out of congress immediately. '
"Folks, this is a big deal. Not only does this conclusively prove that Russian Intelligence actively supported the Trump campaign and attacked the Clinton Campaign, the indictment also says that:\n\nA) Someone in Trump's inner circle had contacts with Russian intelligence and (p.16) and B) a GOP candidate personally solicited stolen documents from Russian intelligence. (Also on p.15-16)\n\nThis is high treason against the United States. Pure and simple."

' I read both the White House’s readout and the Kremlin’s. Of course the Kremlin’s was a lot longer and more detailed (but truthful? Who knows about *that*). Neither one mentioned something that seems important to me. \n\nWho initiated the idea of meeting “sometime in the not too distant future?” \n\nTrump repeated that phrase three times during the presser. We know this phone call wasn’t on the official schedule. We know there have been rumors before of the administration attempting to disable recording of calls between the two and Putin not being confident that they weren’t being recorded (I have no idea whatsoever if this is true but I have read some articles about it). We know that Trump has a history of having unannounced side meetings with Putin at world summits; meetings where Trump doesn’t bring a translator. \n\nGiven everything we already know, I gotta ask: is it possible that Trump is the one who proposed the meeting during this call today? And if so, could it be because he really, really wants to talk to the Kremlin about something outside the ears of his cabinet, law enforcement, and U.S. intelligence? \n\nI have always believed that the whole “Russia, if you’re listening I hope you can find Hillary’s emails” statement was a public form of accepting Russia’s offer of cooperation to him. His campaign was approached and offered the quid pro quo setup, and when he was ready to “make a deal” ( 🙄this fucking guy) he made that statement at the rally. I think Jared Kushner’s attempts at backchannel communication, and its subsequent exposure, along with the white hot scrutiny of the press and Mueller, help explain why Trump would be motivated to do stupid shit like this. He has no remaining ways to communicate with Putin other than official channels.\n\nMaybe I’m jus a tinfoil hatter. Who knows. '

The developer in Vancouver, Tiah, bonded with Donald Trump Jr. But Ivanka Trump played a key role in getting the deal off the ground in 2013, two years before Trump officially launched his presidential bid.\n\n> Tiah flew to New York for a meeting at Trump Tower. In the board room featured on The Apprentice, they hammered out the contours of the deal.\n\n> "One of the senior vice-presidents pulled me aside and said: \'Joo Kim, it\'s really important in your presentation that you connect with Ivanka. In other words: no one else is in the room, you have to understand that," Tiah recalled at the October 2015 launch of a "Trump Luxe" VIP service for condo residents. "In that meeting, it was clearly just me and Ivanka talking about the project," he recalled.\n\n> After an agreement was reached, Ivanka Trump recalled at the same event that she worked closely with Tiah: "We were working on a lot on the design elements and really forming the vision."\n\n> "Ivanka and myself approved everything, everything in this project," Tiah added.\n\n> Holborn is backed financially by Tony Tiah Thee Kian, chairman of TA Enterprise, which controls several other businesses. The elder Tiah has a checkered business history, including securities laws violations and false statements to the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange, according to the Malaysia\'s Securities Commission. Joo Kim is the face of Holborn.\n\n> As with other Trump properties, the Vancouver tower easily attracted foreign buyers. **The Vancouver Sun reported last year that one of the buyers in the project has links to the Chinese government.**'

A formal note of protest was lodged, the official said, but Russian authorities asked for evidence that the person had been drugged, and the Americans lacked samples.\n\n>When investigators sought timesheet records for personnel working at the hotel where the U.S. officials had been staying, the hotel managers said there were none for that particular period, the official added -- a claim that also raised suspicions.\n\n-\n\n>A 2013 report by the State Department\'s Inspector General said "employees face intensified pressure by the Russian security services at a level not seen since the days of the Cold War."\n\n>**Michael McFaul**, the U.S. ambassador from 2012 until February 2014, was on several occasions accosted by crews from state-controlled television channels who showed up outside his private meetings without prior notification, prompting Washington to complain to Moscow about security concerns.

'To all the idiots who are saying that he was approached with the info from the former president, you\'re leaving out some important facts:\n\nA. McConnell and the top Republicans told Obama that if he made this public, they\'d just say that Obama made it up to get Hillary to win. In other words, they blackmail\n\nB. Obama did what he could as the outgoing president and while hampered by the Republicans. For example, deporting the Russians and closing the place where they were reportedly doing this from. \n\nBy the way Trump reopened it to the Russians not long after. \n\nAnother example is that Obama added sanctions, which Trump took away. \n\n\nC. It was Trump\'s responsiblity to continue and strengthen what Obama started.

'I just re-watched the Trump/Putin presser and something occurred to me - when asked if he would denounce Putin and Russia\'s attack, he said, essentially "Coats told me Russia did it, Putin is right here, he told me they did not." I think, essentially, he doesn\'t internalize or understand evidence or analysis (mainly because he\'s functionally illiterate), he believes people who he wants to believe because they agree with him or flatter him. And he only pays attention to or understands about 10% of what is verbally communicated to him, at best. For Trump, the decision of what to say in that press conference comes down to "Does Trump like Dan Coats or Putin more"? And the answer is - of course - Trump dislikes Coats because he takes away all of Trump\'s triumphant glorious election win by talking about Russian election influence, while Putin says Trump is the most great and powerful president in all of American history - and your hands your hands are so very extremely large and ow, that handshake, it just crushes me, you are such a big strong president.

"and\n\n11/10/2016 - Obama warns Trump about Flynn\n\n11/18/2016 - Trump names Flynn National Security Advisor\n\nref: https://themoscowproject.org/collusion-timeline\n\nLieutenant General (ret.) Michael Flynn resigned from his position as national Security advisor after it was revealed that he lied about having direct contact with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the campaign. U.S. intelligence officials believe that Flynn illicitly led the Russian ambassador to “expect a reprieve from sanctions” from the incoming Trump administration. On several occasions during the campaign and transition, Flynn allegedly privately discussed U.S. policies toward Russia,\nincluding sanctions, with Kislyak, and he later lied to the public and the FBI about the nature of these discussions. Flynn has denied that he discussed sanctions with Kislyak. **Flynn met with Kislyak on an social visit to Moscow in 2013, during which he became the first U.S. officer to enter GRU (Russian military intelligence) headquarters**. Flynn traveled to Moscow in December 2015 to attend a gala dinner hosted by Russia’s state-sponsored media giant, RT, where he sat at the same table as Vladimir Putin. He was reportedly paid $45,000 to attend this event. Flynn’s son is also reportedly under investigation, with a focus on the lobbying work he completed for his father’s lobbying firm Flynn Intel Group. On **November 5, 2017**, multiple sources reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team believe they have sufficient evidence to bring charges against both Flynn and his son as part of the ongoing investigation into alleged collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russian government officials. ref: https://themoscowproject.org/players/michaelflynn/\n\n**December 1, 2017**: Michael Flynn pleads guilty to making false statements to FBI agents.\n\n**July 10, 2018**: In the seven months since Flynn pleaded guilty, it’s unclear what assistance he’s provided to prosecutors. The special counsel’s office has not cited him as a witness in court papers so far. But it’s clear prosecutors believed he could be valuable enough to cut him a more favorable deal. In his plea agreement, he admitted to acting as an unregistered foreign agent for Turkey, a federal crime, but he wasn’t charged with the violation. Flynn is not the only person from Trump’s team who agreed to cooperate with the special counsel’s office. Rick Gates, the Trump campaign’s former deputy chairman, pleaded guilty in February. His sentencing has not been scheduled. ref: Judge again delays sentencing for Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security advisor\n\n**July 13, 2018**: The Special Counsel indicts **12 members of Russian military intelligence, known as the GRU**, for engaging in a sustained effort to hack the computer networks of Democratic organizations and the Hillary Clinton campaign. Count 1 Conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, Counts 2 -9 Aggravated identity theft, Count 10 Conspiracy to launder money, Count 11 Conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States. (Period from 2015-2016)\n\nThe indictment tells us \n\n>The hacking and coordinated release of stolen emails is what collusion looks like. The sequence of events offers a clear case study in how the two campaigns to elect Donald Trump—one based in Trump Tower and one based in Russia—colluded.\n\n> 1 - Russia wanted to help Trump and used its intelligence and espionage tools to illegally hack the DNC and the Clinton campaign.\n\n>2 - The Trump campaign also wanted Russia’s help to get the “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. They were willing to work with a foreign intelligence service hostile to the United States to defeat their political opponent.\n\n>3 - These two campaigns then met and coordinated. And when Russia chose to use WikiLeaks to anonymously release the stolen emails, the Trump campaign sought to communicate with WikiLeaks as well.\n\n>4 - The email releases were timed to provide maximum benefit to Trump.\n\n>5 - Trump then made the email releases central to his campaign strategy in the final month. \n\n>Combining Russia’s espionage capabilities with the Trump campaign’s unique and granular understanding of the American political landscape, especially its data-targeting expertise, would have greatly aided both campaigns. The two campaigns met and conversed repeatedly for months, providing ample opportunity to hammer out a strategy to amplify each others’ messages to increase Trump’s chances in the election. The question now is no longer whether there was collusion; it is how deep the\ncollusion went. ref: https://cdn.themoscowproject.org/content/uploads/2018/05/17084235/Collusion-Case-Study-Report-5.17.pdf"
"It's been known. What's unforgivable is the now POTUS' response to it. Forget Justice or dignity, he just had to get on his hands and knees in front of Putin. "
'[Full Schiff Statement:](https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=361)\n\n-\n\n> “Today, the House Majority has announced it is terminating the Russia investigation, leaving to others the important work of determining the full extent of Russian interference in our election, the role of U.S. persons connected to the Trump campaign in that intervention, possible efforts to obstruct the investigation by the President and most important, what needs to be done to protect the country going forward. While the Majority members of our committee have indicated for some time that they have been under great pressure to end the investigation, it is nonetheless another tragic milestone for this Congress, and represents yet another capitulation to the executive branch. By ending its oversight role in the only authorized investigation in the House, the Majority has placed the interests of protecting the President over protecting the country, and history will judge its actions harshly.\n\n-\n\n> “Next week, it will be one year since our investigation began with its first open hearing, and the country learned that the Trump campaign had been the subject of a counterintelligence investigation since July of the election year. Since that time, we have learned a great deal about countless secret meetings, conversations and communications between Trump campaign officials and the Russians, all of which the Trump Administration initially denied, would later misrepresent, and finally be forced to acknowledge. Thirteen Russians have been indicted in a far reaching conspiracy in which the Russians sought to influence our election by helping Donald Trump, hurting the Hillary Clinton campaign and sowing discord in the United States. Most significant, high-ranking Trump campaign and Administration officials have also been indicted, including the President’s national security advisor, his campaign chair and deputy campaign chair, as well as one of his foreign policy advisors, and three of those have already pled guilty.\n\n-\n\n> “During that first open hearing of our investigation, I asked whether we could conduct this investigation in the kind of thorough and nonpartisan manner that the seriousness of the issues merited, or whether the enormous political consequences of our work would make that impossible. At that time, I said that I did not know the answer, but ‘if this committee can do its work properly, if we can pursue the facts wherever they lead, unafraid to compel witnesses to testify, to hear what they have to say, to learn what we will and, after exhaustive work, reach a common conclusion, it would be a tremendous public service and one that is very much in the national interest.’\n\n-\n\n> “Regrettably, that challenge proved too much. The Majority was not willing to pursue the facts wherever they would lead, would prove afraid to compel witnesses like Steve Bannon, Hope Hicks, Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump Jr., Corey Lewandowski and so many others to answer questions relevant to our investigation. It proved unwilling to subpoena documents like phone records, text messages, bank records and other key records so that we might determine the truth about the most significant attack on our democratic institutions in history. Instead, it began a series of counter-investigations, designed to attack the credibility of the FBI, the Departments of Justice and State, and investigate anyone and anything other than what they were charged to do — investigate Russia’s interference in our election and the role the Trump campaign played. Ironically, even while they close down the Russia investigation, they plan to continue trying to put our own government on trial: this is a great service to the President, and a profound disservice to the country.\n\n-\n\n>“Some will say that we should leave the investigation to Special Counsel Mueller anyway, since he has the resources and independence to do the job. But this fundamentally misapprehends the mission of the Special Counsel, which is to determine whether U.S. laws were broken and who should be prosecuted.  It is not Mueller’s job to tell the American people what happened, that is our job, and the Majority has walked away from it. Others may be tempted to say a pox on both houses, and suggest that in a dispute between the parties, both must be equally culpable. But after months of urging the Majority to do a credible investigation, the Minority was put in the position of going along with a fundamentally unserious investigative process, or pointing out what should be done, what must be done, to learn the truth. We chose the latter course.\n\n-\n\n> “On a fundamental aspect of our investigation — substantiating the conclusions of the Intelligence Community’s assessment that the Russians interfered in our democracy to advance the Trump campaign, hurt Clinton and sow discord — we should have been able to issue a common report. On those issues, the evidence is clear and overwhelming that the Intelligence Community Assessment was correct. On a whole host of investigative threads, our work is fundamentally incomplete, some issues partially investigated, others, like that involving credible allegations of Russian money laundering, remain barely touched. If the Russians do have leverage over the President of the United States, the Majority has simply decided it would rather not know. On the final aspect of our work — setting out the prescriptions for protecting the country going forward — we will endeavor to continue our work, with or without the active participation of the Majority.\n\n-\n\n>“In the coming weeks and months, new information will continue to be exposed through enterprising journalism, indictments by the Special Counsel, or continued investigative work by Committee Democrats and our counterparts in the Senate. And each time this new information becomes public, Republicans will be held accountable for abandoning a critical investigation of such vital national importance.”'
'There you have it, folks: Republicans are okay with foreign interference in a democratic election of it helps them win.\n\nFor some of us there was never any doubt, but now we\'ve got the proof. \n\nThis is an absolute gut punch, even for folks like me who always expected the worst, like the difference between knowing one has cancer and hearing the doctor say the word. That last spark of hope, snuffed. This feels like election day all over again, and the bitter realization that so many of my fellow Americans would put party over the wellbeing of their nation.\n\nI hope their thirty pieces of silver were worth it, traitorous bastards. \n  \nI don\'t always have a visceral emotional reaction to the news, but this hits home.  Not since election day when 62,000,000 of my fellow Americans said "Yeah, thanks for bringing the unemployment rate down to 4.6%, and doubling the stock market, and halving the number of uninsured, and passing the biggest banking reforms since the New Deal, and improving America\'s respectability around the world, but we think it\'s time to elect a racist, sexist, xenophobic, misogynistic liar, with no job experience, no relevant education, and a long history of ripping people off.  Yeah, raising the minimum wage sounds okay, but cutting taxes for millionaires and billionaires sounds better.  And sure, expanding health care coverage sounds like a good idea, but how about we gut it instead?  Yep, reducing the debt and deficit would be fine, but blowing it up would be even better.  Clean water tastes good, but I prefer coal ash.  Sure the 1st amendment protects freedom of the press, but here\'s an even better thought, let\'s gimp libel laws and sue people like you\'ve never sued before!"  \n  \nSeeing 62,000,000 Americans vote for a racist, sexist, xenophobic asshole was a kick in the gut.  Seeing the House Intelligence Committee end their investigation is a kick in the gut too.  \n  \nDon\'t get me wrong, I never doubted that Republicans cared more about power, more about their party, than they did about the American people.  When it comes to so many subjects, regulations, gun laws, environmental protections, education, taxes, the budget, judicial appointments, wages, and a thousand others I\'m not going to take the time to list, it was clear that Republicans were willing to throw their country and their constituents under the bus.  "If kids want clean water let them lift themselves up by their bootstraps I say!"  That\'s not new news to anyone who\'s been paying attention since the party began its decline somewhere around the Nixon era, it\'s been obvious how little they care about us for some time now.  \n  \nBut this?  Turning a blind eye to clear interference in a democratic election, a speck at the very heart of what this nation was built upon?  It\'s a kick in the gut.  Knowing that Republicans would sell out the soul of this country for 1.5 trillion pieces of silver is offensive beyond measure, beyond words, it makes me sick.  Not metaphorically sick, but physically nauseous.  \n  \nMany of us have known that there was a cancer in our country, we\'ve watched it grow and spread, rot bone and poison blood alike, we *knew* our nation was ill, we *knew* the diagnosis.... but this is like hearing it from the doctor himself.  \n\n"I\'m sorry to say it\'s quite advanced, maybe if we\'d caught it sooner..."  \n  \nThere was never any doubt, but there was *the hope of the doubt.*  Maybe, just *maybe* it\'s not as bad as it looks like, *maybe* the pain is unrelated, *maybe* it\'s just swelling, *maybe* it\'ll go away on its own, *maybe* I\'m going to be okay.  The hope of the doubt, that perhaps all the signs we\'ve been ignoring and explaining for so long were wrong all along.  \n  \nThen the doctor calls and the breakfast that I couldn\'t stand to eat erupts out of me and onto the floor.  \nI always knew, but *now I know,* and knowing is somehow worse.  \n  \nJudas sold out his beloved friend for 30 pieces of silver, and now we know how much it would have cost to sell out all of Rome.  \n  \n/rant\n\nThere\'s some irony in this.  I was discussing gun reform today, and one of the talking points that inevitably comes up is "We need the 2nd amendment to defend ourselves against tyranny!" and when I look at my government today *I see tyranny.*  But what would happen if you and I and all the rest rose up *against* that tyranny?  Not a revolution, but a civil war.  [Donald Trump has an 87% approval rating among Republicans (it\'s gone up 2 points in the wake of the recent Florida shooting), and am 8% approval rating among Democrats,](http://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx) America can\'t even agree whether or not Donald Trump is the greatest President since Reagan, or the worst since....

'Cause the GOP has always been a shining example of integrity. Lol okay.'
"Reminder that Mueller's job is to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election, an investigation that has resulted in numerous indictments and guilty pleas. He was not specifically tasked with investigating whether or not Trump colluded with Russia, that is just a natural area the investigation has led.\n\nSo if Republicans try to use this as an excuse to get rid of Mueller, you know it means they're afraid of what he's uncovering. There is no reason the HIC's conclusion, even if it was accurate, should lead to terminating the special counsel. They concede Russia engaged in active measures against the United States during the 2016 election, and that is what Mueller is investigating.\n\nHe should be allowed to continue that investigation until it is complete, and follow whatever leads he finds, including leads the HIC actively chose to ignore.\n\nAnd to Trump supporters here to troll us: Imagine a parallel universe where Hillary won the election and Democrats had majorities in the house and senate. Chelsea Clinton is brokering peace in the middle east, Podesta is Secretary of Education, whatever. It's your worst nightmare. The HIC, led by Adam Schiff, begrudgingly took up a half-hearted investigation into her emails, uranium one, etc. During this investigation Democrats refused to subpoena key witnesses, released a memo containing cherry-picked bits of classified information that fit their narrative, then ended the investigation and released a partisan statement with no input from Republicans on the committee that claimed Hillary had been exonerated. Would you accept their conclusion and happily move on with your lives?"

'I think "**Russia has the most beautiful hookers in the world**" is a code phrase used by the Russians and their assets to either tell people to take action, or for one asset to innocuously ask someone if they\'re also an asset. Putin said it during a speech he knew would be heard by Trump in January 2017. Trump then later repeated it to Comey a couple weeks later.\n\nCall me paranoid, but I get the impression that Trump has been a Russian asset since at least the \'90s. That\'s around the time that US banks would no longer lend to him and he had to go abroad to with his hat out. I\'m thinking he got into debt with the wrong people, and just when he was panicking that they were coming for him - or his loved ones - he was approached by Russia\'s Foreign Intelligence Service  offering to make it all go away.\n\nKeep in mind Trump has had access to the White House, US Presidents, and America\'s elite for decades. Between that, his self-serving nature, and his money problems - he would be the ideal mark.\n\nI\'m not talking James Bond activity, just "get this politician doing cocaine/a hooker in front of this hidden camera". This would also explain why Trump & Co have never really faced prosecution - it\'s possible he and his handlers have enough blackmail material to shut down any investigations that threaten the asset - until Mueller.\n\nIt\'s totally possible I\'m just paranoid, but if true - America is in a lot more trouble than people now realize...'

'1. Forget "collusion", look at just Russian interference in the 2016 election. There is overwhelming evidence that a nuclear power which has *never* had the best interests of the US at heart, intentionally interfered in the presidential election and managed to tip the results to their preferred candidate.\n\n2. Said candidate, now president, talks regularly on the phone to leader of said power, which again, never has the US\' best interests at heart.\n\n3. Said president also starts treating former allies like crap, while treating this foreign power like its best buddy.\n\nWhy y\'all aren\'t surrounding the White House with millions of people brandishing torches and pitchforks is, seriously, completely beyond me.'
"Okay well that's definitely a good thing and I'd start getting nervous the days when they do *not* keep in touch with, at least, some regularity. \n\nOf course Russia isn't what it used to be, is a relatively poor 2nd world country BUT it still occupies a massive swatch of the earth, holds a lot of geopolitical power and influence and still has old weapons. \n\nPutin may not be our most important ally or even the 10th most important ally. But he might be one of the USA's top 'Frienemies' and all the more reason to keep up good regular conversations going. "
"Maybe it's true, maybe it isn't.  No reason to trust Putin or Trump though.  \n\nThe fact is both are trying to lie their way through the world, so we need to start worrying what is best for US."
'trump\'s side of the conversation " yes Sir....no Sir, no. yes of course Sir....ok, thank you Sir, thank you"'

'I also speak to my boss pretty regularly. Is normal to want to keep a good communication with your boss.'
'The full exchange wasn’t in the article. This is unbelievable.\n\nRead the full exchange below:\n\nReporter: Did Russia\'s attempts to meddle in US elections come up in the conversations?\n\nTrump: "He said he didn\'t meddle, he said he didn\'t meddle. I asked him again. You can only ask so many times."\n\nReporter: Today?\n\nTrump: "I just asked him again. He said he absolutely did not meddle in our election, he did not do what they are saying he did."\n\nReporter: Do you believe him?\n\nTrump: "Well, look, I can\'t stand there and argue with him, I would rather have him get out of Syria, I would rather get to work with him on the Ukraine rather than arguing about whether or not... that whole thing was set up by the Democrats. Look at Podesta, look at all the things that they have done with the phony dossier. Those are the big events. But Putin said he did not do what they said he did. But we have a good feeling toward getting things done. If we had a relationship with Russia, that would be a good thing. In fact it would be a great thing, not a bad thing, because he could really help us on North Korea. We have a big problem with North Korea and China is helping us. And because of the lack of the relationship that we have with Russia, because of this artificial thing that\'s happening with this Democratic-inspired thing. We could really be helped a lot with Russia having to do with North Korea. You know you are talking about millions and millions of lives. This isn\'t baby stuff, this is the real deal. And if Russia helped us in addition to China, that problem would go away a lot faster."\n\nReporter: On election meddling, did you ask him the question?\n\nTrump: "Every time he sees me he says I didn\'t do that and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it. But he says I didn\'t do that. I think he is very insulted by it, which is not a good thing for our country. Because again, if we had a relationship with Russia, North Korea which is our single biggest problem right now, it would help a lot. I think they are doing very well with respect to China, they have cut off financing, they have cut off lots of oil and lots of other things, lots of trade and it\'s having a big impact. But Russia on the other hand may be making up the difference. And if they are, that\'s not a good thing. So having a relationship with Russia would be a great thing especially as it relates to North Korea."\n\n"Hillary had her stupid reset button that she spelled the word wrong, but she does not have what it takes to have that kind of relationship where you could call or you could do something. But this is really an artificial barrier that\'s put in front of us for solving problems with Russia. He says that very strongly, he really seems to be insulted by it and he says he didn\'t do it. He is very, very strong in the fact that he didn\'t do it. You have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he has nothing to do with that. Now, you are not going to get into an argument, you are going to start talking about Syria and the Ukraine."'
"Well Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump are the two most honest people I know so I guess that's that.\n\nLooking forward to see you in leg irons, Donnie."
"Obviously he doesn't. He is just amplifying Putin's denial in an effort to tell his base it didn't happen. \n\nBut let's look at the optics of this:\n\nThe President of the United States is lying and saying he disagrees with the previous POTUS, the CIA, the NSA, the FBI, the Pentagon, his own Secretary of Defense, his own Secretary of State, his own Department of Justice, and even Congress which is controlled by his own party.\n\nPutin won.

'>But the White House has given no indication that canceling the summit was even considered, and Trump said in his CBS interview that he was approaching the meeting with “low expectations” and pledged that “nothing bad” would emerge from the one-on-one discussion. \n\n>“I think it\'s a good thing to meet. I do believe in meetings. I believe that having a meeting with Chairman Kim was a good thing,” Trump said, referring to his summit last month with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “I think having meetings with the president of China was a very good thing. I believe it’s really good. So having meetings with Russia, China, North Korea, I believe in it. Nothing bad is going to come out of it, and maybe some good will come out.”\n\nFirst of all, the President* sounds like Vincent Adultman talking about meetings. Secondly, it\'s remarkable that the man who always over-promises and under-delivers is tempering expectations with just this one "diplomatic" relationship.

"First,\n>...Trump said in his CBS interview that he was approaching the meeting with “low expectations” and **pledged** that “nothing bad” would emerge from the one-on-one discussion.\n\nTrump is a pathological liar so why should we interpret this as anything but a deliberate attempt to mislead the American people?\n\nSecond, this tweet from Trump, dated 14 July 2017 -\n>The stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration, not the Trump Administration. Why didn’t they do something about it, especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September, before the Election?\n\nWell, the Obama Administration did do something about it - they actually began acting in July 2016, but discretely. \n\nIf Trump were an honorable actor who was innocent of the charges of being a Russian asset, and who had no knowledge of the Russian influence on his election, he'd use the full power of his office & the agencies of the US government to shut that shit down.\n\nBut he isn't an honorable actor, he's the vain-glorious orange Mussolini we've detested for varying lengths of time. \n\nAnd the Republican Party that enables him are equally culpable.\n\nIf there is any justice, Donald Trump will die in prison, his family's fortune will be stripped from them & they'll have to work for a living like any ordinary person and the Republican Party will be dissolved.\n\nLincoln would hang his head in shame.\n\n"
"another version, with links to references\n\n11/10/2016 - Obama warns Trump about Flynn\n\n11/18/2016 - Trump names Flynn National Security Advisor\n\nref: https://themoscowproject.org/collusion-timeline\n\nLieutenant General (ret.) Michael Flynn resigned from his position as national Security advisor after it was revealed that he lied about having direct contact with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the campaign. U.S. intelligence officials believe that Flynn illicitly led the Russian ambassador to “expect a reprieve from sanctions” from the incoming Trump administration. On several occasions during the campaign and transition, Flynn allegedly privately discussed U.S. policies toward Russia,\nincluding sanctions, with Kislyak, and he later lied to the public and the FBI about the nature of these discussions. Flynn has denied that he discussed sanctions with Kislyak. **Flynn met with Kislyak on an social visit to Moscow in 2013, during which he became the first U.S. officer to enter GRU (Russian military intelligence) headquarters**. Flynn traveled to Moscow in December 2015 to attend a gala dinner hosted by Russia’s state-sponsored media giant, RT, where he sat at the same table as Vladimir Putin. He was reportedly paid $45,000 to attend this event. Flynn’s son is also reportedly under investigation, with a focus on the lobbying work he completed for his father’s lobbying firm Flynn Intel Group. On **November 5, 2017**, multiple sources reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team believe they have sufficient evidence to bring charges against both Flynn and his son as part of the ongoing investigation into alleged collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russian government officials. ref: https://themoscowproject.org/players/michaelflynn/\n\n**December 1, 2017**: Michael Flynn pleads guilty to making false statements to FBI agents.\n\n**July 10, 2018**: In the seven months since Flynn pleaded guilty, it’s unclear what assistance he’s provided to prosecutors. The special counsel’s office has not cited him as a witness in court papers so far. But it’s clear prosecutors believed he could be valuable enough to cut him a more favorable deal. In his plea agreement, he admitted to acting as an unregistered foreign agent for Turkey, a federal crime, but he wasn’t charged with the violation. Flynn is not the only person from Trump’s team who agreed to cooperate with the special counsel’s office. Rick Gates, the Trump campaign’s former deputy chairman, pleaded guilty in February. His sentencing has not been scheduled. ref: Judge again delays sentencing for Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security advisor\n\n**July 13, 2018**: The Special Counsel indicts **12 members of Russian military intelligence, known as the GRU**, for engaging in a sustained effort to hack the computer networks of Democratic organizations and the Hillary Clinton campaign. Count 1 Conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, Counts 2 -9 Aggravated identity theft, Count 10 Conspiracy to launder money, Count 11 Conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States. (Period from 2015-2016)\n\nThe indictment tells us \n\n>The hacking and coordinated release of stolen emails is what collusion looks like. The sequence of events offers a clear case study in how the two campaigns to elect Donald Trump—one based in Trump Tower and one based in Russia—colluded.\n\n> 1 - Russia wanted to help Trump and used its intelligence and espionage tools to illegally hack the DNC and the Clinton campaign.\n\n>2 - The Trump campaign also wanted Russia’s help to get the “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. They were willing to work with a foreign intelligence service hostile to the United States to defeat their political opponent.\n\n>3 - These two campaigns then met and coordinated. And when Russia chose to use WikiLeaks to anonymously release the stolen emails, the Trump campaign sought to communicate with WikiLeaks as well.\n\n>4 - The email releases were timed to provide maximum benefit to Trump.\n\n>5 - Trump then made the email releases central to his campaign strategy in the final month. \n\n>Combining Russia’s espionage capabilities with the Trump campaign’s unique and granular understanding of the American political landscape, especially its data-targeting expertise, would have greatly aided both campaigns. The two campaigns met and conversed repeatedly for months, providing ample opportunity to hammer out a strategy to amplify each others’ messages to increase Trump’s chances in the election. The question now is no longer whether there was collusion; it is how deep the\ncollusion went. ref: https://cdn.themoscowproject.org/content/uploads/2018/05/17084235/Collusion-Case-Study-Report-5.17.pdf"

'I can’t say it enough. The social media and DNC hack were bad. The GOP was just as susceptible seeing as how it was a phishing attack that was publicized to be the breach, but they were the favored party; so why would they use whatever they may have found. I’m guessing there *was* a successful phishing attack on the GOP, but there was no need to use anything gained yet.  \nAll of that aside...   \nThey didn’t need to compromise voter roles.  \nThey didn’t need to compromise vote tallies.  \nThey didn’t need to compromise a single voting machine.  \nThey only needed to alter the distribution of voting machines in a couple of key counties in a couple of key states. That would be the easiest *and* most effective way to compromise the vote, and would require exactly zero voter fraud to occur.'

He\'s come out of the meeting scolding Putin with no meaningful follow up or making excuses for him to buy himself more time.\n2. Putin puts some very bad ideas in his head to embolden him to fire Mueller, Rosenstein, or otherwise do something bad. Worryingly, the appointment and confirmation in the Senate this week of Benczkowski to head the DOJ criminal division, former Alfa Bank lawyer with no prosecutorial experience makes me think this is the most likely next step for Trump. I\'d be interested to know the timeline between Rosenstein briefing Trump and Benczkowski\'s nomination, which puts him in line to succeed Rosenstein.\n\nI really hope it\'s not #2. Former CIA/NSA Dir. Hayden just told Jake Tapper he expects the next round of indictments to include Americans. Based on what we see in the indictments today, that\'s almost a given. Mueller and Rosenstein just made it impossible to justify their removal by Congress, but who knows with Trump.\n\nI would expect things are going to accelerate here. Hopefully in a good way, but who knows what Trump will do.\n\n"Therefore, the art of war lies in: never face a high mountain, never retreat from a down hill, never follow an enemy army faking defeat, never attack an elite enemy army, never bite a shark-bait, never chase after a retreating enemy army, **leave opening for a surrounded enemy army, never pressure a desperate enemy** **army**. This is the art of war." *The Art of War* by Sun Tzu, Chapter Army Conflict\n\nIt sure feels like the Trump-Putin summit is the opening for Mueller, Congress, and America to see how Trump tries to escape.'

"Impeachment, much like an indictment, shows that there is enough there for the case to proceed and at this point there is certainly enough there for the case to proceed."\n\n**Edit:** We\'ve updated the article, headline and added comment from Sen.

'Beto is currently in the middle of a campaign himself, he’s trying to gain some attention. I’m from El Paso and he doesn’t even have full support here.

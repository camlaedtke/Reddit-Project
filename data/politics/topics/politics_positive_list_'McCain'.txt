'I’m back to being OK with McCain being endearingly referred to as a maverick. '
"Cool John ! That way California and New York can decide all future elections . Us folks in the midwest shouldn't even bother to vote ."
"If you have an issue with this, please look up the definition of gerrymandering and how it is used to divide communities. Gerrymandered districts are not built on community lines, they are hacked together for political parties' needs (on both sides). Are you really pro-gerrymandering? "
'Lol the people will have to wait until lobbyists, billionaires, corporations, the military-industrial complex and all the other various players have taken what they can.'
'John McCain is my favorite republican!'
'It is bizarrely refreshing to actually see both sides working together for the good of the people.'
'We should not have to rely on the supreme Court to resolve this anyway. After Baker v Carr, the country should have taken a serious look at our nonsensical election system and overhauled it via constitutional amendment. The current arrangement basically acknowledges a gaping flaw in the system and instead of repairing the system we just told the admin to fix it when it gets too bad. \n\n'
'I have a question. Is it possible for a republican to run against Trump in 4 years and be able to win the primaries?'
"I was a Republican in 2000 and hated the Electoral College. I supported Bush but felt like the election was stolen from Gore thanks to the Electoral College and subsequent court cases. \n\nI'm a Democrat now and supported Clinton and feel like the election was stolen from her. I just don't see the US getting rid of the Electoral College."

"Funny how there's a bunch of anti-McCain comments here in the past few hours. Got me curious, but then I checked what time it is in Moscow, and it turns out it's 2:30 pm. Everything makes sense now."
"Seems like he's just trying to make things right before he dies.  Its kinda nice, but kinda sad."
"While I'm happy he said this, should he really be allowed to still be serving and voting on things? "
"Democrats have been saying this for years, now a republican says it and he's a hero? "
'Does the shape of the Congressional district matter that much when whoever wins will be bought by the same corporate donors?'
'Dear McCain:\n\nProve it. Americans can get rid of the President. Do it.\n\nSincerely, Canada.'
"This is the reason I'm gonna convince my friends to vote, even if they don't care about politics. We have to convince the American people to be on the right side of history because Trump is sure trying to take down this country with no end in sight."
'Putin must be enjoying this so much. '
"It's put up or shut up time, Mr. McCain. Propose legislation to protect the special counsel and limit the president's ability to harm America. Reign him in, or own the legacy of enabling his administration. It's not too late to do the right thing, but everything in your history tells me you are unlikely to do it."
'Americans should also remember which party put us in this position.'
"Thank God for McCain's empty words--they really made a big difference!"
"This is such BS. Easy to talk and not act isn't it, Mr. McCain? "
'I appreciate the sentiment but the symbolism of this statement coming from a dying man may not be the message we want to send.  '
"I wish McCain's actions were as solid as his words lately. He talks a big game, but generally falls in line with the GOP shitshow."
"If we really did stand with them - like *really* did stand with them - we'd fundamentally alter our political system at an absolute minimum. Electoral college being the first thing addressed along with Citizens United."
"I like Senators who don't wait until they're dying to be patriots."
"Trump's dismantling decades-strong friendships in just a few hissy fits. Can we please stop him?"
"lmao well that's fucking meaningless. "
'Well to be fair... this country (for better or for worse) has elected this guy.  So it **is** basically "us" not wanting to stand with the rest of the world. (even if most of us are being dragged behind this burning garbage truck against our will)  \n\nI mean, isn\'t that right?'
'So much hate for McCain but he is on of the few Republicans I respect '
"Honestly? That's not good enough America.  We can't make deals with you if the next president is constitutionally allowed to do what he likes and rip up those agreements. "
'As a Canadian, I stand with honorable, reasonable, and reliable Americans.\nI do not stand with McCain.'
'How many supposed McCain supporters here actually voted for him and Sarah Palin?\n\nYeah thought so.'

'Thank you, Senator McCain. Please stick to your word.'
'Thankful for John McCain today. \nKEEP CALLING. '
'Good on him.\n'
"I don't think Donald Trump likes John McCain."
'McCain being a thorn in the side of this administration and the people trying to push forward shitty bills to appease said administration is one of my favorite growing trends of 2017.'
'Is he holding out for a ~~bribe~~ special consideration for Arizona? [Like Alaska](http://reason.com/blog/2017/09/21/gop-leaders-are-trying-to-bribe-an-alask). Or is he actually standing up for something?'
'"We should not be content to pass health care legislation on a party-line basis, as Democrats did when they rammed Obamacare through Congress in 2009," McCain added. \n\nRammed???  Let\'s put all of Obamacare\'s hearings up against the hearings for ALL of the Republican repeal bills, and let\'s see which side tried to "Ram" it through.'

"McCain I don't know whether to like you or hate you, but right now I think you're pretty ok."
'You know there are things you can actually *do* to ensure that happens, right Senator? '
'The Republicans commenting now are a funny bunch. Flake, Gowdy en McCain are on their way out so try to save face while doing fuck all. Meanwhile Rubio and Ryan whisper something and will take it back just as fast. '
'People are so sure Mueller has nothing, if so then why is Trump trying to stop him?'
'Ah I see McCain is concerned again, I am sure this time he will do something other then opening his mouth (/s)'
"And what is McCain gonna do about it?  Say your deeply concerned and that's it?  Grow some balls, introduce a bill to protect the investigation!"
"It's funny to see the GOP acting like they're going to do anything WHEN Mueller gets fired. Traitors."
"If anyone here is from a state that has a republican senator, can you please give a call to the senator's office to come out with a strong statement against firing Mueller?"
'McCain, the Republicans voice of reason.\n\nThis is truly the strangest timeline '
'Why do we need a " bill" to protect an investigation? I just don\'t get it. If someone is investigated they should not be allowed to tamper with that in any way or face jail. Isnt that how it works for us normal people? \n'
'And if it isn\'t, I\'m sure he\'ll be "deeply concerned" again.'
'I\'m sure he\'ll be "outraged at this unacceptable outcome" but still vote to support Trump and the republicans 98% of the time.'
"More like 'un*peded*'."
"Since this happened by one vote, I'd also like to note the hard work of freshman Senator Tammy Duckworth.  Had she not defeated Republican Senator Mark Kirk in Illinois last year, this would have been a completely different result."
"McCain did vote to proceed and make it seem that McConnel held the votes for it to pass. I really think that McCain played Turtle here. Mitch would _never_ get the bill to the floor if he wasn't sure about it. So McCain voted to proceed and talked to Ryan and McConnel just to let it crash and burn afterwards. Now they need a 60 vote majority for it to pass. It's the long game guys. Or I'm seeing things.\n\nThat's why he deserves credit. Because of his mind games. Murkowski and Collins played their role and did not let their people down. But that was expected. McCains vote was not."
"All three of them should be honored for there votes. I think McCain is getting the attention because he was an unknown, the other votes were expected, but that fact doesn't diminish that they have saved millions from losing healthcare."
'I really respect Murkowski and Collins alot now. They both showed a lot of guts under enormous pressure.'
"I really like how people are focusing on three people while completely ignoring how the entire democrat party defends people's healthcare repeatedly. "
"I knew the liberal media wouldn't allow an old, white male too much positive attention."
'Saved obamacare? Yay for less doctors, forced taxes, and higher premiums. '
'Hey he deserves credit too. '
'McCain is getting attention because he was a wildcard. Had he voted yes, Pence would have broken the tie and the repeal would have been successful. '
'Thankful for all three. Anyone who stands up to the Tea Party gets my respect. Rob Portman is a spineless sack of shit. \n'
'How about some credit for the entire Democratic caucus, Senate and House?! \n\nNot a single member defected. Dem Unity! Thank you Schumer. '
'I was thinking this on my drive in to work today.  McCain causes this problem, gets lambasted by the media, and then "saves the day".\n\nMeanwhile Murkowski and Collins have defied party above country and the wrath of their peers and the president to do what\'s best for the people they represent.  They deserve a hell of a lot more credit than they\'re getting.'
'Really it was Bernie Sanders who deserves the credit. '
'Also credit to every single democrat in the room. There were 51 votes against.'
'There are people that actually like Obamacare? \n\n\nGreetings from a bewildered European.'
"I think to be fair we can give a few people credit.  Let's not discredit a man who came into vote who has terminal cancer... "
'I mean, everyone who voted against it gets credit.  There was a one vote difference.'
"Guys, the reason McCain got more attention is merely because he's a bigger figure in Congress. I've honestly never heard of Murkowski or Collins, so having them in the title of major news articles wouldn't get as much attention."
'Reddit went ape over McCain last week moving forward and now praises him. The masses are as fickle, as the president that presides over this country. '

'Or you could just credit everyone who assisted.'
'I\'m just really fucking sad for our country. The office of the President and the standing of our country has just gone down the drain so damn much.\n\nI really don\'t know how anyone can respect this man. He\'s a terrible person through and through. \n\nI\'m honestly sitting here trying really hard to think of one single good thing he has done and I can\'t. Even thinking "oh, he set up a charity!" But nope, as its come out even that is for terrible purposes.\n\nI\'m just really sad that people see Trump and think "yes."\n\nBut I guess it is because they see their self in him and it makes them feel empowered. I don\'t want the President to be like me, I just want him to have my best interests at heart even if we don\'t agree on all things. \n\nI\'m just sad.'
'Remember guys Republicans support the troops.'
"The day Trump leaves office will be celebrated worldwide.  At this point, I don't care how he goes (I do have a preference, mind you) - he just has to go."
'Trump is a truly vile man, and people who cheer him on in this are equally vile.'
"You can't be a Christian and a Trump supporter. "
'I relate to this plainspoken approach. He just talks like any regular guy off the street from my opioid-ravaged wasteland of hookworm-addled diabetics.'
'"Human garbage continues to behave like human garbage"'
"Remember when John McCain pushed back when that woman at his rally called Obama an Arab? The modern GOP can't stomach that sort of dignity. "
'And his cult cheered his every word.'
"Still, he praises Putin. \n\nI honestly am not sure Trump is an American. If you told me he's sworn an allegiance to a foreign power like Russia, I'd have no trouble believing that. "

"The sort of person who would apologize for saying something like that probably wouldn't have said it in the first place."
'Even if McCain had voted to repeal Obamacare I would still respect him.  He spent 5 years as a POW and rejected offers to go home early so that others who had been in captivity longer would go first.  He is everything Trump is not even if I disagree with him about pretty much everything.  When he dies, I will ill mourn his death as a true American hero and statesman.'
'Revenge is a dish best served to orange assholes.'
'He is a narcissistic sociopath. He has never done anything in his life that he feels he should apologize for, and you should apologize to him for even suggesting such a thing.'
"Has Trump ever apologized for *anything*?\n\nSeriously, I can't think of a single example"
'Has Trump ever apologized? I googled "Trump apology" and it\'s just articles of him demanding other people to apologize to him. '
'Just because some people haven\'t been paying attention all along...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6HKc24oUiE\n\n"I like people that weren\'t captured."\n'
'Trump will never under any circumstances apologize for anything.  I guess some view that as a positive characteristic, I don\'t.  Like he could clear up TONS of bad press by acknowledging mistakes owning them and just saying something along the lines of "Yeah I\'m impulsive, It wasn\'t my intention and nor how I truly feel. I\'m sorry for XYZ"  It would lose it\'s worth after so many times though, which he has passed long ago.  He has no choice but to double, triple and more down on everything so far...this man will ride america to the ground at this point for his own pride.  \n\nGreat people don\'t always do great things. Great people OWN their shit though. Trump will one day write on the walls with said shit.  Fuck that man.  On the upside, I haven\'t liked football in 20 years and I\'m kind of back into it now, which is neat.'
"He isn't a war hero. He's a war monger"
'He should apologize to all POWs for suggesting that being captured somehow means you deserve less respect for your service.'
" I disagree with McCain over nearly everything. However, I can still recognize a dedicated public servant, a hero, and an honorable man. Trump isn't fit to serve him lunch let alone criticize his integrity."
"Let's not overstated his comment. McCain was asked if Trump ever apologized. He answered no. Then he moved on. \n\nMcCain give couldn't care less that Trump never apologized. The title makes it seem like it was his comment outright. "
'This is what the tea party Republican executive branch looks like... They are the Christian fascists of the US.'
'revenge is a dish best served by not voting to repeal and replace. '
"I doubt Trump has apologized sincerely for anything in his life--he's a sociopath."
'Has Trump apologized for anything, ever, in his life?'
"Let's remember that this statement more-or-less launched his Republican primary primacy. Put him at the center of the debate stage because it put him highest in the polls. I think it's less a reflection of the Right's hypocrisy on respecting military service, and more about the inanity with which they view McCain as a RINO. "
"I don't think Trump has ever apologized for anything.   "
'Lol, I like people who weren’t captured. '
'He eneded up voting no on the straight repeal.  He voted yes on allowing debate.   We will see how he votes on the "skinny repeal"'

'Why do we keep referring to Health Insurance regulations as Healthcare?\n\nThe *healthcare* itself is *not* affordable. But for some reason, we have become okay with only applying regulations to the *insurance* companies. \n\nWhy not focus on making the *healthcare* itself affordable?'
"Well, turns out maybe he's a hero after all."
'No, he did not. He voted to have open discussion on health care. In the discussion he explicitly said he will not vote for the bill. I am on your side on healthcare, but you all are making yourselves look foolish.'
"I am not American,\n\nI can not understand why Americans do not look after their own and aim to have the healthiest people in the world, which they are more than capable of achieving, healthy people make more money, but you have this mindset of  'i am not taking care of anyone else as it may cost me money',\n\nIt is cheaper to keep people healthy than it is to get them back to health."
"He still is a hero to some. Not me, but look at it from other's perspectives. I'm middle class and the ACA has done nothing for me. Do I think it should be repealed? No. But there are people who do. There are people who believe the government shouldn't be in the business of providing health care. I'm not one of them but this is all opinions and subjective. "
'It could not be clearer. Republicans are the scum of the earth.\n\nMcCain is in the top tier of the scum of the earth.'
"It's good that McCain is speaking up, but he needs to rally the GOP to resist these concerning moves"
"It's your party McCain"

'Soon, they’ll just be referring to him as “All the rich, orange faced perverts...”'

"Good for McCain. We haven't passed nearly enough sanctions on Russia for their interference in our elections. And they're still doing stuff like setting up faux-Alt right rallies and spreading misinformation. We need to hit back harder."
"I like presidents who don't get compromised."
'This should be read as "McCain gently reminds the media to report on how Trump has been acting in defiance of the Russia sanctions bill, for 10 fucking days now". \n\nHe\'s putting this back in the news, against Trump\'s best efforts to distract you.

"It's beyond comprehension that McCain won't step down from his Senate seat before the end of May. If he steps down before the end of May it forces an election in 2018 whereby the people of Arizona have a choice to elect a representative. Instead, if he keeps his seat until June the Republican governor will most likely pick a Republican replacement who will sit on that senate seat until 2020.\n\nWe know McCain will never vote in the senate again. But his last act as a politician might be to thwart representative government. I would hate to have to remember him that way. I hope he has the courage to step down before the end of May."

If you're trying to apply basic rules of human decency to anyone affiliated with Trump, you're going to be confounded.\n\nAnd it wasn't a joke, they were just being honest.  They don't see McCain's opposition as relevant because he can no longer vote against their priorities.  That's all anyone is to them, useful or to be discounted.  "
'It wasn’t a *joke*, it was “telling it like it is”, which is a core conservative value.'
'There is literally no way in which the Republicans help this country progress forward. Not one.'
"They won't apologize to anyone but Putin.  It's been demonstrated so many times in the past.  Why is anyone surprised?  I think people should express their dislike for them not doing it, but to say it's surprising is giving the White House and its squatters too much credit."
'The best they would come up with would be sorry not sorry anyways.  '
'The running joke that Republicans just want people with the sensibilities of impulsive insult comics to represent them is just true now. They see decorum as a vice.\n\nLike if Andrew Dice Clay ran for office, dude would get in.'
'Reporting that this statement was a joke is profoundly detached from the truth. '
"Who cares what Bernie says? He's dying anyway\n\n\n\n\n /s"
"C'mon, Bernie, pay attention! At this point the only real surprise about the Trump presidency is how shockingly popular he still is."
'It\'s because it wasn\'t a "joke" Sir...\n\nThis is our President. He\'s "our" President because not enough people (a) voted & (b) know what a decent leader is.  Good job America\n'
"You can't say you are pro-veteran and be okay with this.  "

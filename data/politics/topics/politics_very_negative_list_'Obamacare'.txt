"McCain has brain cancer and had to fly to D.C. from his home state when he should be recovering. \n\nCollins and Murkowski were consistent in their position and have to deal with more insults than others because they're women.\n\nAll three have done a great thing, and this pissing match is pointless.  "
'I gave Collins and Murkowski a lot of shit for their committee vote to allow DeVos to move onto the Senate confirmation vote.\n\nBut damn, they took Aaron Burr duel threats, threats that affected their states and they still stood by their vote.  Capito and Heller showed to be spineless though .'
'Anything to avoid admitting the hysterical spam about McCain was bullshit, am I right thinkprogress?\n\n'
"What McCain did was consistent with his behavior throughout his life. I often disagree with him, but he's not a hypocrite like so many of the GOP. \n\nMurkowski and Collins showed integrity and backbone throughout. It took ovaries of steel to stand against all the pressure, wheedling, threats and excoriation they have been subjected to. I'm taking some time today to send each of them a proper handwritten thank-you note, just like my mama taught me."
"All these sites were dead wrong about McCain and now seem too proud to eat crow. It's embarrassing, and a bad look. "
"McCain has the biggest name by far, flipped unexpectedly and has a mountain of good will because he's going to die within the year. Lol at this women circlejerking shit getting pushed to the top of this sub. Literally 3 articles about that in the top 10. \n\nY'all shit on a dude with brain cancer and you don't even have the balls to admit you were wrong"
'Fuck obamacare. Seriously. It made everything so much worse. All it did was make premiums EXPLODE. I wish that every piece of shit that voted to save this travisty of a healthcare plan was forced to use it. Good for gooses and ganders and all. '
"Once we have single payer you won't see rich Canadian's come down to the US for their surgeries anymore.  They'll be stuck in the same lines as the rest of the Canadians."
"I wouldn't say they saved it.  I'd say they doomed people to continuing higher premiums and mediocre coverage. "
'You guys are outrageous. After being completely wrong about McCain and spamming this sub about how big of a coward he was, he proves you all wrong. But instead of digressing you people find a way to discredit him as much as possible. '
'TIL deceiving your constituency and lining the pockets of private insurance CEOs at the expense of poor people who can\'t afford health insurance through ridiculous penalties and tax increases == "Saving Obamacare"'
'Collins and Murkowski had to face all kinds of threats from their own party (possibly threats of a funded primary fight, threats of destroying their political futures, even threats against their entire state, etc.), and who knows what McConnell and Trump promised them in return for a YES vote. Also, they have been vocal about ACA repeal, providing cover for other Republicans to break ranks.\n\nSo, a tip of the hat to them!'
"How about everybody who voted against it gets equal credit, okay? The fucking mental gymnastics required to keep the anti-McCain circle jerk alive are absurd. \n\nDuring his time in the Senate, he voted for a bunch of shit you didn't like, and some shit you did like, and did a bunch of other stuff you never even saw that was both good and bad. Now he's gonna be dead in a year so it doesn't really matter what he thinks. Can we stop trying to pretend that his vote here was anything but good?"
"The women in the photo were also getting death threats and threats of violence against them by their fellow Republicans.\n\nHeroes indeed, but I bet you in this instance, they are happy a guy (McCain) jumped in to make it so they aren't the only targets of hatred, and if he gets most of the share of the hate, they might be OK with that too"
'Now, Trump is going to do everything in his power to make ACA fail. Then, when it does, he\'ll say "I told you so". Sadly, a lot of people will be dumb enough to fall for it. '
'Not really.  GOP affords a loss of votes.  They did not expect McCain to vote nay, I think.  They did expect these two women to vote no, though.  Not really one person doomed this bill - all 51 of them are equally responsible for saving the aca.'

'>Later in the day Ms Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, the other Republican senator for Alaska, allegedly received calls from the Department of the Interior warning them that the state’s future was now under consideration.\n\nPetty fuckers running the White House '
"threatining Alaska with isolation is like threatining London with rain, Germany with efficency and the Mets with bad baseball.\n\nIt's their core quality dummy!"
'He has absolutely no respect for the institution of the US government and the importance of checks and balances whatsoever.  \n\nThis is an authoritarian stuck in a non-authoritarian government.  And I mean that very seriously.  Not like the whiny, misinformed nonsense that people accused Obama of.  This is a *real* authoritarian who will burn down what he can to gain more power.  '
'... and nobody is stopping this moron ?'
"Hahahaha. Fuck off Trump. I hope she laughed at that Department of the Interior stooge. Despite all the tweets and hot air billowing from that orange fuck's face, nothing has happened. There is no wall. Obamacare repeal just got defeated.... again, transgenders are still waking up on American military bases across the world. He's done NOTHING. Just throw temper tantrums like a spoiled idiot child. Fuck off Trump. "
'Trump panders to a core of conservatives whose values aren\'t as much American as they are pre-medieval European. \n\n"Conservative" often means preferring a current or even historical status quo and resisting change or novelty. There is a core of conservatives who have always preferred the status quo of, say, 1000 a.d. Britain.\n\nThe rule of law has only recently become the way most of the world works. In past times there were other rules, like the rule of various deities, the rule of monarchy (usually representing the deities), etc. In early- and pre-medieval Britain conflicts were often resolved among and within tribes and communities with vendettas, blood feuds, etc. You raped my sister? I\'ll rape yours. You killed my brother? I\'ll kill two of yours, and so on. Importantly, concepts like personal and family "honor" were vengeable things: if your "honor" were threatened, that was a reason for retaliating with violence. Same with your family\'s "honor" or your clan\'s "honor." This system was stable for a very long time, but "stable" doesn\'t mean "peaceful;" it was incredibly violent.\n\nOver time, as clan chiefs began to consolidate territories and make bigger kingdoms, those "kings" now wanted some protection from being caught up in this endless cycle of death and blood swirling around any given village they might be visiting. "[The King\'s Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_law)" or "The Peace of the King" became a thing. This meant, at least at one point, that a certain radius of distance around the king must be peaceful--say, 100 yards, or a mile, or something. No violence allowed within that circle, even if you had a really good reason. If you ignored that rule, then *you* were punished, despite the fact that you were probably just dishing out some much-deserved justice! Crazy!\n\nEventually, this concept was [incorporated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_peace) into English Common Law, which was the basis for modern English law and American law (the idea that our laws were originally biblical is utter bullshit). After a few centuries, this "rule of law" really took off, to the point where even kings and queens could sometimes be threatened with "the law." Audacious! A very important part of this Rule of Law goes straight back to the Peace of the King: the state has a monopoly on violence. Nobody gets to commit violence except when authorized by the government. Cops, soldiers, secret service... they can do it; you can\'t. In return, the state will step in and make things right(ish) by punishing the people who need punishing (on your behalf, sort of), either by dishing out violence (e.g., capital punishment or, in the past, beatings, etc.) or collecting fines (this is another thousand-year-old legal innovation that transformed the world). Bizarrely, *you don\'t get the money* from such fines... they go to the government. What a world we live in.\n\nThere have always been people (entire surviving subcultures, really) in England and the US who don\'t really buy this. They want to have the right to be violent on *their* terms, when *they* want to, and consider government punishment for this to be oppression. They especially want to have the right to take vengeance when they are wronged. This is a very, very old idea, and (see above) it can have disastrous social consequences. But it\'s never really gone away. How many cop movies have the protagonist committing unlawful vengeance while his cop buddies turn a blind eye? How many action heroes decide they have to "take the law into their own hands?"\n\nTrump, since the beginning of his candidacy, has openly appealed to this parallel value system in America. He models vindictiveness (i.e., vengeance) on an almost daily basis. He retaliates. He punishes. And he\'s not doing it on behalf of some conceptual "government" or some abstract "America," he\'s doing on his own behalf. He retaliates for every slight, perceived or real, against himself. He lets no insult go unanswered. He retaliates to the extent he is able, whether that is just verbally lashing out or threatening careers, lives, and livelihoods. He doesn\'t let things go. He holds grudges. He\'s a one-man rolling ball of blood feuds, with the tallies constantly updating in his head.\n\nAnd he\'s all about the "honor." You don\'t have to actually harm Trump to incur his vindictive stankeye; you just have to insult him. Give him insufficient "respect." Fail to celebrate him sufficiently. I think this fits with his personality, of course; it\'s not just a political act. But it is *also* a political act. \n\nTrump works every day to be something other than an American president; he works to be a medieval warlord. His core followers eat it up, so he makes sure to give them lots of it. He never lets the public see him back down... from *anything*. Although he is clearly weak in various political, personal, and psychological ways, he never shows the kind of weakness that loses staredowns in locker rooms. He pushes, and he never gets pushed back; if he does, he clobbers until the other guy doesn\'t get up. \n\nHis core supporters eat this up like cake for breakfast. I think it goes without saying that, left unchecked, this will destroy America. England was destroyed, constantly and repeatedly, for centuries, until a painful, slow, gradual process created the rule of law. The rule of law saves us.\n\n*Edit (about 8 hours later)*: Heh heh. Watching the upvote count reverse and start to count downward, now that the Trump supporters got their notifications that someone on the interwebs had threatened their clan chief\'s honor.'

"As an Alaskan, this is seriously fucked.  Lisa won't vote for the GOP plan because it will make Alaskans *ON AVERAGE* have to pay over $10,000 more per household a year for their insurance *PREMIUMS*.  We have only one insurance provider on the exchange, and my bronze plan will go from $100 a month to $1,400 a month without subsidies, and that's before the $11,000 deductible ($5,500 each for my wife and I) and even after that it is 30*%* co-insurance for in network stuff and generic prescriptions.  Which means currently it's $12,200 for premiums and deductibles for us before insurance pays a cent.  That would rise to $27,800 before it pays a cent, per year.  Our entire income before taxes is about $48,000 and we have a mortgage, bills, property taxes, food, vehicle and home insurance, home security, etc to worry about.  I'm as liberal as they get, and I voted for Lisa, as did my wife, and we are not regretting our votes right now."

'>Conservative pundit Tomi Lahren admitted that she still benefits from a key feature of ObamaCare during a debate in which she blasted the healthcare plan.\nLahren said during a debate at Politicon Saturday with liberal comedian Chelsea Handler that she is on on her parents\' healthcare insurance. The ability to stay on your parents\' plan until 26 is a major aspect of the healthcare legislation.\n\nSo benefiting from a democrat that you have constantly criticized for being a shitty  president.\n\n>“Luckily, I am 24, so I am still on my parents’ plan,” Lahren said during the debate, drawing boos from the crowd, according to The Daily Beast.\nHandler defended Lahren for the comment. \n"Stop, she is being honest," Handler said, Variety reported.\nLahren still slammed ObamaCare as being in a “death spiral.” Extending insurance to older dependents is not typically targeted by conservatives who criticize ObamaCare for other factors such as the individual mandate to buy insurance.\n\nBeing honest? This isn\'t about honesty. It\'s the fact that she bitches and moans about Obamacare but she\'s leeching from it like every other conservative voter that voted for Trump.

"Comment from the article:\n\n>This is an annoying and misleading headline and lede. I think the problem lies with the AP, not TPM, but TPM should not credulously repeat this stuff or amplify it with this kind of headline.\n\n>The 8.8 million figure is signups on the FEDERAL exchange. That's today's news. States had a choice of whether to set up their own exchanges or participate in this federal exchange. Most of the big blue states (California, New York, Massachusetts, Maryland, Washington, etc.) chose to build their own exchanges. Thus, it's not surprising that 80% of enrollees on the FEDERAL exchange are from red states -- those are most of the states on the federal exchange! Now, to be sure, it's not a perfect correlation. A bunch of blue states are on the federal exchange (Oregon, Michigan, and more) and a number of smaller red states went ahead and built their own (specifically, Idaho, Mississippi, and Utah). But by and large, most of the states on the federal exchange tend to be red states. So this 80% number is 100% due to that fact. When the enrollment periods end on the state exchanges, we'll get a fuller picture of where all the Obamacare individual plan enrollees are. It will not be 80% in Trump states.\n\n>Part of why I find this SO annoying is that while there is not a strong correlation between being in a Trump state and enrolling on the Obamacare exchange, there IS a stronger red-blue correlation between who would be eligible for the Medicaid expansion if states would expand Medicaid (there are lots more poor people in some of the Trump states, who would be eligible for Medicaid if their state chose to participate in the expansion). That is an important story. You can't see the important stories if journalists who don't understand health policy are putting out stories like this one."
"Many people who vote republican are beyond words.

'Plans with a $10,000 deductible serve little purpose. There\'s a reason why they are referred to as "catastrophic coverage". It\'s only useful if you\'re footed a $60,000 Hospital bill from a car crash or something in which case you only pay $10,000.\n\nWhy am I saying this? B/c I\'ve seen too many people (on Facebook or Reddit) complain that Obamacare sucks because their deductible is through the roof.\n\nObamacare doesn\'t suck (necessarily). Your coverage sucks.'
"This will be the first year I don't take it.  Indiana keeps cutting subsidies and just basically refusing to participate as much as they can so the cheapest plan I can get is about 250 a month for a *7 thousand dollar* deductible.  The cheapest plan with a reasonable deductible ($1,500) is over 350 a month.  \n \nSo instead I'll be taking my barebones employer plan for about 120 a month and a 2500 dollar deductible.  It's a far cry from the ultra-sweet Bluecross plan I had back when the ACA first rolled out.  I was paying like 130 a month for a plan with an out of pocket maximum of about 750 dollars and a 250 dollar deductible.  For the first time in my life I had literally no worries about my health which has been a little shaky since I was a kid, and now I don't have that liberation any more.  Sure, the stress is much lower than not having insurance at all, but what good is insurance that basically doesn't even exist until I have already paid out thousands.\n\nHopefully we figure this shit out, soon."
'I had a glitch in created in my profile when I first started; took days to sort it out, all just before open enrollment. Apparently they expected a huge run on applicants, because the week before open enrollment they brought in a bunch of new workers. \n\nI finally got a silver plan that seems ok on the surface, waiting for my info packet. But there’s literally only one plan to choose from now, the other two companies withdrew after trump started raping the subsidies. And I am paying almost $100 more than the plan I originally wanted. \n\nI’m still fucked, just not as fucked as I could be. '
"Just so everyone is aware, I live in Mississippi. I'm 25, no kids, and making low income. \n\nBecause of this bullcrap state, even though I qualify for Obamacare, I was denied because Mississippi was one of the states that refused to expand services this year.\n\nThis is a screenshot of a part of the .pdf sent to me: https://imgur.com/a/VVZ3P (I know quality is bad)\n\nI hate my home."
'The market is in serious need of some fixes, but I do not see that happening until Trump is out of office and democrats take back control of all 3 branches of government. I imagine the exchanges will collapse by then, unfortunately. '
'Hahaha...Trump-fail. Cut the advertising and sign up budget by 90% and cut the enrollment time by half and you still can’t stop people from signing up. \n\nSo much “winning”'
'My premiums for my family are either $2000, $2500 or $3000 per month. I have 3 choices. That is not good. I take home 6k month. I am starting to freak out. We don’t even have any health problems. We are all healthy. This is in TN.'
"So i'm just plain dumb with insurance in general. Basically if I make $25k a year - I'm 31 - How the hell does one person pay $250-500 a month on healthcare? I won't even use it. My dental is like $10 a month and my eyes are like $5. \n\nWhere do I go for more help?"
"The real question: Will the head Turtle in the Senate pay attention and fix the ACA or will they continue to murder it and the equivalent number of US citizens that will die because they're too chicken-shit to face Darth Corporate? Inquiring minds want to know. Oh wait, they already tried to kill people by taking their healthcare away, they don't care about people without insurance. Medical experiments for the lot o' ya'!"
'Trump told me Obamacare was dead though.....'
"I'd love to enroll but I make about $550 every two weeks.  My lowest plan with expected low use (even though I kind of really need to use it right now) is $525 with a $6650 deductible.  It's ridiculous and there's no way I can afford that.  It's half my take home pay.  I am not eligible for Medicaid or any of the other secondary options in my state either.  So I'm screwed for another year and praying nothing happens or worsens with what may already be happening.  For $675 my deductible is a lot lower, but it's also $150 more when I would have problems even trying to justify $150 less.\n\nEdit:  Seems I was missing some tax credits for my income.  This is a lot more doable.  Coming in at $20 for a $400 deductible.  No dental, though, and the dental didn't seem worth it."
"I'll be cancelling my insurance after I get back from my trip. I'm a student, 26,  unemployed, in Texas. I did the application and the cheapest insurance plan I can get is the catastrophic plan for $290 a month next year. My current plan is a bronze plan for $188... yea... I was planning on cancelling, bt wanted to switch to a cheaper plan and calculate my budget with that... yea... I can't afford this."
'I wonder if it has to do with the scare that nobody is making any real moves on a healthcare answer and the scare of the big nasty fines is getting people to move... even though Trump apparently knocked the fines off with his own executive order... for next year...'

"It makes sense to cheer for this thing that she stood for. But this thing that she stood for is what the GOP hates; they've been unequivocal about that.\n\nWhy aren't more voters - and Collins herself - taking the next logical step, and realizing that the Republican party itself is awful, and it's not just this one bad decision?\n\nCollins was a willing part of the process that brought us to the brink. Her party will continue to try to destroy healthcare in America tomorrow, and the next day, and the next, and Collins still has an (R) next to her name. How much am I really supposed to respect this woman? How much _can_ I? One decent act still leaves her 99% in the red, and she'll go right back to voting the party line on God knows what tomorrow.\n\nIt's always important (and difficult) to remember just how fucking low the bar has been set for these incompetent fucking assholes. They collectively kill people _all the time._ They need to pay for that."
'I live in Massachusetts.\n\nI sent her and murkowski emails a couple of weeks ago asking g them to stick with their convictions and to keep being brave.\n\nSent a similar one to McCain the other day.\n\nMy older sister (67 or 68) confessed to my wife that she tweets Trump telling him how awful he is\n\n\nShe was surprised when I told her I send him tweets telling him to kill himself.\n\nIf only.'
'And yet...it was a terrible bill, the CBO scored it as such: millions would have lost coverage. Obamacare is a mess: it was suppose to be built upon, not repealed or picked apart, piece by piece.'

"Since Charlie Gard lost his life because his government wouldn't allow him to go to the US, who was offering a chance to live, no, you don't get to say that's not a valid point. Healthcare has never really been in the free market in modern times, due to the health insurance scam, which won't change Uber Obama, it will only get worse. Let us pay for healthcare the same way we pay for flat screen TVs, via competition that brings down the cost of the phone to."

'My sister was just diagnosed with MS a month ago. She was told yesterday her policy will be dropped as a result of this move. So now she can only afford to let her condition worsen until she has to be admitted to a hospital. Can somebody explain how this saves money,when we need to pay for her inevitable emergency room visit anyway? Forgetting the impact on her quality of life, and inability to work without treatment. Such a short sighted move.'
'No doubt, stocks he and his family shorted before the speech. But I digress. If he wants the insurance companies to do badly, then move to a single payer system ~~where they\'ll all be out of the health market~~. ("Plunge" = 3%, btw) [EDIT: fixed per comments below]'
"I hate him so much. My family's premiums and costs will go up and I'm 4 months pregnant. He's evil. "
"Trump is such a disaster. He's a disaster on an unprecedented level. He's narcissistic, stupid, vindictive, and dangerous. He has no plan. He has no strategy. He's just a wrecking ball. And while some people say we'll recover, as we did from Nixon and Bush, we won't. No, we won't recover, because everything is relative, as Einstein said. So what's happening is the rest of the world is moving forward while we try and go back in time. \n\nOur education is failing, our infrastructure is aging, and our thought leadership is slipping. Twenty years from now the US will not be the best place to work and live, and with that we'll have massive brain drain, if it isn't already happening. America is about to take a back seat to the rest of the world. "
"This isn't about you or me, or whether or not Trump cares about healthcare in the US. THIS is all about his boner for Obama. Trump is a man who by all accounts likely never had the approval of his father craves adulation, and since there is a large portion of the population who will not give him that kind of adulation they had for Obama he will try and hurt them in any way they can. One of those ways is undoing everything Obama did whether it is the right thing to do or not, and as a bonus its a dog whistle to his most rabid sycophants. The horrifying part is he cares so little for the effect his actions have on people he as long as he gets what HE wants out of it is the thought of what will happen if we ever get to the point where nuclear war is a possibility knowing HE will be ushered off to some bunker and likely survive.

"What people don't understand is that by cutting these subsidies for the lowest income group, it's the middle class (silver plan upwards) who are going to take the kick in the nuts and end up with massive premium rises ; \n\nTe law states that the low income qualified plans and discounts the subsidies gave, still have to be honored so the insurance companies are going to have to pay for this by jacking up all the plans above this. \n\nTrump just fucked the middle class, in one dumb stroke of the pen."
"I'm going to die because of the Orange asshole's hate of a black man. "
'This fucker has, with the stroke of a pen, killed more people than 9/11'
'The sad, sad truth is right now his supporters are thinking..."Ya! Fuck those mooching welfare queens." Not understanding that low income likelyeans them.'

"Dear insurance companies:\n\nIf you don't like Obamacare being fucked with like a political football, maybe you shouldn't have spent the last 8 years politicizing your business by blaming every rate hike, negative policy change, and reimbursement cut on Obamacare."
'I thought we all hated insurance companies and wanted a single payer system?'
"This isn't going to immediately hurt the low-income people receiving subsidies to purchase ACA plans. It's going to hurt the people that were constantly interviewed on Fox news lamenting their skyrocketing premiums under the ACA. The middle class folks who make too much to qualify for subsidies and have to buy plans on the individual market, paying the full premiums of the enhanced coverage plans mandated by the ACA. They did see large premium increases under the ACA...and this is going to jack those premiums up another 20-25%. The very people who wanted the ACA repealed by Trump are instead getting screwed. The irony of him boasting about fucking over the GOP's poster children for ACA repeal is so, so delicious.\n\nThe only thing that would make it better is if they were smart enough to realize what's actually happening. They might, bills are one thing that even the densest of Trump supporters can understand."
'Good. Fuck the insurance companies. Why the fuck did all their stock go up 500%+ after Obamacare? It was fucking robbery. '
"I'm seriously surprised people can't understand why we don't like for-profit healthcare yet think this is a disaster. It will heavily damage the economy. That's a bad and avoidable thing too.\n\nStop being fucking childish so you have an argument."
"Quite an accomplishment to throw the insurance marketplace into a tailspin. It's nice that this fucker only thinks about his ego and has absolutely no regard for the people who are sick and actually NEED the insurance to live. That's what happens when you were born with a silver spoon up your ass and are used to people kowtowing and toadying to your every whim. The winning never stops, no brakes on this train."

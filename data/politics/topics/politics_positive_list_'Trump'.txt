'Is this something an innocent person would do?'
"Four people told the NYT about this. Mueller learnt about this when he was interviewing people a few months ago. So you have probably at least four peopel on record for the special counsel investigation that Trump tried to stop it. I really don't see how he isn't going to get an obstruction of justice charge. "
'> The president also said Mr. Mueller could not be impartial because he had most recently worked for the law firm that previously represented the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\n\nLOLOL, he was concerned Mueller would be too kind to Jared. '
'Please make your voices are heard in the elections in November.\n'
'Dear Agent Orange,\n\nYou FUCKED.\n\nSincerely, \n\nAmerican Democracy '
'Oh shit, this is huge. More evidence for that obstruction of justice charge. '
'The State of the Union address is this Tuesday. It would be amazing if Mueller dropped Obstruction charges on Trump right in the middle of the SOTU address, or right before Trump was scheduled to begin.'
"Here's a headline from the Washington Post on June 14:\n\n> [Special counsel is investigating Trump for possible obstruction of justice, officials say](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/special-counsel-is-investigating-trump-for-possible-obstruction-of-justice/2017/06/14/9ce02506-5131-11e7-b064-828ba60fbb98_story.html?utm_term=.ff4c70809dc8)\n\nAnd here's a tweet from Donald Trump on June 15:\n\n> [You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history - led by some very bad and conflicted people! #MAGA](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/875321478849363968)\n\n"
'And he payed off a porn star he was committing adultery with four months after he had a child with his wife.\n\nAnd he openly sympathizes with Nazis.\n\nAnd he backed a pedophile candidate.\n\nAnd he pals around with dictators. \n\nAnd he is on tape bragging about sexual assault. \n\nAnd he calls other countries “shitholes”.\n\nAnd he still has the support of the GOP.\n\nWho cares how many upvotes or downvotes this gets, just vote during elections.'
'To the historians doing their PhD in 2039 reading this: keep up the good work! I believe in you!'
'> The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has subpoenaed the Trump Organization to turn over documents, including some related to Russia, according to two people briefed on the matter. The order is the first known time that the special counsel demanded documents directly related to President Trump’s businesses, bringing the investigation closer to the president.\n\nSo about that red line...'
"He is subpoenaing then instead of asking because if he subpoenas and trump fires him, it won't matter. The subpoena would still stand and Trump would still have to provide them. 99% sure he is going to claim executive privilege and say he doesn't have to provide docs (which is horseshit of course and if we really want to go to the precedent Nixon was subpoenaed for docs and had to comply - thanks for all the precedent republicans!).\n\nEdit: I should have been clearer - I don't think executive privielge applies at all. That's why I called it horseshit in my original comment. I just think the stable genius will try to use it because he's desperate and stupid. We are talking about these people: Sessions who used executive privilege for things that happened before trump was elected claiming that he might use it sometime in the future so I can't answer your question, Trump jr who tried to use attorney client communications confidentiality when talking to Non-attorneys. These people are stupid and desperate and will claim whatever defense they can whether applicable or not. That's what I was saying. And even if they claim it, which they will, Nixon already set a precedent where a president must comply with at least a doc request subpoena. "
'>"Mr. Mueller could run afoul of a red line the president has warned him not to cross. Though it is not clear how much of the subpoena is related to Mr. Trump’s business beyond ties to Russia, Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times in July that the special counsel would be crossing a “red line” if he looked into his family’s finances beyond any relationship with Russia. The president declined to say how he would respond if he concluded that the special counsel had crossed that line."\n\n"Try me." - Mueller'
'Here we go... \n\n If you arent guilty, turn it all over NOW.\n'
"I am expecting this to top r/All by the time I leave work. Don't let me down.\n\nEDIT: Well that was fast. With 90 minutes to spare!"
"Weird that this story would break the same day Trump actually said things that make it sound like he's willing to hold Russian accountable for something.\n\nHow odd.\n\nThe timing, it's just strange.\n\nOh. Wait. I get it now."
'No wonder the bots were so active today.'
'> The Trump Organization has said that it never had real estate holdings in Russia, but witnesses recently interviewed by Mr. Mueller have been asked about a possible real estate deal in Moscow. In 2015, a longtime business associate of Mr. Trump’s emailed Mr. Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen at his Trump Organization account claiming he had ties to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and said that building a Trump Tower in Moscow would help Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign.\n\n> Mr. Trump signed a nonbinding “letter of intent” for the project in 2015 and discussed it three times with Mr. Cohen.\n\n[CNN last year obtained documents detailing this plan.](https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/08/politics/document-trump-tower-moscow/index.html).  Further info at [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/28/us/politics/trump-tower-putin-felix-sater.html) about Sater\'s involvement.\n\nFrom the CNN report, don\'t forget Ivanka is wrapped up in that deal.\n\n> Trump\'s company was explicitly given the option to "brand any or all portion of the spa or fitness facilities as **\'The Spa by Ivanka Trump\'** or similar brand," according to the document. And if they did name it after Trump\'s daughter, then Ivanka or her designee would be given "sole and absolute discretion" to approve "all interior design elements of the spa or fitness facilities," the document says.\n\n-\n\nBack to the NYT report:\n\n> The breadth of the subpoena was not clear, nor was it clear why Mr. Mueller issued it instead of simply asking for the documents from the company, an umbrella organization that oversees Mr. Trump’s business ventures. \n\nProbably because he knew they would just say no.'
"Translation: Mueller has evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, and is politely giving them an opportunity to fuck themselves over.\n\nhe doesn't subpoena something unless he ~~already knows~~ could prove it a month ago.\n\nedit:\n\n> Mr. Mueller appears to be broadening his investigation to examine the role foreign money may have played in funding Mr. Trump’s political activities.\n\nOh, that's a paddlin.'"
"Don't forget the timing of this drop - the WH is about to hold it's daily briefing at 1430 (20 min from now). SHS, in all honestly, might straight up cancel today's briefing.\n\nNYT, trolling the Trump administration since 1/20/2017."
'This is probably related to the fact that the Trump organization was actively negotiating with a sanctioned Russian bank during the 2015 Primary campaign for financing on a Trump Tower Moscow.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-business-sought-deal-on-a-trump-tower-in-moscow-while-he-ran-for-president/2017/08/27/d6e95114-8b65-11e7-91d5-ab4e4bb76a3a_story.html?utm_term=.a361b56d8392'
'GOP: "As far as were concerned, the Investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to interfere with the election is over."\n\nMueller: "That\'s cool. Here\'s some subpoenas"\n\nEDIT: goddamnit'
'EXCELLENT timing, with rumors swirling about his firing.  This makes it difficult.\n\nxoxox Mueller.'
'In the subpoena, **delivered in recent weeks**, Mr. Mueller ordered the Trump Organization to hand over all documents related to Russia and other topics he is investigating, the people said.\n\n'
'Lordy, I hope there are documents '
'13 minute old article - 250 comments.\n\nThis gonna be good. '
"But the republican house committee said that the republican president was innocent. I mean, both Trump and Putin say there wasn't collusion, so clearly there was no collusion, right? \n\n"
'Particularly interesting that only “some documents” are related to Russia. Question being what else is he looking at?'
'> The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has subpoenaed the Trump Organization to turn over documents, including some related to Russia, according to two people briefed on the matter. The order is the first known time that the special counsel demanded documents directly related to President Trump’s businesses, bringing the investigation closer to the president.\n\n\n*Jaws theme song intensifies*'
"JUST WAIT ONE GOSH DARN MINUTE!  The Republican's came out and said just a couple days ago that their investigation cleared the Trump camp of all wrongdoing!  This is obviously a FBI witchhunt!\n\n**/s**"
'I think I speak for all Americans when I say this: \n\nFuck yeah, Mueller.'
"This is clearly just Mueller's way of getting at Hillary Clinton and John Podesta's emails. Pizzagate indictment coming soon! /s"
"Trump will fire Mueller, it's inevitable at this point. It's going to happen and it's going to happen soon. Republicans need as much time as they can get from now until the midterms to do damage control over the firing and pray that Russia can help them pull off another upset in Nov. If they don't kill this investigation it's game over for them. Get ready folks, our democracy is about to be tested like never before. "

'Prattling on about how your IQ is greater than everyone else\'s was something that made you look like a bullying, doddering idiot in middle school.

'Imagine if he scored between 50 and 70, and proved Tillerson correct with his "moron" assessment? \n\nWiki:\n\n*"Moron" was coined in 1910 by psychologist Henry H. Goddard[3] from the Ancient Greek word μωρός (moros), which meant "dull"[4] and used to describe a person with a mental age in adulthood of between 8 and 12 on the Binet scale.[5] It was once applied to people with an IQ of 51–70, being superior in one degree to "imbecile" (IQ of 26–50) and superior in two degrees to "idiot" (IQ of 0–25). The word moron, along with others including, "idiotic", "imbecilic", "stupid", and "feeble-minded", was formerly considered a valid descriptor in the psychological community, but it is now deprecated in use by psychologists.*'
"Ha. Trump is outplayed again at every turn. Somehow, I don't think Trump is going to let Mensa (a group of very bright people) evaluate him. "
'"I have an almost perfect IQ score of 96 out of 100. Take that Rex!" -- The Dotard'
"I mean - this last year has to be some kind of joke, right?  We're living in some sort of global prank, right? "
'The educated know that the IQ test is not a reliable measure of intelligence and for its uses, is still a pretty flawed test.  Challenging someone to an IQ test contest when they call you dumb sounds like the sort of thing a moron would do.'
'To be fair, I wanna know which one has a high IQ to understand Rick and Morty more.'
'I’d like to see this on TV. Make it accessible to everyone so that we can see the level of dotard the dotard actually is. '
'How you like dem apples Donnie?'
'Mensa: "All right, here are your exams. Fifty questions. True or false."\n\nDonald: "True"\n\nMensa: "Mr President, I was just describing the test."\n\nDonald: "True."\n\nMensa: "Mr President, just take the test, and you\'ll do fine."\n\nDonald: "False"'
'Trump supporters, after the test:\n\n“What? Stupid MENSA libcucks! You can’t go by his actual answers! You have to go by what he REALLY MEANT! He’s too smart for the test!”'
'Can the proceeds support public education?'
"It boggles my mind that Trump just like still doesn't expect people to call his bluff. It's becoming an American past time at this point. "
'Trump will bail like he always bails.'
'Then air it via pay per view w/ all proceeds to help Puerto Rico!'
'This presidency is such a joke. '
'If they would show them working through the problems on the test I would pay to watch. It could be the best pay-per-view event in years!'
"I'd like to see Donald prove he isn't illiterate."
'When did Mensa start hosting the special olympics?'
"You guys aren't considering the reality of what would happen in this instance. You see Rex would throw his test a bit and score like a 70 just so that trump has a prayer of beating him. Then trump goes and lands like a 69 and proceeds to make a sex joke about his score."
"I really hope that something will come out of this but let's be real, Mr.  Trump knows he's not gonna score 3 digits"
'I would pay to see this.  How about they do it as a pay per view event and donate the proceeds to Puerto Rican relief efforts?'
'he needs an EQ test honestly'
"Trump: It's just a liddle test, I'll do fine"
"Either put up or shut up, Trump. Of course there's a near 100% chance he'll do neither though..."
"The Democrats achieved the impossible. They won a Senate Seat in ALABAMA. 2018 is next, and they have a chance. Democrats have a chance in every single state where there is an election. \n\nDonald Trump went all out supporting Moore.

"Hey, GOP politicians that had Moore's back at the eleventh hour: was it worth it to support a child predator and lose anyway? Please, tell me how you feel."
"Well, consider me just a little bit less cynical. I have been so disappointed in everything recently that I bought shares on PredictIt for Roy Moore winning the race at the height of his scandals, assuming that Trump would yell fake news, the accusations would get swept under the rug and Moore would ease into a landslide victory. I've never been so happy to be proven wrong. It turns out, we can be better. And we just got a little better. "
"I don't think I've ever cheered a U.S senate result before...\n\n..I'm British "
'Why did Roy Moore get 2nd place in the election?\n\nBecause he likes to come in a little behind.'
"I'm literally in tears. I don't know what's happening. I can't describe or explain my feelings. I never imagined in a million years that me, as as an American of Arab descent, not currently even living in the United States, would be up before the sun rises, with an exam to take in about 8 hours, crying (tears of joy) over the results of an election taking place in...Alabama. \n\nThere is hope for our democracy after all.\n\nWhat. A. Time. To. Be. Alive. "
'Congrats Alabama. You kept a pedophile out of office.'

'There is hope after all'
'Lets just make this clear folks.\n\nTrump endorsed Ed Gillespie in the Virginia gubernatorial election.

'Well Tammy, how do you really feel?\n\nWhat an excellent slam.  That one is going to leave a mark.'

'WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE:\n\n\n> “I have been advised by federal prosecutors that the New York action is, in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.”'
'The F.B.I. on Monday raided the office of President Trump’s longtime personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, seizing records related to several topics **including payments to a pornographic-film actress.**\n\nFederal prosecutors in Manhattan obtained the search warrant after receiving a referral from the special counsel, **Robert S. Mueller III**, according to Mr. Cohen’s lawyer, who called the search “completely inappropriate and unnecessary.” The search does not appear to be directly related to Mr. Mueller’s investigation, but likely resulted from information he had uncovered and gave to prosecutors in New York.\n\nThe payments to Ms. Clifford are only one of many topics being investigated, according to a person briefed on the search. The F.B.I. also **seized emails, tax documents and business records**, the person said.'
'For those wanting to know just how major these raids are:\n\n>2. Moreover, it\'s not just that the office thought that there was enough for a search warrant. They thought there was enough for a search warrant of an attorney\'s office for that attorney\'s client communications. That\'s a very fraught and extraordinary move that requires multiple levels of authorization within the Department of Justice. The U.S. Attorney\'s Manual — at Section 9-13.320 — contains the relevant policies and procedures. The highlights:\n\n>The feds are only supposed to raid a law firm if less intrusive measures won\'t work. As the USAM puts it:\n\n>In order to avoid impinging on valid attorney-client relationships, prosecutors are expected to take the least intrusive approach consistent with vigorous and effective law enforcement when evidence is sought from an attorney actively engaged in the practice of law. Consideration should be given to obtaining information from other sources or through the use of a subpoena, unless such efforts could compromise the criminal investigation or prosecution, or could result in the obstruction or destruction of evidence, or would otherwise be ineffective.\n\n>Such a search requires high-level approval. The USAM requires such a search warrant to be approved by the U.S. Attorney — the head of the office, a Presidential appointee — and requires "consultation" with the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. This is not a couple of rogue AUSAs sneaking in a warrant.\n\n[Source](https://www.popehat.com/2018/04/09/the-search-of-trump-lawyer-michael-cohens-office-what-we-can-infer-immediately/)'

'My best guess is that in the course of his investigation, Mueller uncovered communications between Trump and Cohen indicating several financial crimes that probably have the resulting documentation. Mueller doesn\'t pursue them because they aren\'t related to Russia (campaign finance, money laundering being the leaders on the board in Vegas), but passes them along to SDNY for investigation. \n\nRather than risk Cohen destroying the documentation of the illicit actions, they raid his office and hotel to make sure they get everything they need.\n\nMore importantly, the F.B.I. raided the "home" and office of the President\'s personal attorney.

'Article\n\nA lawyer for President Donald Trump arranged a $130,000 payment to a former adult-film star a month before the 2016 election as part of an agreement that precluded her from publicly discussing an alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMichael Cohen, who spent nearly a decade as a top attorney at the Trump Organization, arranged payment to the woman, Stephanie Clifford, in October 2016 after her lawyer negotiated the nondisclosure agreement with Mr. Cohen, these people said.\n\nMs. Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels, has privately alleged the encounter with Mr. Trump took place after they met at a July 2006 celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, these people said. Mr. Trump married Melania Trump in 2005.\n\nMr. Trump faced other allegations during his campaign of inappropriate behavior with women, and vehemently denied them. In this matter, there is no allegation of a nonconsensual interaction.\n\n“These are old, recycled reports, which were published and strongly denied prior to the election,” a White House official said, responding to the allegation of a sexual encounter involving Mr. Trump and Ms. Clifford. The official declined to respond to questions about an agreement with Ms. Clifford. It isn’t known whether Mr. Trump was aware of any agreement or payment involving her.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Cohen didn’t address the $130,000 payment but said of the alleged sexual encounter that “President Trump once again vehemently denies any such occurrence as has Ms. Daniels.”\n\n\nMr. Cohen added in the statement, addressed to The Wall Street Journal: “This is now the second time that you are raising outlandish allegations against my client. You have attempted to perpetuate this false narrative for over a year; a narrative that has been consistently denied by all parties since at least 2011.”\n\nThe Journal previously reported that Ms. Clifford, 38 years old, had been in talks with ABC’s “Good Morning America” in the fall of 2016 about an appearance to discuss Mr. Trump, according to people familiar with the matter. In that article, the Journal reported the company that owns the National Enquirer agreed to pay $150,000 to a former Playboy centerfold model three months before the election for her story of an affair a decade earlier with the Republican presidential nominee, which the tabloid newspaper didn’t publish. The company said she was paid to write fitness columns and appear on magazine covers.\n\nMr. Cohen also sent a two-paragraph statement by email addressed “TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN” and signed by “Stormy Daniels” denying that she had a “sexual and/or romantic affair” with Mr. Trump.\n\n“Rumors that I have received hush money from Donald Trump are completely false,” the statement said.\n\nMs. Clifford didn’t respond to multiple emails seeking comment.\n\nAfter the agreement, Ms. Clifford’s camp complained the payment wasn’t being made quickly enough and threatened to cancel the deal, some of the people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe payment was made to Ms. Clifford through her lawyer in the matter, Keith Davidson, with funds sent to Mr. Davidson’s client-trust account at City National Bank in Los Angeles, according to the people.\n\n“I previously represented Ms. Daniels,” Mr. Davidson said, referring to Ms. Clifford’s stage name. “Attorney-client privilege prohibits me from commenting on my clients’ legal matters.”\n\nA spokeswoman for City National Bank declined to comment.\n\nThe agreement with Ms. Clifford came as the Trump campaign confronted allegations from numerous women who described unwanted sexual advances and alleged assaults by Mr. Trump.\n\nIn October 2016, the Washington Post published a videotape made, but never aired, by NBC’s “Access Hollywood” in which Mr. Trump spoke of groping women.\n\n\nMr. Trump denied all allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and apologized at the time for his remarks on the tape, calling them locker-room banter.\n\nMr. Cohen worked at the Trump Organization from 2007 until after the election. As Mr. Trump took office, Mr. Cohen said he would work in private practice and act as Mr. Trump’s personal attorney. “I am the fix-it guy,” he said in an interview in January 2017 before Mr. Trump’s inauguration.\n\nMs. Clifford has appeared in about 150 adult films, and was considered among the industry’s biggest stars when the then-27-year-old met Mr. Trump at the American Century Championship in 2006, held at Edgewood Tahoe golf course in Nevada.\n\nAnother adult-film star, Jessica Drake, later alleged in an October 2016 news conference that Mr. Trump kissed her and two other women without permission in a hotel suite after the same 2006 golf event.\n\n“I did not sign [a nondisclosure agreement], nor have I received any money for coming forward,” Ms. Drake said this week in an emailed statement. “I spoke out because it was the right thing to do.”\n\nA White House official responded to questions about Ms. Drake by referring to a previous statement by the Trump campaign, which called her account “totally false and ridiculous.”'

It isn’t known whether Mr. Trump was aware of any agreement or payment involving her.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Cohen didn’t address the $130,000 payment but said of the alleged sexual encounter that “President Trump once again vehemently denies any such occurrence as has Ms. Daniels.”\n\nMr. Cohen added in the statement, addressed to The Wall Street Journal: “This is now the second time that you are raising outlandish allegations against my client. You have attempted to perpetuate this false narrative for over a year; a narrative that has been consistently denied by all parties since at least 2011.”\n\nThe Journal previously reported that Ms. Clifford, 38 years old, had been in talks with ABC’s “Good Morning America” in the fall of 2016 about an appearance to discuss Mr. Trump, according to people familiar with the matter. In that article, the Journal reported the company that owns the National Enquirer agreed to pay $150,000 to a former Playboy centerfold model three months before the election for her story of an affair a decade earlier with the Republican presidential nominee, which the tabloid newspaper didn’t publish. The company said she was paid to write fitness columns and appear on magazine covers.\n\nMr. Cohen also sent a two-paragraph statement by email addressed “TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN” and signed by “Stormy Daniels” denying that she had a “sexual and/or romantic affair” with Mr. Trump.\n\n“Rumors that I have received hush money from Donald Trump are completely false,” the statement said.\n\nMs. Clifford didn’t respond to multiple emails seeking comment.\n\nAfter the agreement, Ms. Clifford’s camp complained the payment wasn’t being made quickly enough and threatened to cancel the deal, some of the people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe payment was made to Ms. Clifford through her lawyer in the matter, Keith Davidson, with funds sent to Mr. Davidson’s client-trust account at City National Bank in Los Angeles, according to the people.\n\n“I previously represented Ms. Daniels,” Mr. Davidson said, referring to Ms. Clifford’s stage name. “Attorney-client privilege prohibits me from commenting on my clients’ legal matters.”\n\nA spokeswoman for City National Bank declined to comment.\n\nThe agreement with Ms. Clifford came as the Trump campaign confronted allegations from numerous women who described unwanted sexual advances and alleged assaults by Mr. Trump.\n\nIn October 2016, the Washington Post published a videotape made, but never aired, by NBC’s “Access Hollywood” in which Mr. Trump spoke of groping women.\n\nMr. Trump denied all allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and apologized at the time for his remarks on the tape, calling them locker-room banter.\n\nMr. Cohen worked at the Trump Organization from 2007 until after the election. As Mr. Trump took office, Mr. Cohen said he would work in private practice and act as Mr. Trump’s personal attorney. “I am the fix-it guy,” he said in an interview in January 2017 before Mr. Trump’s inauguration.\n\nMs. Clifford has appeared in about 150 adult films, and was considered among the industry’s biggest stars when the then-27-year-old met Mr. Trump at the American Century Championship in 2006, held at Edgewood Tahoe golf course in Nevada.\n\nAnother adult-film star, Jessica Drake, later alleged in an October 2016 news conference that Mr. Trump kissed her and two other women without permission in a hotel suite after the same 2006 golf event.\n\n“I did not sign [a nondisclosure agreement], nor have I received any money for coming forward,” Ms. Drake said this week in an emailed statement. “I spoke out because it was the right thing to do.”\n\nA White House official responded to questions about Ms. Drake by referring to a previous statement by the Trump campaign, which called her account “totally false and ridiculous.”\n\n—Alexandra Berzon contributed to this article.\n\n'

'"When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption **becomes known**, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history. You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America...America will triumph over you. "\n\nI have a feeling Brennan knows the truth.\n\nAnd I also have a feeling McCabe implied something similar last night: \n\n>"I have always prided myself on serving my country with distinction and integrity, and I always encouraged those around me to do the same. Just ask them. To have my career end in this way, and to be accused of lacking candor when at worst I was distracted in the midst of chaotic events, is incredibly disappointing and unfair. **But it will not erase the important work I was privileged to be a part of, the results of which will in the end be revealed for the country to see.** "\n\nTrump doing this to McCabe will likely end about as well as him firing Comey. \n\n\nedit : MAGA trolls are also out in full force I see. Have fun kids, as Brennan said America will win this one. Trump will go down. \n\nedit 2 : In light of this post getting popular let me showcase my favorite quote from Brennan during the early hearings on the Russia investigation for anyone who might have missed it : ["Frequently, individuals who go along a treasonous path” do not even realize they are along that path until it gets to be a bit too late"](https://twitter.com/braddjaffy/status/867038198219800576?lang=en)\n\nBrennan was also [personally involved in receiving Intel from allies about Trump campaign\'s communications with Russians](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/12/christopher-steele-the-man-behind-the-trump-dossier) : \n\n>Robert Hannigan, then the head of the U.K.’s intelligence service the G.C.H.Q., had recently flown to Washington and briefed the C.I.A.’s director, John Brennan, on a stream of illicit communications between Trump’s team and Moscow that had been intercepted. (**The content of these intercepts has not become public.**)\n\nedit 3 : This just in : [McCabe kept Memo\'s.](https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/975056224235458560)  I told you this would end as well as him firing Comey. \n'

'Brennan wins the Trump nose swatting contest, hands down. '
'As a german i have to say that your daily news about Trump and his team are more entertaining than watching Homeland our House of Cards.'
'It makes me so happy that his presidency has gone so horribly that all non-partisan history books will talk about how the 45th president of the United States was one of the worst president and most disliked of all time.  Likely will feature the impeachment chapter.  America is not happy right now and we’re more enabled to talk about it together via the internet than ever before.  There’s so many articles and discussions and analysis of Trump and i think future generations are going to be able to very clearly see how we ended up here and where this is going.'

They are smarter than you. \n\nTrump is going to do down in flames. \n\nAt the very best he can hope for is after the mid-terms and Republicans get destroyed, he will meekly finish his first term and not run for re-election. \n\nMy gut is that after the mid-terms, he will be looking down the barrel at a Democrat controlled House and Senate and realize he is fucked. \n\nAnd, rather than be impeached, he will just resign, a-la Nixon. My guess is mid-2019 he will resign."

If you look [here](https://www.factcheck.org/2017/06/timeline-russia-investigation/), you can see where from Aug. 14-17, Roger Stone communicated with Guccifer 2.0. This is some pretty huge news. \n\nEdit: This seems like an outline for where the investigation is going since the indictment specifically mentions a U.S. Congress candidate requesting access to the hacked information from Guccifer 2.0. AND the indictment also states that Guccifer communicated with U.S. Persons, not just a person, about the release of the stolen documents. '

'Not sure if anyone has reported on this yet, but there was a hidden bombshell in the indictment released today that is VERY interesting.\n\nThe Russians first started trying to hack Clinton\'s personal email server on July 27th. What else happened earlier that exact day?\n\nThat was the day Trump famously publicly called on the Russians to hack into Hillary\'s emails and find what he called the 33,000 missing emails.\n\nI thought that July 27th date seemed familiar, so I had to go back and check on it and sure enough. You heard it here first.\n\nI have a feeling this was a pretty clear signal being sent to Agent Orange by Mueller\'s team that Trump and his folks are likely the "un-indicted co-conspirators" mentioned in the indictment.

By 26 January (two weeks later), the U.S. military had 17,000 personnel in and around Haiti.\n\n[Operation Unified Response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Unified_Response)\n\nKeep in mind: Haiti is not part of the United States, we obviously had no advance warning of the earthquake, and the US was part of a much larger effort. We had tons of warning for Hurricane Maria, though. Here it is ten days later, and Trump has only sent a combined 10,000 troops to Puerto Rico **and** the Virgin Islands. I've seen reports that only half the troops have gone to Puerto Rico.\n\nMuch more could have been done a lot sooner."
"Something else to point out is the complicity of media like Fox News, who has near zero coverage of Puerto Rico, giving 45 all the cover he needs to paint this awful narrative that the residents are to blame for lack of relief.\n\nIt's bad enough his supporter believe what he says in the presence of facts.

'So this is more details on something we already knew: that Trump himself was involved in writing the response.\n\nFrom the [July 11 NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/us/politics/russia-trump.html):\n\n>The original statement, drafted aboard Air Force One by advisers and then **approved by Mr. Trump**, said only that the Russian lawyer had discussed adoption policy during the meeting, without mentioning that the meeting had been offered as a chance to provide information about Mrs. Clinton’s dealings with Russia.

"Most people agree politician corruption is unforgivable, but it doesn't bother many Trump supporters who are right wing authoritarians. It is because they have highly impaired thinking, which also make it very hard to logically convince them. Don't hold your breathe that they will regret their votes and vote him out in next election. The best we can do against RWAs is to fight against them in elections vigorously. \n\nRelevant quotes from [The Authoritarians](http://theauthoritarians.org/Downloads/TheAuthoritarians.pdf)  \n\n(from page 15)\n> But some people go way beyond the norm and submit to authority even when it is dishonest, corrupt, unfair and evil. We would expect authoritarian followers especially to submit to corrupt authorities in their lives: to believe them when there is little reason to do so, to trust them when huge grounds for suspicion exist, and to hold them blameless when they do something wrong.\n\n(from page 75)\n> But research reveals that authoritarian followers drive through life under the influence of impaired thinking a lot more than most people do, exhibiting sloppy reasoning, highly compartmentalized beliefs, double standards, hypocrisy, self-blindness, a profound ethnocentrism, and--to top it all off--a ferocious dogmatism that makes it unlikely anyone could ever change their minds with evidence or logic. These seven deadly shortfalls of authoritarian thinking eminently qualify them to follow a would be dictator. As Hitler is reported to have said,“What good fortune for those in power that people do not think.”\n\n(from internal page 246)\n> So what’s to be done right now? The social dominators and high RWAs\npresently marshaling their forces for the next election in your county, state and\ncountry, are perfectly entitled to do what they’re doing. They have the right to\norganize, they have the right to proselytize, they have the right to select and work for\ncandidates they like, they have the right to vote, they have the right to make sure folks\nwho agree with them also vote. Jerry Falwell has already declared, “We absolutely are\ngoing to deliver this nation back to God in 2008!” \n\n> If the people who are not social dominators and right-wing authoritarians want\nto have those same rights in the future, they, you, had better do those same things too,\nnow. You do have the right to remain silent, but you’ll do so at everyone’s peril. You\ncan’t sit these elections out and say “Politics is dirty; I’ll not be part of it,” or\n“Nothing can change the way things are done now.”The social dominators want you\nto be disgusted with politics, they want you to feel hopeless, they want you out of their\nway. They want democracy to fail, they want your freedoms stricken, they want\nequality destroyed as a value, they want to control everything and everybody, they\nwant it all. And they have an army of authoritarian followers marching with the\nmilitancy of “that old-time religion” on a crusade that will make it happen, if you let\nthem. "

">Ivanka Trump, who now works in her father’s administration, did not respond to questions sent to her personal email, chief of staff, and the White House. A spokesperson for her attorney wrote that Ivanka Trump did not know about the Trump Moscow project “until after a nonbinding letter of intent had been signed, never talked to anyone outside the Organization about the proposal, and, even internally, was only minimally involved. Her only role was limited to reminding Mr. Cohen that, should an actual deal come to fruition (which it did not) the project, like any other with the Trump name, conform with the highest design and architectural standards.”\n\n>**But emails and interviews suggest that her involvement ran deeper.**\n\nTheir first reaction to this news becoming public, was to lie to journalists about it.\n\nThat's not the sign of an innocent person."

"Major Bombshell:\n\n> **President Trump over the summer repeatedly urged senior Senate Republicans, including the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, to end the panel’s investigation into Russia’s interference** in the 2016 election, according to a half dozen lawmakers and aides. Mr. Trump’s requests were a highly unusual intervention from a president into a legislative inquiry involving his family and close aides.\n\n>Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, the intelligence committee chairman, said in an interview this week that Mr. Trump told him that he was eager to see an investigation that has overshadowed much of the first year of his presidency come to an end.\n\nThis isn't some anonymously sourced leak. **Senator Burr stated on the record** with the Times said that Trump pressured the senate to end the Russian Inquiry. Ladies and gentlemen, we have obstruction. I think Mueller will be very interested.\n\nEdit - I wanted to include my response to a question below:\n\nFUN FACT: Interfering with a Congressional Investigation can constitute [obstruction of justice](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL34303.pdf), see, e.g. [18 U.S.C. § 1505](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1505)\n\n>Whoever corruptly, or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication influences, obstructs, or impedes or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States, or the due and proper exercise of the power of inquiry under which any inquiry or investigation is being had by either House, or any committee of either House or any joint committee of the Congress—\n\nAlso:\n\n>Mr. Trump often vented to his own aides and even declared his innocence to virtual strangers he came across on his New Jersey golf course\n\nLike, wtf? They are just trying to play golf bro, leave them alone."
"> Mr. Trump’s requests of lawmakers to end the Senate investigation came during a period in the summer when the president was particularly consumed with Russia and openly raging at his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions, for recusing himself from any inquiries into Russian meddling in the election. **Mr. Trump often vented to his own aides and even declared his innocence to virtual strangers he came across on his New Jersey golf course.**\n  \nI'm enjoying picturing this"
"Hey Trump, good news! If you come testify to Mueller and the SIC it will end these investigations sooner!

Mr. Trump, he said, “at no point has attempted to apply undue influence on committee members’’\n\nI\'m getting really tired of these outright denials of reality being able to be used as a defense.  He literally did the thing Raj Shah is saying he did not do.  If Trump was not attempting to influence it, he would have uttered zero words on the topic.  Instead, he said, "I hope you can conclude this as quickly as possible", which coincidentally, is pretty fucking similar to what he said to Comey.\n\n> Mr. Burr said he did not feel pressured by the president’s appeal, portraying it as the action of someone who has “never been in government."\n\nThis doesn\'t matter at all, and Burr knows that.'

"Regardless of whether he asked them or not, it's what they've all wanted to do from the beginning. Just listen to some of the R questions that have been asked about Clinton rather than Comey's firing or Session's repeated perjuries. We need a record of every R with every time they could have done something good for the country and stand up to Trump so they can't try to get reelected when the inevitable inquiries start spitting out indictments like crazy."

Just like with Nunes' complete dud, the Democrat memo is much more powerful in the abstract than it'll probably be in reality. \n\nThe correct play would have been having Republicans hype up the Nunes memo and then for Trump to refuse to release it citing national security concerns. Trump gets to look presidential, innocent, and impartial, and the memo gets to continue to be hyped up by the Trump cultists without reality getting in the way. Instead, a complete nothingburger of a memo is hyped up to laughable extremes, Trump releases it despite the overwhelming concerns of his own intelligence agencies, it's an embarrassing dud that is widely debunked, and then Trump refuses to release the countermemo citing the exact same national security he didn't give a single shit about days earlier. In one fell swoop, Trump portrays himself as not caring about national security, obstructing justice, and having something to hide, and gives the Dems a pertinent talking point. He truly is a 'fucking moron'; imagine how fucked America would be if he wasn't.   "

It was only then that, after having declared to us on numerous occasions what a great honor it would be, in a pathetic attempt to save face, this dullard claimed he decided to decline on his own.\n\nWe would also like to make known our official Royal notice of the ongoing battle of wits between our former invitee and Chairman Kim of North Korea.  As originators of the English language, we wish it to be known that use of the term "rocket man" as a retort to "dotard" is utterly feeble and declare this round to be won by The Chairman.\n\nFurthermore, we also wish to remind the colonists that we are most displeased with your apparent inability to elect, shall we say, competent leaders and to manage your own affairs.

'Trump is not some weird anomaly somehow separate from Republican politics. His platform is standard Republican shit.\n\nHis demeanor is *an* issue, but it is not *the* issue. Do you think President Cruz, or President Huckabee, or President Carson, or President Jeb(!) Bush would be pursuing different policies? Because I don\'t. They\'d be going after the ACA, tax cuts for the wealthy, more deportations, restricted access to abortion, rolling back marriage rights, etc. etc. etc. They\'d avoid fights with Gold Star families, and they\'d avoid mocking North Korea on Twitter, and they\'d avoid the NFL bullshit. But as far as actual policy goes, there would be no difference whatsoever.\n\nPretending that there are "compromise solutions" between Republican and Democratic policies is not helpful, because the two parties don\'t have competing solutions, they have competing problems. Climate change is the best example. The Democrats want to protect the environment and fight climate change; Republicans don\'t see climate change as an issue at all and want to deregulate fossil fuel industries to increase profit margins. What\'s the "compromise solution" here? We tried cap-and-trade under Obama, originally a GOP position, and it was shouted down as socialism and "the government picking winners and losers."\n\nHealthcare went the same way. Democrats eventually settled on the ACA, repackaging a Heritage Foundation plan that acts more as a handout to insurance agencies instead of a functioning health care policy. But hard work and careful policy drafting got us something that sort of works. And what did we hear from the right? Nothing but death panels and "keep the government out of my medicare" idiocy.\n\nDemocrats want to fix problems, and the GOP wants to prevent them from fixing problems. There is no middle ground in that framework. If the Republicans want to come back to the table on cap-and-trade, or health care, or the war on drugs, or women\'s rights, or lgbt rights, then fine. But they need to come willing to work toward solutions rather than trying to light the table on fire.\n\nActing like this is a Trump-specific problem is a cop-out. Trump did not create the Republican party, and he didn\'t create the electorate that put him into power. They existed before him; he just fell neatly into place. He is not the entirety of the rot, just the exposed maggots.'

'Wait, were there actually people who thought Trump cared about Medicaid?'
"Surprise Trump supporters, Trump lied again!\n\nNot only does he not have a better, cheaper solution to ObamaCare, he's coming for your Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security."

'Great, I hope she get’s a lot of “likes” while our country goes into the shitter. '
'Trump supporters who just got their medicaid cut responded: "You shut up Pelosi! Shut up!" \n'
'Trump literally told his cult that he WILL lie to them if it plays well. They gobbled that dumbshot right up. '
"She should really just say, 'he is cutting Medicaid!!' It would be better to lead with the big guns and make them defend that position instead of he is cutting everything and medicaid!!"
'*As short a time ago as February, the Ministry of Plenty had issued a promise (a "categorical pledge" were the official words) that there would be no reduction of the chocolate ration during 1984. Actually, as Winston was aware, the chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the end of the present week. All that was needed was to substitute for the original promise a warning that it would probably be necessary to reduce the ration at some time in April.*'

Is it to influence his re-election? \n\nWhat benefit does all this have. Is this posted to convince people who liked him or were impartial of him to hate him? Is it to make liberals feel better? Is there any tangible gain?\n\nEvery day it’s the same thing. 1210 more days of this until the election?\n\nSo this is Reddit now.

"While this is still important, it isn't as damning as it might seem. \n\n94% of Dems responded unfit for office, while 16%of Reps did the same. Only a slight majority of independents (54%) said Trump was unfit. \n\nTo me, it seems that Dems and Reps responded in a predictable fashion, but the independents were way closer than I would have thought. \n\n"
'As an independent, he’s fine. '
"This is the same old propaganda using polling which can't be taken at face value. It's a good thing that Trump is in office and not Hillary Clinton."
'Well there also was a poll that said he was fit...... THE ELECTION lol. '
"97 percent of democrats say he is unfit(shocking!) while, 84 percent of republicans say he is fit, also shocking. This poll doesn't mean shit. "
"We needed a poll for this? The man is just a narcissistic idiot of a joke. Feels like watching him on his tv show years ago can tell you how much you DON'T want him near important decision making."

'Trump is meeting Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the moment, maybe he could ask him about how successful banning semi-automatic rifles can be.'
"Please. Melania Trump is an empty head who just wanted have a kid, never worry about money, and live the Lifestyle of the Rich & Famous. \n\nShe never wanted any of this. There's no standard to hold the bimbo to. She doesn't give a flying fuck about anything except the fact that her luxurious lifestyle is gone forever. She's trapped in a contractual relationship with the most hated man alive and is doing everything she can to stay the fuck out of the news. \n\nThe second she can pull it off, she's gonna divorce the orange sack of shit, grab as much of the remaining money she can get her hands on, and head the fuck back to Slovenia on the first private jet she can charter. \n\n "

"I'm sure that Melania has mentally checked out as First Lady already and I don't blame her. "
'Guys honestly, it has been 1 year. Has Melania done anything SIGNIFICANT to address cyber bullying? The only reason that was chosen as her cause was because she had to have something. What makes you think she will address it now? '

'"The white house is not a dump. Never said it." \n\nProceeds to leave for 17 days.'
"I'm all for the bashing of trump and his love of golfing on the job and using the presidency to generate money for his properties. But did anyone read the article?\n\n>The trip could partially be related to the fact that the government is replacing the heating and cooling system in the White House's West Wing, so everyone who works there will need to leave by the end of the week, according to the AP.\n\nThis may be more related to this, and less that he's going into hiding. Naturally hickabee couldn't give definitive answers "
'So... has there just been a soft military coup or what? Sending this moron to a 17 day vacation and letting the grown-ups be in charge for awhile seems like a great manipulative move to start to stabilize government and minimize Trump.'
"Politics aside, it's time for the USA to catch up to the rest of the world in holiday/vacation.   If the president can take 17 days in august, shouldn't every american worker be able to take at least that much time throughout the year?   I worked for O'Reilly auto parts corporate for 2 years.  They give literally **zero** paid time off for employees during their first year with the company.   I recently was on vacation with a college friend from spain, and he thought i was joking when i said I only get 2 weeks all year for holiday.   He said he and most everyone else in spain/france/portugal area of europe get 5-6 weeks of holiday.\n\nI realize I suppose that of all the problems in the USA this is not very high on the totem pole, but personally i think that vacation, maternity and paternity leave, and time off in general is a problem in the USA and there are plenty of studies to support that the time off doesn't only not hurt productivity but actually helps it"
'17 days? It sounds like he could be going away for a medical procedure that he is trying to hide. '
'lol I just saw a comic with John Kelly telling an aide, "Just keep him on the golf course!"\n\n'
'Great, 17 days of Trump not embarrassing us in front of world leaders. 17 days of not speaking in public. 17 days of not in Washington pushing stupid agendas. Depending on how much he tweets, he will basically be giving everyone a break from his antics. I wish he would just stay on the golf course until he is served impeachment papers'
'RUMINT says Trump had a very expensive and well featured medical facility secretly installed into his private club prior to this trip.\n\nI wonder procedure what takes 17 days to recover from. '

"Let' take a step back from the rhetoric. \n\nHe pledges millions to charities ... publicly ... but doesn't do what he pledged, so leaving him open to getting more attacks.\n\nDoes that make sense?"
"Just to clarify for everyone, the 25th amendment is for cases in which the President is unable to properly execute the office. In order to strip Trump's power under a 25th amendment invocation, the Vice President, half of the Trump-appointed executive department heads, 2/3 of the House, and 2/3 of the Senate would all have to be onboard. This makes it extremely unlikely to happen.\n\nAlso, it technically doesn't *remove* the President, just reassigns his powers and duties to the Vice President, with the intention of returning them to the President when/if he is able to execute the office again.\n\nSo in this scenario, Trump would still hold the title of President, though wouldn't have the powers and duties that come with it. However, he may retain his executive privilege and other presidential perks. The Constitution doesn't really detail the intricacies. But for him to be fully removed from the office, he would need to be impeached by 50% of the the House and convicted by 2/3 of the Senate.\n\nThat said, removal via impeachment is a *much* more likely scenario than a 25th amendment invocation, given the requirements for each.

The reporter's question was about if Putin wanted Trump and instructed officials to help him win. The edited version makes it sound like the reporter's question was continuing on what Putin was talking about, which was about interrogating Russian or US officers who did illegal things.

'Why is there always a negative spin on this sort of stuff?  Could have just said "Mexico offers aid to Puerto Rico" and leave it at that.  The only reason to throw shade at Trump in the headline is to make people more pissed off and divided.  Like he went all the way out to Puerto Rico and people are still saying he has no sympathy, even though he praised people there for their efforts in making the hurricane not nearly as bad as others in the past.  And right after he said "throwing the budget out of whack" he praised Puerto Rico and said that all of the deaths were terrible.  I\'m sure the "budget out of whack" comment was in reference to the three hurricanes that occurred in about a month\'s time.'

Now add to that coming from an impoverished village/town/city with little in the way of education and you have a huge hurdle.

Again.\n\nThis wouldn't be such a problem if this isn't my 5th year trying to work VA disability.   There were 2 years there I thought I didn't need it, after initial application denied, but, in hindsight, that was a mistake.  But the appeal finally moved to an interview last month after about 20 months waiting, unable to do anything else, since it's a queue.  Even then, the interviewer stated she didn't know how I had so much clear service-connected evidence, but still couldn't get through.  \n\nThis *is* VA disability, though.  You can roll a veteran in front of a board bedridden from an IED, the scars and burns still clearly present, and the board will still refuse to call it service-connected.\n\nTrump's not helping the problem.\n\nSome of us got lucky and came home in one piece.

Ending net neutrality so the cable companies and telecoms can charge us all more since the nation has been cable cutting. \n3. Pumping another 100 billion into military contractors' pockets.\n\nThey messed up their attempt to make healthcare more expensive (although ending the mandate, etc, will make it somewhat more expensive).\n\nNext up, try to make healthcare field more money by forcing old people to use healthcare less by raising medicare age. Then they'll tackle using tax dollars to help old people by making people work longer by raising Social Security retirement age. Finally, they want to cut labor costs, so they'll try to get people work for less money and benefits by siphoning money from the public sector which goes to union people. (They've largely defeated the unions in the private sphere, but those public sector workers with union contracts and benefits makes it harder to cut non-union private sector employees wages and benefits.)\n\nAnd, yes, these are really their aims.

Couple that with tearing down monuments erected before the grandparents of anybody offended were born, and we\'re setting a pretty awful Orwellian precedent. \n  \n**Edit:** I\'m not a white supremacist. I\'m a liberal, who was taught to live mindfully and in the moment as part of a coping mechanism to deal with stress. I still make knee-jerk emotional judgments like everybody else ever born, but I do my best to check myself. Robert E. Lee wrote against slavery, but defended the government of his state; it wasn\'t a decision he made easily. The people who fought the south, directly, were largely in favor of peaceful reconciliation after the war; it was distant politicians and easily-swayed public opinion which made this impossible. Lee had the respect of many people on either side of the line, before and after the conflict, but vindictiveness helps no-one. They even took his land to make Arlington cemetery -- only to have to pay restitution, because the land belonged to the family of his wife, who was descended from the family of George Washington\'s wife; Lee came to it by marriage. Vindictive, knee-jerk reactions that bit everyone in the ass.  \n  \nI don\'t approve of white supremacy, or of everyone else acting like white supremacists in their own turn.'

They look to it for leadership and, well...fucking governance. You know, upholding the law, safeguarding Americans - all of them, not just some of them. Making sure the populace has what it needs and that government systems are functioning and able to provide services and security.

This basically forces "sides" and forces some members of Congress to make a decision NOW. Here\'s why that\'s a problem:\n\n1.) It\'s a well known psychological effect that if you are shown information that is contradictory to your current beliefs, you will try to ignore or discount it. By forcing Republicans (some of whom may secretly be on the fence but not ready to publicly support) to decide on impeachment right now, they\'re less likely to accept additional information in the future that would otherwise warrant support for impeachment hearings.\n\n2.) Layering it on, forcing Republicans to make a *public* stand or statement on impeachment even further cements their resolve. This is why motivational coaches always tell people to publicly announce their intention to diet/work out/whatever because they will feel an implied social pressure to follow through. Turning NO votes YES and vice-versa is very difficult because they become public contradictions.\n\n3.) Forcing someone to take a stand in *opposition* to anything almost always amplifies the above effects -- tribal politics are vicious, and opposition elicits a strong emotional pairing.\n\nPolitics 101: Never force a vote until you know you have the votes.'

You see it in tax policy, in drug policy, in foreign policy; to punish those considered the "others" is even more important than your own benefit. It goes beyond greed and egoism even.

The president said he did not know where his personal attorney Michael Cohen got the sum of money.\n\nNBC tweet\nDuring an Air Force One trip back from an event in West Virginia, he told reporters they would have to ask Cohen about why the lawyer made the payment. Cohen has said the money came from his own pocket.\n\nCohen\'s action has prompted questions about possible campaign finance law violations.\n\nLast month, Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, sued Cohen to try to get released from a nondisclosure agreement she signed in October 2016.'

'I haven\'t had the opportunity to comment on something so juicy on #TrumpRussia in a while. \n\nWell ladies and gentlemen, the story arc continues. Manafort was wiretapped all along. Lets review why that might be bad for Manafort and most of all, Trump, shall we? \n\n1) [His buddy Firtash was also wiretapped, reportedly **thousands** of intercepts](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chicagoinc/ct-firtash-0917-chicago-inc-20170915-story.html)\n\n2) [This is likely why he got FBI raided, they knew he was lying.](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/09/politics/paul-manafort-search-fbi-russian-interference/index.html)\n\n3) Trump continued to talk to Manafort even into this year. AKA Trump is probably "incidentally collected" on tape. and if Mueller thinks that relevant to the investigation....tick tick tick.\n\n4) [This could help explain Trump\'s wiretapping claim, people in Trump Tower were wiretapped, not the location itself. Could also be a coincidence.](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/timeline-president-trumps-unsubstantiated-wiretapping-claims/story?id=46198888)\n\n5) [Mueller\'s team told Manafort to expect indictments.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/us/politics/mueller-russia-investigation.html) (I wonder why?)\n\n6) They managed to renew the FISA. What caused that is likely going to be key. Was it the investigation into the dossier? Was it intercepts of RU or someone else implicating Manafort involvement? Would need to be something solid for it to be renewed specifically for the RU interference in the election. \n\n7) Manafort also regularly talked to Pence. [“I think he’s weighing in on everything,” the former official said, “I think he still talks to Trump every day. I mean, Pence? That was all Manafort. Pence is on the phone with Manafort regularly.”"](http://www.thedailybeast.com/paul-manafort-is-back-and-advising-donald-trump-on-cabinet-picks)\n\n>Some of the intelligence collected includes communications that sparked concerns among investigators that Manafort had encouraged the Russians to help with the campaign\n\n>Manafort was ousted from the campaign in August. By then the FBI had noticed what counterintelligence agents thought was a series of odd connections between Trump associates and Russia\n\nFunny how that works huh? \n\nBack when [Page was found to be wiretapped](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/us/politics/carter-page-fisa-warrant-russia-trump.html?mcubz=0) I thought it was unlikely he was the only one. Now we have Manafort confirmed. Do we really think that is where the tapes end? I certainly don\'t. \n\n[My Wiki on TrumpRussia](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpInvestigation/wiki/doc) is a bit behind now (trying my best to get it caught up this week) but there\'s one thing that has continued to be true, which is everything tends to look worse for Trump and the rest of team treason as time goes on. Also the key people named in the dossier tend to continue to pop up in the investigation. They managed to renew the FISA\'s on Page and Manafort likely off the back of some of the investigation the FBI was doing into the dossier. \n\n'

'The New York Times story from November 1, 2016 (the day after their front page was covered with Hillary/Weiner email stories) looks worse and worse:\n\n[Investigating Donald Trump, F.B.I. Sees No Clear Link to Russia](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/fbi-russia-election-donald-trump.html?mcubz=0)\n\n>For much of the summer, the F.B.I. pursued a widening investigation into a Russian role in the American presidential campaign. Agents scrutinized advisers close to Donald J. Trump, looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures, searched for those involved in hacking the computers of Democrats, and even chased a lead — which they ultimately came to doubt — about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank.\n>\nLaw enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, F.B.I. and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump.\n\nEspecially this part about Manafort, which is now debunked by the CNN story:\n\n>At least one part of the investigation has involved Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman for much of the year. Mr. Manafort, a veteran Republican political strategist, has had extensive business ties in Russia and other former Soviet states, especially Ukraine, where he served as an adviser to that country’s ousted president, Viktor F. Yanukovych.\n\n>***But the focus in that case was on Mr. Manafort’s ties with a kleptocratic government in Ukraine — and whether he had declared the income in the United States — and not necessarily on any Russian influence over Mr. Trump’s campaign, one official said.***\n\nThe NYT got played by FBI agents, and they have yet to own up to it.'

'My in-laws have a retirement property in Puerto Rico, currently inhabited by their rental agent and his family because their own home was destroyed.\n\nThey have enough communication so they\'ve been able to receive an album of pictures and video; their place is pretty much trashed, along with everything around it.\n\nThe kicker is that they are also Trump voters and serious Fox News watchers. \n\nI have *no* earthly clue how they must be processing the reconciliation of Fox News talking about Hillary Clinton and Harvey Weinstein all the live long day with what they must be hearing from people they actually know in real life. \n\nIn my wildest dreams, they are finally waking the hell up. \n\nI can only hope. \n\nEDIT 12 hours later, because this post somehow took off when I was only waking up myself and giving minimal content:\n\nThis is an extension of something I shared this morning ... but basically, Puertorriqueños can\'t vote unless they have residency on the mainland, Trump had a failed golf course there, and they\'re not anyone his "base" cares about.\nPersonally, my guess is that it\'s the golf course. Trump had a bad experience there, and his whole game is revenge on those who have slighted him, or those he feels have not treated him properly.\nUnfortunately, this is now petty revenge on 3.5 million human beings.\nMy in-laws have had a retirement home in PR for the last 20 years. I\'ve been there many times with them, easily a dozen or more weeks over time. Probably several more times than that. I know where the local Walmart is, and the grocery store, and I know how to find my way to El Junque.\nMy in-laws themselves go 4-6 times a year, up until this past summer, and they had a massive family vacation scheduled in a few months. They\'re not going now.\nI consider them to be good people whom I love dearly. But they are Trump voters in a bubble. They watch Fox News.\nEarlier this spring I mentioned how I didn\'t think Trump was up to this job and my MIL said "well, you do know he\'s a billionaire, he didn\'t get there by not knowing what he\'s doing."\nI said, "but you can\'t run a country like a company ..."\nAnd then someone else immediately intervened to change the subject. We don\'t talk politics at the table on holidays, or, really, ever. They are a very loving family, but I guess have always been some exotic "hothouse" flower in their midst, being from California.\nI know they are getting updates from their rental agent, who is actually living in their home with his family because his own home was destroyed. The home flooded and many glass doors and windows are cracked and shattered (flying coconuts, no joke), no running water, and the surrounding gated community is crippled.\nI don\'t know how they are dealing with this because my husband says we shouldn\'t ask them, they will consider it my "piling on" in their time of uncertainty and loss. But they haven\'t said anything in 3 plus weeks.\nI do wonder how they are processing that their favorite, news source, Fox, is definitely not covering the extent of the unfolding mess.\nThey have to know that everything is, indeed, not fine at all.\nAt least I hope so, because in a repeat performance of last year, perhaps I don\'t know as much about the world or people I thought I knew, as much as I thought I did.\nAnd that\'s alternately both scary and depressing.\n\nAlso, although I have video and pictures to verify to any mod, I honestly think they could go both ways. It\'s a lot of open scape property damage ... taken by property manger and wife leisurely walking their dog. '

I'm prepared now and I live nowhere near any disaster areas(hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, Blizzards).   It's not expensive, and if those who have a little more prepare for an additional 2 people, people won't be asking why the federal govt can't perform miracles.  \n\nNow we're expected to take to word of a teachers union representative.

"What I find frustrating about this is how F'ing easy the physics of global warming is to understand. The Earth is basically just a big sphere in a vacuum with a light source. Because it's in a vacuum there's only one way to loose heat and that's radiative heat loss. Our current global temperature is where the balance lies between how much heat we get from the sun and how much is radiated away. Greenhouse gasses including CO2 are transparent to the higher frequency light coming from the Sun but opaque to the lower frequency light being radiated out into space as radiative heat. This is exactly the same way your body is transparent to X-Rays but opaque to normal light. \n\nThe experiment to show that CO2 traps more heat than normal air is incredibly easy and can be done yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwtt51gvaJQ \n\nOf course it gets more complicated when you get into the weeds such as the amount of light reflected from the Sun depending on the average albedo of the Earth which goes up when there is more ice covering the surface of the Earth, but any claim that Global warming isn't happening needs to come with a realistic proposal with a measured effect describing the counter mechanism to warming from the CO2 we are releasing.\n\n\n"

Millian said that the information provided to Trump had been “very helpful.”\n\n>Unbeknownst to Millian, however, his conversation was not confidential.

"Reading the article, it does not appear that there's any wrongdoing in this bit of the story, except perhaps by the aide who tried to set up the meetings. I'm glad to see that the rest of the campaign was smart enough to know that they shouldn't be having talks with Russian officials without US gov't consent.\n\nIn some ways, it makes it a little more confusing that Manafort would go to that meeting in June. He seems to understand the issue here, but not later? There is a difference between meeting with Putin directly and some Russian-connected business people though, so maybe that's where he drew the line."
"This is a strange story. It feels like this means something bigger to the authors than what's immediately presented here\n\nEdit: Given that this was a junior-sounding adviser, and we know more senior campaign officials did have contacts with Russia, does this signify that they wanted to keep these actions hidden except at certain levels/within certain groups of the campaign?"

I think they were doing very basic intelligence work: Who’s out there? Who’s willing to play ball? And how can we use them?”\n\nI think we know how the story will play out from here. White house and conservative media will look to this and say "see, the campaign didn\'t want to collude with Russia." Details will come out about more emails and more contacts which again the right wing media and the white house will either downplay as not a big deal or fake news. The full emails will be released to WAPO that will show willingness or setting up of collusion. '

"I'm by no means a Trump supporter, by if he did it for the right reasons, I commend him for skipping the event.\n\nI think he is aware of how he is perceived and how heavily scrutinized any and all of his actions would be if he decided to attend. Regardless of what he does or says, he is the ultimate distraction / sideshow. So in order to avoid stealing the spotlight from the honorees, he decided to not attend and avoid turning their night into a sensationalist headline about him.\n\nI don't know if that's the actual reason, but I can give him the benefit of the doubt."

We are grateful for this gesture\n\nHas a president ever been so publicly humiliated and despised by an entire nation before?

"It's hard to imagine Trump sitting through an event that would honor someone other than himself, without making some sort of spectacle."
"That's the funniest thing to happen this week.  \nHad I been drinking something i'd have spit it out. Bravo to the Kennedy Center people for that response. "

'Nice burn, Kennedy Center!'
"Trump doesn't care about the arts either, and probably doesn't even know the names of those being honored.\n\nHe's the biggest cultural buffoon we've ever had as President. Funny how he said we need to preserve history - the only time he cares about art is when it comes to Confederate statues!"
'Police? I just witnessed a very elegant fucking murder.'

'Where can we buy a Thank You for Not Attending card? Get on it hallmark.'
'That is some classy shade. '
"It's amazing what political bias will do. The same people who were dead sure Obama was going to 'take our guns' (even though he never said anything remotely like this) are completely OK with Trump saying “Take the guns first, go through due process second,”. \n\nRepublicans claim to be about free trade and helping businesses, but have no issue with Trump starting trade wars with pretty much *all* of our trading partners.\n"

"It's becoming very clear that Trump is going to make his base voters suffer and that they are going to love him for it.   I'm not American so I'm certainly not an expert on US history but with that said I always felt that part of what made America truly great was that it was this smoldering mess, full of tension and always changing (mostly for the better).  Generation by generation the casting off of the old ideas for modern / more informed and understanding ones.  Looking at America right now, as an  outsider, is frankly scary.   An unhinged superpower."

'Well we know who isn’t getting on Fox News again anytime soon. '
"Imagine how they'd react to Obama's wife doing softcore girl on girl glamour modelling. "

He shoulda gotten some of them in front of a camera so the world can see him with them in front of a camera.  It's important!!

The previously unreported inquiry marks the second proposal for a Trump-branded Moscow project that was delivered to the company during the presidential campaign and has since come to light.\n\n>The June 2016 email to Cohen about the economic conference came from Felix Sater, a Russian-born real estate developer and former Trump business associate. **Sater encouraged Cohen to attend the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, with Sater telling Cohen that he could be introduced to Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian prime minister, top financial leaders and perhaps to Putin, according to people familiar with the correspondence. At one point, Sater told Cohen that Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, could help arrange the discussions, according to a person familiar with the exchange.**\n\nWell that is interesting because President Trump's long time lawyer, Cohen, is also a very good friend of Felix Sater. This Washington Post article further corroborates this article by the NYT;\n\n[The New York Times - Trump Associate Boasted That Moscow Business Deal ‘Will Get Donald Elected’](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/28/us/politics/trump-tower-putin-felix-sater.html?mcubz=3)\n\n>**The associate, Felix Sater, wrote a series of emails to Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, in which he boasted about his ties to Mr. Putin.** He predicted that building a Trump Tower in Moscow would highlight Mr. Trump’s savvy negotiating skills and be a political boon to his candidacy.\n\n>**“Our boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it,” Mr. Sater wrote in an email. “I will get all of Putins team to buy in on this, I will manage this process.”**\n\n>Mr. Sater said it would be “pretty cool to get a USA President elected” and said he desired to be the ambassador to the Bahamas. “That my friend is the home run I want out of this,” he wrote.\n\n>Mr. Sater — a former F.B.I. informant who is famous for having once smashed a martini glass stem into another man’s face — has maintained a relationship with Mr. Cohen over the years. The two men have spent decades operating in the world of New York commercial real estate, where the sources of funding can be murky.\n\nWant to know something else very interesting? \n\n**Back in the 90s Felix Sater was caught up in a massive stock scam and flipped on mob families in New York. [Guess who flipped him? That's right, he's on Special Counsel Mueller's team - Andrew Weissmann](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/06/21/felix_sater_donald_trump_robert_mueller_and_andrew_weissmann.html)**\n\n>In 2007, the New York Times reported that he had been accused in 1998 of securities fraud in a massive stock-scam case involving a number of New York mob families. It was later revealed that Sater pleaded guilty in that 1998 case, but that his involvement in it was kept secret, because he became a witness for the government and reportedly continued as such until 2008. **Sater is known to have helped build cases against individuals involved in the stock scam** and reportedly also cooperated in a case that involved attempting to secure missiles that were being sold on the black market in Afghanistan.\n\n>...[T]he Bloomberg story mentions in passing: **Andrew Weissmann was one of the people who prosecuted the 1998 mob stock-scam case during which Felix Sater flipped.** The deal Sater got from federal prosecutors at the time was so good that lawyers representing victims of the underlying stock scam are still upset about it     \n"

'To me, one of the strongest indicators that there is something to this investigation is that we\'re just finding out about all of this now. If there were nothing to hide, Trump or someone who was on his team would have disclosed all of the many "previously undisclosed" meetings by now.'
'The same people who were foaming at the mouth to see Obama\'s birth certificate are now like.. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ "Who cares that Russia helped our current President sway our national election." This is a pretty simple example of how Republicans are completely ridiculous people. '
'This story feels like a Trump-team "leak" to try to control a story before the bigger revelations come out. \n\n-\n\nI think their intention was to be able to point to two Russian contacts and put their best story forward - "Cohen declined the invitation" and "the real estate proposal was rejected"; and use these revelations as signs of an empty witch hunt.\n\n-\n\nHowever, Cohen turned down the meeting "*citing the difficulty of attending so close to the GOP convention.*" This ignores that this event was already red-flagged: \n\n-\n\n> "following Russia’s incursion into Ukraine in 2014, the Obama administration actively discouraged American businesses from attending the event."\n\n-\n\nAs for Gordeev\'s Moscow residential real estate project - yes, the proposal was turned down... in favor of Sater\'s proposal for Trump Tower Moscow:\n\n-\n\n> Cohen informed Rtskhiladze in 2015 that the Trump company could not pursue the project because it was already committed to another developer in Russia — a reference to the proposal being guided by Sater.\n\n-\n\nAnyways, I seriously doubt that these are the only "unreported contacts" that we\'re yet to hear about...'

Bharara tweeted "It is neither normal nor advisable for Trump to personally interview candidates for US Attorney positions, especially the one in Manhattan."\n\nIn contrast, Trump appears to be trying to get personally involved in the nomination of federal attorneys in New York (where he has his residence and a lot of white collar crime occurs) and Washington D.C., the two most prominent locations where he himself might be in legal danger.

"> **Firm partners had chafed over Mr. Giuliani’s public comments about payments** that another of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, Michael D.

On Tuesday, a firm spokeswoman asked for more time to provide answers.**\n\nThe truth reveals itself...\n\nEd: Article has since been updated w/ Greenberg Traurig's official response.\n\n> The New York Times asked Greenberg Traurig about those remarks early this week.

"> “After recognizing that this work is all consuming and is lasting longer than initially anticipated, Rudy has determined it is best for him to resign,” said the firm’s chairman, Richard A. Rosenbaum.\n\nIt makes me wonder if Giuliani truly believed that he was going to be able to bring an end to this in a couple weeks. Did he actually believe there's no there there, and that this was all some sort of set up and he'd be able to come in, expose it for what it is, and then be done? If so, he's even stupider than his interviews would lead you to believe."
'"Resigns." \n\nJust like Bill O\'Reilly "resigned" from his talk show.\n\nJust like the Mooch "resigned."\n\nWe need a new word for "voluntarily quit working," because "resigns" just doesn\'t mean the same thing, anymore.\n\nAt least for Republicans.\n\nLike Tillerson "resigned."'
'So let me get this straight. Giuliani by trying to defend Donald Trump, ended up implicating his entire Law Firm?'
'So focused on the law he can’t go to his job... and practice law.\n\nThe guy is kept around for name recognition and because he knows folks in the FBI.'

'> But Mr. Giuliani has enjoyed the public-relations work he has been doing for Mr. Trump, according to three people who have spoken with him. Much like his client, the former mayor prefers being untethered, they said.\n\nIn other words, he missed the limelight and will do what he has to, no matter his principles or scruples.'

"GT is a prestigious firm. Let's be clear that reputable attorneys who are not looking to lose their license over unethical behavior do not behave like Cohen.

I wanted all to have health insurance but the red voters, who actually needed it the most and received the most handouts, didn't want that.\n\nSo screw'em.\n\nI'm sure they have long enough bootstraps out there somewhere to pull themselves up with on their own.

"Dear Conservatives,\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLiberals"
'And I’ll bet that 90 percent of them don’t think they are on Obamacare because they don’t know that Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act are the same thing. '
'So it looks like Trump was right - the people that used it did not like it. Pretty simple to work out why those states voted for him based on that one fact.'
'I swear the day he dies I will have the biggest party ever '
"So it's a shock that people that hated ACA voted for Trump? I had ACA  before my employer instituted health insurance that was god awful. \n\nPeople act like Obamacare was a great thing. It has fucking sucked for working poor. They pay premiums then have like a $6000 deductible, i.e. they have NO FUCKING CARE until they spend $6000 of their own money. And for someone that makes $20-30,000/year that's not likely. \n\nStop acting like these people screwed themselves. Ya ever think that maybe, just maybe, they didn't like ACA and that's why they voted for Trump???\n\nMaybe the other states didn't have to deal with the giant piece of garbage so they loved Hillary and the gift-to-the-insurance companies in ACA!"
'The rural county my parents retired to is largely Republican.  The county voted almost 80% in favor of Trump.  Meth and food stamps are rampant.  People boast about being on food stamps in public.  Still they voted against their interests.  '
"I know one, twenty eight years old. He's been on dialysis for about 5-6 years. He just got a transplant like two months ago, the other day I found they are expecting kid number eight.\n\nNeither he or his wife has ever had any kind of real job. They still have a trump sign and flag in their yard."
"So why do we help them? It's strange how hard Democrats work to help people who (honestly) don't want it.\n\n"
'Yeah it is no surprise that big cities with higher incomes are subsidizing those who vote against the policies that help them...'
'Gotta keep in mind. These guys and gals who are under the ACA, food stamps, welfare who are avid Trump supporters believe they are above others that are under the same programs. \n"Well I earned it" or some other excuse while their peers are the ones who "don\'t deserve it". They are just going through a tough time but believe once their guy is in office they will be in the upper class where they belong. \n'
'I\'m sorry, but I\'m little taken aback how the "shithole" comment has gained such notoriety while trump saying all Haitians have aids, slipped through the cracks. '
"Virtually all of the criticism of Trump has been that he's a morally bankrupt, vile, corrupt person.  While this is true, it doesn't really matter to the people who patronize his businesses.  The appeal to conscience is completely lost on them.\n\nBut branding his properties as shitholes goes against everything Trump and his patrons care most about: status and power.  The fact that the words came out of his mouth make the meme have a bit more force to it; in the mind of the viewer it's not an 'angry liberal' saying it... it's Trump himself.\n\nTanking his brand is the first step in eroding the support he's still getting from his base—people who don't care about the moral and ethical lines he's crossed.  Before the elections this November, *that* is the way you weaken his political power: by removing the mythology of wealth he has cultivated."

"Glad to see they aren't shying away from using the L word here. "
'They didn’t just deny it; they called the reports a “gross misrepresentation.” Turns out that even if we accept their version of events, Durbin’s version is at best a minor misquote. The message and sentiment are the same.\n\nCotton and Perdue are liars, just like the rest of them.'
"Tom Cotton does nothing as far as legislation or nothing to try to make people's lives better. He is just involved in every scandal going on in Washington. He is the Swamp Thing, I know Arkansas could do better. I expect my kids not to lie, Tom Cotton needs a time out."
'Remember guys, this is a party where the "moderates" such as Boehner, Cantor, and Chaffez left on their own accord or got primaried. This party is not a party, it\'s full of people willing to harm their own country for ignorant or possibly monetary gains. '
"As an Arkansan I'd really like to make him a 1 term senator. "
">Brick. Brick! He said BRICK shithouse. So that's actually a compliment.    \n    \n~ Cotton and Perdue, in their next iteration of this lie probably"
'Shame on both of them, especially Cotton. He is soiling the honor of the Armed forces that he likes to associate with so much. He is soiling the reputation of the US Senate. \n\nShame on you Cotton!'
"Trump is as subtle as a wrecking ball.  You don't try and get in front of that and expect it to go well for you personally."
'Did they actually recant and say they heard "shithouse" instead of "shithole", as if that somehow made it seem \'better\' for Trump?  Do these people have any integrity left?'
'GOP is such a traitorous party.   Always trying to divide than unite.'
"So, just another day in D.C. as they continue to normalize this behavior. What hold Trump has over these guys, I'm sure I don't know."
'I’m just so amazed that Trump continues to lie to, and throw his own people under the bus constantly and yet they still stand behind him. He has gleefully and unapologetically screwed over every single person that has had his back without fail. When will they say “enough is enough” and decide they can work with Pence better?'
"The thing is that nobody voting for these people cares about this to change their vote. The US needs to get rid of the first past the post system so there's more than two parties and nobody thinks in terms of us or them. Because no matter what they do, it's still is one of us or one of them. "
'Gotta give props to Sen. Durbin for exposing them (Cotton and Perdue) by cornering Sen. Graham as the one who spoke up when Trump made the ‘shithole’ comment by praising it as having done the right thing.  \n&nbsp;  \nIt is like killing two birds with one stone. ‘Chess Master 9000’ played by Sen. Durbin. '
'> Perhaps lawmakers should insist that all their interactions with the president be recorded so as to prevent more incidents such as this in the future.\n\nSounds good. Why not?'
'And every fiber of our collective beings should, because basic human rights shouldn’t be up for political debate, but...\n\nTo use same sex marriage as an example: I am friends with a lot of Republicans, I live in a very red state, and almost all of them are against it only because “liberals keep pushing the gay stuff on me”. They literally see us as the enemy, even after they admit or say things like “honestly, I don’t really care if a same sex couple wants to marry, it’s their life so who am I to say”.  (This is a direct quote from a conversation btw).\n\nIt wasn’t until I tried to understand their positions not from a political viewpoint, but from one of “liberals are the enemy” could I understand how it was they held contradictory viewpoints like that.\n\nIt’s actually very depressing to realize your friends, and the majority of your state, view you as an enemy.'
'Yeah, um, i\'m not sure there is one.\n\n>The Wall Street Journal reports that Trump’s lawyers are researching a 1997 case in which a federal appeals court ruled that sitting presidents and their top advisers are protected against disclosing certain information about decision-making and official government actions.\n\nDoesn\'t sound too hot of a case to use in defense. Considering we\'re talking about a criminal element here.\n\nAlso the Clinton vs. Jones ruling says "the President, like all other government officials, is subject to the same laws that apply to all other members of our society."'
'This is the smartest possible move by his attorneys. On a daily basis, we see what happens when he goes off script. \n\nFor example, yesterday at Davos, he gives this laid back speech about America wanting to do business with the world. Then he starts talking to the scrum and it teeters wildly between him bragging about how easy it has always been for him to make money and how terrible the media is to him. \n\nI’m starting to find myself daydreaming about Trump actually talking to Mueller and having a *Few Good Men* moment. \n\nM: Did you knowingly collude with the Russians and then fire Comey because he was getting too close...?\n\nT: **YOU’RE GODDAMN RIGHT I DID!!!**\n'
'!00% chance Trump pleads the fifth.'
'Trump supporters: [*laughs nervously with eye twitch*]'
"The precedents (primarily set during the Jones v Clinton lawsuit) are all against them on this one. So they can thank Paula Jones's legal team for screwing them. \n\nFun fact: Ann Coulter was a member of that legal team. The work she did then is going to help bring Trump down. The irony is so thick you could cut it with a knife. "
'I thought Mr. Stable Genius was looking forward to the interview.  Are his lawyers saying he is a liar??'
"This is non-news. Of course Trump's legal team is going to try and get him out of a face-to-face meeting. Good on them for at least earning the money that Trump will later refuse to pay them."
"Wasn't it just ⅖ Mooches ago that Trump was openly willing to talk to Mueller??"
"Wait, but I thought he said he looks forward to talking to Mueller under oath.  He wouldn't lie about something like that."
'Totally the actions of a completely innocent man.'
"Nice of The Hill to recycle WSJ's work."
"Everybody knows that if you're innocent you discredit the witnesses and institutions that will clear your name, and seek to avoid proving your own innocence."
'Something tells me certain subreddits are about to become giant fans of the 5th amendment.'
"Shouldn't a genius of other-worldly genetic makeup - possibly the smartest man to ever live (everyone is saying it) have no problem testifying under oath to 100% prove his innocence without perjuring himself?"
"Clearly no collusion, these are the actions you take when you're innocent"
'If it comes to such a nightmare scenario where the president can refuse all of these appearances before grand juries and even the supreme court. Even if the members of Congress refuse to impeach him then they shall be made to testify and be removed. There is no way that this corrupt president is bulletproof'
"it's what all innocent people do - scour legal precedent because there's no clear way for them to *not* testify.\n\nI mean most people would say if you're innocent you wouldn't testify because there would be *no charges of any kind brought against you* because you didn't do anything. but that's splitting hairs, no?"
'Mueller has a trump card (no pun intended) though, which is grand jury subpoena. Trumps team doesnt want that.'
'Yeah don’t think the bone spurs will get him outta of that. '
"If he's innocent, he's got nothing to fear... Right? That's their whistle isn't it?"
"I understand his lawyers don't want him talking to anybody, if it is on the record. This may go all the way to US supreme court and only GOD knows how they would rule?\nClinton testified and that was about a sexual affair. Trump is up to his eyeballs in treason. Why shouldn't he have to testify?\nI forgot, laws don't apply to republicans."
'For a supposedly innocent man, he sure is acting awfully guilty.'
"That doesn't reek of guilt at all. /s"

'Good luck proving damages. '
"Stormy Daniels' lawyer is truly impressive."
'So many people prematurely celebrating. I won’t believe this snake will go down until I actually see it happen. '
"We keep hearing this narrative that Trump didn't actually want to win the election, and that winning became a problem they weren't planning for. But then why the desperate hush money right before the election? Seems totally unnecessary, and possibly a bad move considering that taking some heat in order to lose right at the end would've been OK. To me...one possible explanation is that Trump could've been coerced into ACTUALLY trying to win. I don't even think he would've had the mental capacity to go and try hush up Stormy. Sounds like someone found out, and then orchestrated the plan."
'My favorite reality show right now'
'Now *this* is my kinda 4D chess! Well played Daniels. '
'Now this is what I call justice porn. '
"Stormy Daniels cannot be made to pay the 20 mill plus because the clause says all parties must sign to be valid. Trump didn't sign and there is a line for his signature.  If Trump sues for liable he'll have to testify. "
"Is there a chance that the DVD shows DNA evidence that Daniels' daughter is Trump's?  "

'When Trumps lawyer needs a lawyer lol. The political inception begins. '
'Luckily for Trump, a lawyer and their client cannot be charged for the same crime.'
'Yo dawg, we heard you like litigation so we got your lawyer a lawyer so he can be litigated while he litigates!'
"If I ever need an attorney, I'm definitely hiring Avenatti. "
"After today's WH press briefing there might be a few more defamation cases. Lol"
'lol, this is fantastic, this potus is a shitbird!'
"Stormy Daniels' lawyer seems to really know what he's doing, and she seems intent on really getting Trump on this. He does a good job of keeping this in the headlines with some new development every few days, and hinting at things to keep suspense. For example the tweet of the DVD in the safe."
'dementia, 8 months of psychological evaluation is pretty enough for me. '
"I think all elected officials over the age of 50 should have to take a mental health screening every 12 months. The screening panel should be anonymous to the public, bi-partisan, and drawn from both liberal and conservative backgrounds.\n\nIf the Democrats propose such a bill, and don't single out my President specifically, I'll support it. In the mean time you can take this trash bill and burn it. It'll never pass. This is political theater and red meat to a starving base. Propose *real* legislation or don't waste our time. Calling my (R) Senator tomorrow."
"Trump would invoke executive privilege.\n\nSeriously, the 25th Amendment doesn't exist for Congress to invoke or screw around with. It's there for POTUS or VP and cabinet to invoke, not Congress.\n\nSorry, Rep Lofgren, Trump is POTUS. He may be the worst POTUS the US has ever had or will ever have, but he's still the choice of the Electoral College. If you believe a President Pence would be better, it's you rather than President Trump who needs their head examined."
'Sounds like huge potential for backfire down the road.\n\nDC doctors and medical experts hired to evaluate elected officials could result in some very convenient findings.'
'Can we do this for the whole of Congress as well?  There are people who still think George Bush is president...'
"There's something definitely wrong. When he went on the SA trip and he was off his sleep schedule, at times his eyes looked completely black/glazed over, like nobody was home."
'"Can I pardon myself and my family from these mental health evaluations?"\n'
'Its not really up for debate.\n\nIf you compare his speech patterns from a decade or two ago to now, he is either in rapid cognitive decline or is intentionally hurting glue before giving speeches to better "connect and relate to his base"'
"If we make our cops and military who have (comparatively) limited power go through mental health testing before taking office, shouldn't the guy who has the NUKE CODES get one before he takes office????!   They also have to go through re-evaluations every so often. Our president should have to as well. "
"It is worth remembering that, unlike previous Presidents, Trump has not released the results of a medical examination of himself conducted by universally-recognized, competent, medical professionals. Like his taxes, he's kept the facts about his health secret. The only reason can be that he's hiding something important."
'One of the most successful businessman in the US has mental problems. Sure. Reason #65 even classical liberals turning away from the soon-to-be deceased Democratic Party.'
'You guys are on some next level fan fiction role playing with this. What does this have to do with your 2018 and 2020 runs? ever think maybe you should start talking about issues americans face and not taking jabs at trump, because we know thats all this is.

He does that sort of thing a lot in general, he'll say something that is not true but just by saying it it's like it is true to him.

"I know that the safe bet is to assume that he is compromised by Russia and following Putin's orders.  That's surely what it looks like.\n\nBut Trump is also a ridiculous egoist, and a moron to boot.  I think there's a decent chance that Trump can't understand the difference between the suspicion that Russia interfered with the 2016 election, and the suspicion that his campaign colluded with the Russian government to make it happen.\n\nHe is so emotionally invested in having legitimately won the presidency that he openly lied about the size of his inauguration crowd.  I think it's possible that he only defends Putin because he cannot bear to face the possibility that he won the election illegitimately.  To defend the legitimacy of his presidency, he feels moved to defend Russia, because the truth might make him look bad.\n\nRegardless of the true motive, it is clear that Trump is totally unfit to hold the office that he does, as no matter what the implications may be for his presidency, any leader that takes an oath to uphold a democracy ought to take foreign election meddling *deathly* seriously.\n\nA democracy cannot survive when the votes are corrupted.\n\nSo Trump is either following Putin's orders for personal gain (or to avoid personal destruction), in which case he is guilty of treason and ought to face to death penalty for high crimes against America.\n\nOr he's trying to handwave the truth away for his own personal satisfaction, in which case he should be removed from office for completely lacking the capacity to do the job he was elected to do."

'The WSJ article in question: https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-lawyers-aim-to-decide-by-may-17-whether-president-testifies-in-mueller-probe-1525727774\n\nWASHINGTON—Lawyers advising President Donald Trump in the Russia investigation hope to decide whether he should testify by May 17, the one-year anniversary of the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani said Monday.\n\nMr. Trump’s legal team has long been divided on whether he should agree to a sit-down interview with Mr. Mueller, a decision that exposes him to legal perils but also could hasten the end of an investigation that has shadowed his presidency.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Giuliani said, “every day we swing a little different” on whether to advise Mr. Trump to talk to Mr. Mueller, though he suggested that recent developments in the probe have made him more leery.\n\nThe president’s initial position was “what do I have to lose? I’m telling the truth,” Mr. Giuliani said. But Mr. Trump has also promised to weigh his lawyers’ advice.\n\nIn a tweet on Monday, Mr. Trump made clear his displeasure with the prosecutors running the Russia probe, describing them as “13 Angry Democrats.” He went on to suggest he might raise an issue with the courts about “unrevealed conflicts of interest” inside the Mueller team.\n\nMr. Mueller, a registered Republican, has served under presidents of both parties, including 12 years as FBI director after being named to that post by then President George W. Bush, a Republican. His team includes many Democrats, some of whom contributed to Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump’s opponent in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMr. Mueller is investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential race. He is also examining whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice in firing FBI Director James Comey a year ago. Mr. Trump has denied any collusion or obstruction, while Russia has denied interfering in the election.\n\nMr. Trump’s legal team has undergone a makeover over the past two months, with Mr. Giuliani now assuming the dominant public role.\n\nThe mix of lawyers could influence Mr. Trump’s ultimate decision, given their differing views on the merits of an interview. John Dowd, once the lead outside attorney who opposed an interview, resigned from the team.\n\nBut Mr. Trump is also losing Ty Cobb, the lawyer handling the Russia probe inside the White House. Mr. Cobb has been more open to the prospect of an interview under certain conditions. The latest addition to the legal lineup is Washington lawyer Emmet Flood. Of all of them, Mr. Giuliani is closest to Mr. Trump personally.\n\nMr. Giuliani said he came into the case last month skeptical about letting Mr. Trump testify, based on his own experience as a former U.S. attorney and private lawyer.\n\n“I’m not sure any client of mine has ever testified, and I sure as heck have benefited from ones who were dumb enough to do it” when he served as a prosecutor, Mr. Giuliani said.\n\nAnother consideration is how Mr. Trump would perform as a witness and whether he has the discipline to avoid unnecessary tangents that open himself to new questions.\n\n“Anyone can see he has great difficulty staying on a subject,” one person familiar with the legal team’s deliberations said.\n\nIn his initial discussions with Mr. Mueller’s team, though, Mr. Giuliani said the prosecutors seemed “reasonable as to the ground rules.” He said he came away believing that an interview “had gone up in possibility.”\n\nSouring him, though, was a court hearing last week in which a federal judge, T.S. Ellis, questioned Mr. Mueller’s authority to bring tax and bank-fraud charges against Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. The judge, an appointee of former President Ronald Reagan, said Mr. Mueller’s aim was to squeeze Mr. Manafort for more information about Mr. Trump.\n\n“They’re not really interested in Manafort, just in trapping the president,” Mr. Giuliani said. “It shows they’ll go pretty far to trap him.”\n\nA safe course for the president is to decline to testify, Mr. Giuliani said. But such a move could set off a legal showdown if Mr. Mueller then slaps the president with a grand jury subpoena.\n\n“They [the special counsel’s team] made it easier not to testify by their improper conduct,” Mr. Giuliani said.\n\nHe added, “So, I don’t think we’d pay the same public price for not testifying that we might have before.”\n\nPreparing Mr. Trump to testify would be a serious distraction to his work as president, eating into time he needs to deal with pressing global issues, Mr. Trump’s lawyers contend.\n\n**In an informal, four-hour practice session, Mr. Trump’s lawyers were only able to walk him through two questions, given the frequent interruptions on national-security matters along with Mr. Trump’s loquaciousness, one person familiar with the matter said.**\n\nMeanwhile, the turnover has created a separate problem for Mr. Trump’s defense: His lawyers lack security clearances, which could limit the documents and materials they can see.\n\nWhen Mr. Dowd left in March, he was the only outside lawyer who held a clearance. The outside team as it now stands—Jay Sekulow, Marty and Jane Raskin and Mr. Giuliani—are all in the process of applying for security clearances, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nMr. Cobb, who works in the White House, holds a security clearance, but he plans to leave at the end of the month.\n\nLegal experts said Mr. Giuliani may struggle to get a clearance, given his consulting work on behalf of foreign countries in past years, including a Qatari state-owned oil company.\n\n—Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.'

'>It is not illegal for the subject of an investigation to learn what witnesses have told investigators. But that is usually done through lawyers for the people involved because their communications are often shielded from prosecutors because of attorney-client privilege.

'Hillary Clinton was not president.\n\nThe classification springs from the office of the president, meaning Trump literally cant be prosecuted for leaking classified information.

Trump imposes a LOWER tariff and /r/politics has a conniption. '
"From what I'm reading, solar cells already had tariffs imposed on them. This is simply an increase. Apparently the International Trade Commission recommended tariffs of up to 35% because imports apparently seriously injure domestic markets. A couple of bankrupt US solar companies have asked for the tariffs, which makes sense from their point of view. \n\nAlso, the WTO tends to overrule penalties imposed through this particular provision, so apparently this won't last long.\n\nI personally don't know what to think. I'm a fan of a bit of protectionism to keep our markets competitive, and importing solar cells seems contradictory for renewable energy systems which are supposed to be cutting down on fossil fuels. However, I imagine that this only benefits a few companies that asked for the support."
'Does anyone care that China is dumping solar panels illegally? The Chinese states subsidizes cheap solar panels with the aim of wiping out competition. The tariff is necessary to force China to compete in the open market. This subreddit is as circlejerk as it gets. '

"I am actually more than slightly ok with this. We should be replacing mining jobs with green energy jobs.

He did something good for once, give credit where its due, but don't forget what a massive piece of shit he is either."
'Republicans think of these bold moves without ever asking the question "and then what?"  Does he think that the Chinese will just stand there awe struck and not retaliate?'
'And just like that, Trump kills 50,000 Jobs. \n\nThere were 18,000 MWs of residential roof top solar installed last year. The largest nuke plant in the US is the Palo Verde, which has a 4,000 MW capacity. So not only has cheap solar panels given high paying jobs to hundred of thousands of US workers, but been responsible for adding ~4 Palo Verde power plants to the grid. \n\nThe US can’t make solar panels competitively any more than they can make Trumps shirts, which also happen to be made in China. \n\nWeird how there aren’t tariffs on his or his daughters clothing from China. '
'I’m sure other countries will just take it and not retaliate in any way.'
"This motherfucker.  I get a little steamed at the things Trump does, but this just cannot be allowed to happen.  Fossil fuels are a dying industry, and no amount of protection or hobbling of the competition will ultimately save it.  Most importantly though, clean, renewable energy is the future for seemingly every country but the US for damn good reasons, and if we don't follow suit, we'll be severely disadvantaged.  Aside from the fact that we are destroying human-inhabitable zones at an alarming rate, clean energy is cheaper, practically infinite, and solves huge swathes of our problems through simple adoption.  This president of ours is selling out our futures, our ability to adapt to literal, imminent disaster and our scientific birthright to prosper under smarter and more sustainable technologies.  Everything I believe in Trump is trying to destroy."

Later that month the emails were released via Wiki and DC leaks as part of a quid pro quo to remove the Russian sanctions plank of the RNC and to ease sanctions if Trump were ever elected. It all fits quite nicely indeed. Did I miss something? "

In 2006 US owners of the chain of companies mentioned above gained an income of over USD 800 million, including 66 million Gazprom shares received as dividends. According to preliminary estimates, the damage to the Russian budget in the form of unpaid taxes from those activities exceeded RUB 1 billion. There is every reason to believe that the investment activity was not declared and was not included in the reports to the US Securities Committee and US tax authorities, and no taxes were paid by US companies on the income received as a result of the turnover of the shares of the Russian companies.  \n\nMs. Veselnitskaya's Memo\n\n> As soon as Browder's activity became the subject of attention of Russian law enforcement bodies and he was banned to enter the country on a tourist visa, in January 2006 all assets controlled by Ziff Brothers Investments were siphoned off from the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation. \n\n> Reportedly, the American owners of the above chain of companies, in 2006 received an income of over $ 800 million, including 66 million shares of Gazprom they received as dividends. \n\n> Roughly estimated, the damage to the budget of the Russian Federation caused by this activity in the form of unpaid taxes amounted to over 1 billion rubles. \n\n> At the same time, no information was found in any open sources of tax and investment (exchange) registries of the United States relating to the declaration by those companies of their investment activities abroad and their payment of taxes in the amount of 35%, which may indicate a major tax evasion in the US, as well as of legalization of criminal proceeds from transactions falling within the scope of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act . \n\n**SIMILARITY 4:**\n\nRohrabacher's Document:\n\n> In 2007, realizing the realistic threat of exposure by both the Russian and US law enforcement authorities, Browder accomplished an egregious scheme of embezzlement of funds from the Russian Treasury, the main element of it being to create an alibi of him having nothing to do with the embezzlement, by way of simulation of theft of three Russian portfolio companies from Hermitage Fund (HSBC). \n\nMs. Veselnitskaya's Memo\n\n> Realizing the real risk of exposure to law enforcement agencies of Russia and the United States, as well as to the deceived or misled clients, Browder invents a bold scheme of embezzlement of budget funds from the Treasury of Russia, the main element of which was the creation of an alibi of non-involvement in the embezzlement in the form of imitation of theft from the Hermitage Fund of three Russian portfolio companies.

But Mueller has been looking at other stuff too, like the money. So I have to imagine he's got enough to move forward. I wonder if he's still chasing leads, or if it's just a waiting game for the next election at this point.

It also suggests that emails from an intermediary to the younger Mr. Trump promising that Ms. Veselnitskaya would arrive with information from Russian prosecutors were rooted at least partly in fact —\xa0not mere “puffery,”\xa0as the president’s son later said.\n\n>In the past week, Ms. Veselnitskaya’s allegations — that major Democratic donors were guilty of financial fraud and tax evasion — have been embraced at the highest levels of the Russian government.

Fox and Friends? \n\n\nEither way, it fills with me joy seeing how Trump's tweet was then followed by this article.  I wonder if he has heard yet about this article. \n\nI'm going to assume that since Manafort is already expecting an indictment, Jr, and Kushner may see indictments as well. As for Trump himself, I do have to acknowledge there is the possiblity he could have had no idea about this until he was elected and he is just trying to cover up his subordinates crimes.

They don't like Trump, but between the tax cuts and deregulation, they love his policies.  The recent tariffs that Trump imposed on the our allies has upset the Koch brothers, but as of yet, nothing has come to pass.  I would surmise to them the theatrics Trump engages in are nothing significant.  So long as he keeps doing what they want, they'll let him play his little game with the media. It has the added bonus of pissing off liberals.  Should Trump begin to pose a threat to their profits, you can be sure they will force Congress to act.\n\nThe other thing that is scary about these people is they have no real desire to live in a democracy.  For years now, they've been funding an effort to [rewrite the Constitution](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-conservative-plan-to-rewrite-the-constitution-and-yes-its-a-thing).

In a few generations, most households will have portraits of Trump in their living rooms, and schools will teach children about that time President Trump made a trip to the sun and came back. All of this is easier to accomplish if you isolate the population from the rest of the world through measures like, let's say, stopping all international trade using ridiculous tariffs as a tool, getting out of any multinational alliances and deals, and potentially, abolishing net neutrality, giving companies like AT&T (which clearly has political leverage already) the opportunity to charge you more for access to certain webpages and online services, and maybe even block access to any foreign websites altogether. Of course, none of this will happen without a fight from the Democrats in the form of a civil war, but judging by the reaction time of the general population, even this might be too little too late.

"Obama's response (Remember when we had a president with a vocabulary larger than a couple dozen words?):\n\nThere are few issues more important to the security of the United States than the potential spread of nuclear weapons, or the potential for even more destructive war in the Middle East. That’s why the United States negotiated the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in the first place.\n\nThe reality is clear. The JCPOA is working – that is a view shared by our European allies, independent experts, and the current U.S. Secretary of Defense. The JCPOA is in America’s interest – it has significantly rolled back Iran’s nuclear program. And the JCPOA is a model for what diplomacy can accomplish – its inspections and verification regime is precisely what the United States should be working to put in place with North Korea. Indeed, at a time when we are all rooting for diplomacy with North Korea to succeed, walking away from the JCPOA risks losing a deal that accomplishes – with Iran – the very outcome that we are pursuing with the North Koreans. \n\nThat is why today’s announcement is so misguided. Walking away from the JCPOA turns our back on America’s closest allies, and an agreement that our country’s leading diplomats, scientists, and intelligence professionals negotiated. In a democracy, there will always be changes in policies and priorities from one Administration to the next. But the consistent flouting of agreements that our country is a party to risks eroding America’s credibility, and puts us at odds with the world’s major powers.\n\nDebates in our country should be informed by facts, especially debates that have proven to be divisive. So it’s important to review several facts about the JCPOA.\n\nFirst, the JCPOA was not just an agreement between my Administration and the Iranian government. After years of building an international coalition that could impose crippling sanctions on Iran, we reached the JCPOA together with the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the European Union, Russia, China, and Iran. It is a multilateral arms control deal, unanimously endorsed by a United Nations Security Council Resolution. \n\nSecond, the JCPOA has worked in rolling back Iran’s nuclear program. For decades, Iran had steadily advanced its nuclear program, approaching the point where they could rapidly produce enough fissile material to build a bomb. The JCPOA put a lid on that breakout capacity. Since the JCPOA was implemented, Iran has destroyed the core of a reactor that could have produced weapons-grade plutonium; removed two-thirds of its centrifuges (over 13,000) and placed them under international monitoring; and eliminated 97 percent of its stockpile of enriched uranium – the raw materials necessary for a bomb. So by any measure, the JCPOA has imposed strict limitations on Iran's nuclear program and achieved real results. \n\nThird, the JCPOA does not rely on trust – it is rooted in the most far-reaching inspections and verification regime ever negotiated in an arms control deal. Iran’s nuclear facilities are strictly monitored. International monitors also have access to Iran’s entire nuclear supply chain, so that we can catch them if they cheat. Without the JCPOA, this monitoring and inspections regime would go away. \n\nFourth, Iran is complying with the JCPOA. That was not simply the view of my Administration. The United States intelligence community has continued to find that Iran is meeting its responsibilities under the deal, and has reported as much to Congress. So have our closest allies, and the international agency responsible for verifying Iranian compliance – the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). \n\nFifth, the JCPOA does not expire. The prohibition on Iran ever obtaining a nuclear weapon is permanent. Some of the most important and intrusive inspections codified by the JCPOA are permanent. Even as some of the provisions in the JCPOA do become less strict with time, this won’t happen until ten, fifteen, twenty, or twenty-five years into the deal, so there is little reason to put those restrictions at risk today.\n\nFinally, the JCPOA was never intended to solve all of our problems with Iran. We were clear-eyed that Iran engages in destabilizing behavior – including support for terrorism, and threats toward Israel and its neighbors. But that’s precisely why it was so important that we prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Every aspect of Iranian behavior that is troubling is far more dangerous if their nuclear program is unconstrained. Our ability to confront Iran’s destabilizing behavior – and to sustain a unity of purpose with our allies – is strengthened with the JCPOA, and weakened without it. \n\nBecause of these facts, I believe that the decision to put the JCPOA at risk without any Iranian violation of the deal is a serious mistake. Without the JCPOA, the United States could eventually be left with a losing choice between a nuclear-armed Iran or another war in the Middle East. We all know the dangers of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon. It could embolden an already dangerous regime; threaten our friends with destruction; pose unacceptable dangers to America’s own security; and trigger an arms race in the world’s most dangerous region. If the constraints on Iran’s nuclear program under the JCPOA are lost, we could be hastening the day when we are faced with the choice between living with that threat, or going to war to prevent it. \n\nIn a dangerous world, America must be able to rely in part on strong, principled diplomacy to secure our country. We have been safer in the years since we achieved the JCPOA, thanks in part to the work of our diplomats, many members of Congress, and our allies. Going forward, I hope that Americans continue to speak out in support of the kind of strong, principled, fact-based, and unifying leadership that can best secure our country and uphold our responsibilities around the globe.

"Wouldn't that be an odd situation if Mueller provides enough by the end of this year that it's clear that as soon the Democrats come into power in the house in January, Trump will be impeached, successfully, and Pence with him, and so, after a year and half of indefensible protection for 45, the GOP ends up falling over themselves in the last months of the year trying to conduct history's quickest impeachment to get Ryan or McCarthy in as president instead of Pelosi?"
'I love watching David Cay Johnston on news shows. He always refers to Trump as "Donald" because he knows how much it irritates him.'
'Fox News: “trump was never a traitor because he’s *never* purported to be faithful to the US, the public should have realized given his actions.”'

If Democrats control the House, they control who gets to be VP. Someone sane, squeaky clean, and actually responsible would finish out the term. '
'Here’s my theory: \n\n“Russia has the most beautiful prostitutes” is a code phrase. Putin said it in a speech, then Trump repeated it to Comey a few days later. \n\nCode phrases are used to convey orders when you can’t speak with assets directly, and they’re also useful to verify who else is part of a conspiracy when used with a counter phrase.\n\nAlso, Trump got into bad debt with the Russians in the ‘90s, and has been an FSB asset for the last 25 years. Keep in mind this is someone who hangs out with presidents and goes to government functions. He’s been feeding them intel, and arranging for US officials to do drugs and hookers on hidden cameras to further Russia’s influence. \n\nOr maybe my tinfoil hat is too tight... '

"I'm really disappointed in my fellow scouts. A Scout is courteous and kind not some mob who eats up trumps rhetoric "
'It is worth watching the entire speech.  The reaction of the crowd is what worries me.  They loved it.  Trump just politicized the boy scouts.  Trump Youth.'

'This is the face of your party Republicans. You own this clown-like behavior.  '
'Scout Mom chiming me, me and a couple of other parents have already sent letters to the BSA letting them know (in scathing, yet, polite terms) that they need to let Trump know that this was wrong.\n\nWhat made it worse was that the Scouts were given a flyer beforehand that told them that they were not allowed to let their political beliefs show (because, honestly, Scouts is not a place for politics, and that\'s true).  So the fact that Trump had a captive audience, that he got to use to get a bunch of 13-18 kids to "boo" Obama, yet the kids who weren\'t too keen on him were not allowed to "boo" him is unconscionable.  '
'But Trump demands "decorum" and "politeness" from journalists who ask about things out of place. Surely he can do the same!?!'
'As a former Boy Scout this is disgusting. He basically bragged about the orgies that his friend had on his yacht... "And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very interesting life. I won’t go on any more than that because you’re Boy Scouts, so I’m not going to tell you what he did"'
'Oh, cute. He just rallied a crowd of socially awkward white boys. Have they been re-incarnated as the red star Trump youth yet?'
'About 40k Boy Scouts cheering a few dozen parents complaining?'
'It\'s just truly sad to me that Trump uses what should be a unique moment for Boy Scouts, a Presidential speech, and uses it to bash previous Presidents.  Who does that?  No President in history would do that at such an event.  Of course Trump would, all the while stroking his ego and turning his back to gloat because he got some teenagers to show disappointment that Obama didn\'t show up previously.  \n\nYa know the funny thing about this is that if you look at the Boy Scout Law, that wonderful rhythmic series of tenets a scout is supposed to represent (and memorize if you didn\'t suck at it like me), Trump is like the polar opposite of every piece of it.  Coincidentally leading off with "Trustworthy", the quality he could never even pretend to have.  But he certainly expects that "Loyal" part to shine through (for everyone but himself).'
'So, Trump goes up there to stoke his ego and talk about things that have nothing to do with Boy Scouts, or kids in general. Really classy. Using children as his political prop'
"There is this urban legend where Fidel Castro used to go to school and ask the children to pray to God for candy. The children prayed and of course, no candy received. Then he'll ask them to pray to Fidel for candy, then proceed to give them candy.\n\nThis is today's version of Fidel's propaganda."
'He spread his toxicity to an organization meant to instill leadership skills in children and specifically meant to be apolitical. \n\nAnd he got them to boo Obama based on flat-out lies. \n\nHis speech only accomplished dividing the parents of boy scouts, and dividing former scouts along political lines. The antithesis of why the organization exists. \n\n\nHow could parents not be mad? '
'This is the kind of journalism that makes you not trust the media.  Watch the video.  The title could have been easily "scouts excited about trump" or something.  The reception was higggghhly in his favor....but they choose to take a handful of negative comments...from many who weren\'t even there and push a hit piece?  \n\nGet ready for another trump win in 2020.... people see through the deception'

'Its not very surprising.  \n\nIt is a good read, but the Nunes memo was clearly just partisan flailing anyway.  Page was a known quantity to the FBI. The likelihood that the Steele dossier was critical to authorizing or renewing a FISA warrant on him was a stretch.\n\nInteresting to note that Page had been interviewed in March 2016, though. '
"Trump is having another meltdown on twitter tonight.  The Dem memo is really freaking him out.  He's going after Schiff and praising Nunes as a great American hero. \n\nTrump and Republicans are such vile people it's hard to wrap your head around it."
'An interesting read. It paints a story that Nunes could be charged with obstructing justice.'
'Ok, so I’ve read the two memos and the new rebuttal of the rebuttal. The one thing that really stood out to me is the amount of hard redactions in the minority memo (Schiff). The evidence used against the majority memo’s claims is wholly acknowledged to exist, and furthermore is deemed valuable enough to not compromise by the accused party itself. The guy who made the majority memo (Nunes) also admitted to not having read the classified source materials used for most of its claims, which is kind of a weird thing not to do when you’re the purported sole author of the memo with access to all of the classified source materials.'

'Actually, the FBI Deputy Director only confirmed that Comey told him this at the time. McCabe wasn\'t there, so he can\'t "confirm" anything Trump did or didn\'t say.\n\nThis adds even more credibility to Comey\'s (already very credible) account of what happened, but it\'s factually incorrect to say that McCabe confirmed Comey\'s story.\n\nFor example, if Jared Kushner or someone testified that on the day of the Comey meeting, Trump mentioned that he never asked for Comey\'s loyalty, you wouldn\'t consider this to be "confirmation" that Trump never asked for Comey\'s loyalty. You\'d rightly see it only as confirmation that this was Trump\'s story on the day in question. The same standard applies here, so Shareblue should stop publishing misleading headlines.'

If you're looking to maximize impact, you're going to do the opposite and publish it right when the material will get the most attention. There were dozens of electronic blueprints on our election systems, not DNC's server, which was actually never inspected by the authorities which is astonishing. If you had any legitimate evidence for Russia being the source you would be including that with sources.

At that point its obvious that WL would speak up about that out of righteous anger. \n\nYour credentials? Did I ask for those?

"What I really don't understand is how people like Comey and Mueller can be Republicans in the first place. They're dignified, honest, profoundly intelligent men of honor who devote their lives to serving their country and promoting justice. These things are *utterly* at odds with what the GOP stands for, and this has really been the case for decades. What part of the Republican package is it that they support? \n\nComey isn't a registered Republican anymore, but he was for most of his life, and Mueller still is. What could they possibly see in the GOP that does more good than the immense harm they do to America? How are devoted men of justice not wildly opposed to the devious, deceitful and frequently criminal practices of this political party? \n\nEven if we assume that they're in favor of, say, a smaller government or a stronger military or something, surely people such as these would see that this part of the Republican playbook is utterly dwarfed by the rest of that corrupt, racist, anti-humanitarian circus. I don't doubt that they *are* men of honor and integrity, but I simply cannot comprehend how they can choose that side of the political spectrum. It simply doesn't compute. \n\nIt's clear that they're not sycophants of the GOP, and clearly have a rapidly increasing number of bitter enemies within the party. Even if we imagine that they're simply opposed to Trump, it's not as if he's all that's wrong with the GOP. He's a symptom of what they've been working towards for ages, and you cannot remain blind to the bigotry and corruption that is so deeply ingrained in the party when you've been director of the fucking FBI.\n\nDo they think that the few remaining Republican policies of remotely arguable validity count for more than the immense evil and wanton destruction that the GOP inflicts upon America? I don't want to suspect that these guys are actually racists or something, but it's hard to imagine what the hell else it could be."

"As a Canadian I just have to laugh a bit. Maybe our history lessons are fundamentally different from what's taught in America but regardless of the small fact that it was the British and not Canadians who burned down the White House (we like to joke about it, but we all know that we were a British colony and not a country back then), the most important lesson about the War of 1812 is the longest lasting friendship that came after the end of the war. 200 years of continued friendship, trading partners, military allies, and coming to each others aid when the need arises.\n\nThat's not even mentioning that back in 1812 Canada could have been considered a military threat to America. Now, not so much. It's getting much harder to be sympathetic to the chaos that's going on in America these days. If you guys don't want us to be friends anymore I guess we'll just have to deal with it.  "

Francis Cissna said the number of cases could reach into the thousands—this in a nation of about 325 million.\n\n“We finally have a process in place to get to the bottom of all these bad cases and start denaturalizing people who should not have been naturalized in the first place,” Cissna said. “What we’re looking at, when you boil it all down, is potentially a few thousand cases.”'
'Wonder how many of those denaturalized will be white. Probably none, racist piece of trash. '
'MS-13 is the fulcrum for this entire process. Any crooked government agency can easily fabricate a "tie" to MS-13 as grounds for denaturalization.  \n\nWe\'ll see entire Mexican-American families deported because their teenage son is wearing a blue bandana. '
'First, they came for the illegals. I did not speak up, because I was not an illegal. \n\nThen...'
'Anyone else feel like denaturalizing Trump?'
'"CNN reports that that the new office in Southern California will review cases and then refer them to the Justice Department, which will then pursue denaturalization proceedings against U.S. citizens **accused of fraud**."\n\nMakes sense to me.'
"This is how a country reaches a situation that resembles North Korea. The government impregnates a whole culture with false information on practically any given topic while doing whatever they want, and when confronted about it, they never address the wrongdoing. People let it go eventually. If this happens frequently enough and the lies remain undisputed for a long period of time, the entire civilization starts to function based on precepts that are fundamentally wrong.\n\nIn a few generations, most households will have portraits of Trump in their living rooms, and schools will teach children about that time President Trump made a trip to the sun and came back.\n\nAll of this is easier to accomplish if you isolate the population from the rest of the world through measures like, let's say, stopping all international trade using ridiculous tariffs as a tool, getting out of any multinational alliances and deals, and potentially, abolishing net neutrality, giving companies like AT&T (which clearly has political leverage already) the opportunity to charge you more for access to certain webpages and online services, and maybe even block access to any foreign websites altogether.\n\nOf course, none of this will happen without a fight from the Democrats in the form of a civil war, but judging by the reaction time of the general population, even this might be too little too late. The rest of the world will make lots of books, movies, series and maybe even videogames of this event in a few years in the same fashion as WW2 and yet, will have learned nothing. Rinse and repeat with a different civilization."
"I'm not sorry, but if you support this, you are a pile of shit."

"Were the Germans who didn't speak up against the Nazis during WWII complicit?  Yes.  Were they also Nazis?  Debatable.    \n   \nIt's time to have that debate about Trump and the GOP.  "

'Happy Friday, fellow F5 Knights of New.'
"Hope you had your breakfast folks, we're getting going early today!"
'I think this might be the most significant development yet.  Can anybody think of a single reason why Mueller would allow Gates to cop a plea in exchange for cooperation *other than him providing information that directly implicates Trump and/or Trump’s associates in criminal wrongdoing*?  He has *dozens* of charges against him.  From the outside looking in, the case looks to be pretty airtight.  Manafort is the biggest target Mueller has formally indicted/charged as of right now, and he has more than enough evidence to put Manafort away for life - so he doesn’t need Gates’ help to send Manafort to a cell.  What other reason could there possibly be to let this guy off the hook unless he’s providing substantial evidence against current and/or former administration officials?  \n\nGates was involved at a high level all the way through Election Day and into the transition.  If anybody would have intimate details of the inner workings of Trump’s campaign it’d be him.  Add that to all of the crazy ass ranting that Trump has been doing over the past two weeks and it certainly seems like this is the biggest step so far in this marathon.'

'I’m interested to see what Manafort does with all of this.  On federal charges, he is royally fucked, and he may be hoping for a Presidential pardon.  I’m wondering if Mueller is waiting for Trump to flinch and show his cards to either pardon Manafort or distance himself from him.  Mueller then can either say, the President is distancing himself from you, are you sure you want life in prison for protecting this asshole?  Or if the President is talking pardon, Mueller drops a bunch of state charges through the NY AG (people who avoid paying fed taxes most likely don’t pay state taxes too).  At that point, Manafort is truly Manafucked, and the obstruction case against Trump gets that much stronger....'

It implies that only God can judge an unjust king and that any attempt to depose, dethrone or restrict his powers runs contrary to the will of God and may constitute a sacrilegious act. It is often expressed in the phrase "by the Grace of God", attached to the titles of a reigning monarch.\n\nUm, no.

"Being that McCabe is a public figure, defamation has a very high bar. That said, the merits there are perhaps more in his favor. I don't think the wrongful termination will go anywhere—yeah it was a dick move to fire him literally the day before he retired, but based on the IG report, it was the correct decision. That's pretty strong evidence to overcome, and McCabe would have to prove (A) that the motive for his firing was *not* related to the IG report, (B) That this motive was improper or for a reason not allowed by law, and (C) That this wrongful termination caused him material harm. (C) is easy. (A) is very difficult without information amounting to an admission of the fact. (B) is a corollary to (A), which depends on how much information (A) has to support it. \n\nThis is an uphill legal battle for McCabe.

They need to remember it when they say that both parties are the same. They need to remember it when they decide that not voting or making a protest vote is going to stick it to the people in power. They need to remember it when the things they were hoping to get out of a Presidential candidate might not come to pass, but when that President won\'t be mass deporting groups of people who our government had previously pledged to protect, they\'re the right choice over the one who will kick 800k people back to countries they don\'t remember.\n\nThis is the moment here when you have to realize that you can\'t stay at home, sitting on your couch, deciding from your position of privilege as a citizen of the United States of America that you are "so above politics" that you don\'t need to go and make the right decision at the ballot box. Yes, sometimes the decisions that politicians make can hurt you. Sometimes it comes in the form of higher taxes or new regulations. Sometimes it comes in the form of eliminating jobs that have harmful impacts to the environment. But if you\'re voting for people that are threatening to take away people\'s access to healthcare, take away social security benefits from seniors and those about to retire, and people who want to deport your neighbors who have been in the country for over a decade when they had no decision about where they were born, you\'re on the wrong side of history. You\'re also on the wrong side of history if you decide to stay home and not vote because you\'re not getting your laundry list of things you personally want out of a candidate.\n\nI\'m sure I\'ll get some posts about this saying that I\'m wrong but you can save the comments. If you didn\'t vote in this past election for the person who wouldn\'t deport the Dreamers, go and find one of the 800k who are signed up in the program and explain to them why you voted against their interests.'

">Over the last few weeks, a number of women have come forward to talk about how they felt my actions had affected them. I was shocked. I was upset. But in responding to their claims, I also wanted to be respectful of that broader conversation. Because all women deserve to be heard and their experiences taken seriously. I think that was the right thing to do. I also think it gave some people the false impression that I was admitting to doing things that in fact I haven't done. Some of the allegations against me are simply not true. Others I remember very differently. I said at the outset that the ethics committee was the right venue for these allegations to be heard and investigated and evaluated on their merits. That I was prepared to cooperate fully and that I was confident in the outcome.\n\nThis quote is from Al Franken's resignation speech. We need to keep in mind that Al Franken did not resign from his senate position because he believed he was guilty of sexual misconduct. He resigned because he was pressured by his fellow colleagues. He maintains that he would have been cleared by an ethics investigation, which I think is the greatest shame of how we handled Franken's case. We already had the moral high ground when Franken willingly submitted himself to an ethics investigation, something Trump or Moore didn't do, but we abandoned Franken before giving him a chance to defend himself or a chance to confirm his accusers."

Tiffany is supposedly the black sheep of the family and reportedly has strings attached to her inheritance based on her and her mother's behavior towards DT. \n\nI'm not surprised at this, but TT has made a pretty good effort to not be involved in the whole shitshow her father is putting on, it's not really something we should be glomping on to with everything else going on in the world.

I believe that at this stage she does not need the Trump  wealth.\n\n\nAside from Trump's reference about not being as proud of Tiffany, I cringe at what other comments they have been exposed.\n\nWell, I think that she's got a lot of Marla, she's a really beautiful baby, and she's got Marla's legs.

'The President of the United States is going to tweet about hookers tomorrow'
'[Based on this contemporaneous article](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/us/stephen-bannon-donald-trump-national-security-council.html) it appears nearly certain that the redacted first head of state to call Trump was Putin. Of fucking course it was.\n\n> When Mrs. May said that she understood wanting a dialogue with Mr. Putin but stressed the need to be careful, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Flynn when the two were scheduled to speak.\n\n> **Mr. Flynn replied it was Saturday** — he had delayed it to fit in Mrs. May’s meeting for “protocol” as a United States ally, adding at length that Mr. Putin was impatient to chat.'
"Rachel Maddow asked James Comey tonight whether or not the intelligence agencies were protecting important national security information from getting to the Trump White House right from the beginning of the administration due to the knowledge of Michael  Flynn being possibly compromised, and James Comey said he couldn't answer that question. That response seriously gives me hope for the future of our country."
"Maddow just asked Comey about the Giuliani tip that he carted around  a few days before the election and the false leaks about the Clinton probe coming from the New York field office, which is said to be one of the driving factors for Comey sending that letter just before the election.  [This has been covered] (https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/fbi-leaks-hillary-clinton-james-comey-donald-trump) but surprisingly hasn't gotten much traction. \n\n\nMayor Giuliani will likely end up as a material witness in the Mueller Probe, which will be undoubtedly accelerated by the fact that he now on the President's legal team.\n"
"So instead of discrediting Comey...\n\n* Trump admitted to Comey that Flynn had poor judgement.  \n* Trump lied to Comey about not staying in Russia during his beauty pageant even though his top security guard testified that he did.  \n\nThere's more but these jumped right out.  \n"
'The fact that there is just so many posts defending trump in a sub which is usually better informed is just so incredibly telling. '
'Wow, these Russian trolls are dedicated. It’s not even 5:30 am there and they’re already up defending Donny. '

'I just wanted to add to the chorus of folks remarking about the volume of bots / trolls on this particular thread. This thread is exceptionally, exceptionally riddled with it. So, Comey is a target of Russian propaganda. Which means, Comey is likely both telling the truth and very trustworthy, and, perceived as a threat by Russia. '

And if he does this on behalf of his client, the candidate, that is a coordinated, illegal, in-kind contribution by Cohen for the purpose of influencing the election, of benefiting the candidate by keeping this secret.\n\n> *The payment Stormy Daniels received is the subject of complaints by watchdog groups to the Department of Justice and the Federal Election Commission, which Trevor Potter used to be chairman of.

Maybe we need this punch to the gut to show us how easily nepotism can be gotten away with to make sure it never happens again. Obviously, unspoken rules aren't sufficient anymore.\n\nEdit: I wasn't very clear. I'm referring to the issue of Ivanka and our lack of enforcement against nepotism."
"Remember that time in House of Cards when Underwood appointed his wife to be just an ambassador to a single country and she actually had to go through the approval process in congress and people were upset about the nepotism?\n\nYeah turns out he could have just made her secretary of state, circumvented Congress entirely, and the whole of the Republican party wouldn't have cared.\n\nTruth is stranger than fiction, I suppose.

"The problem is: Flake is still almost completely supportive of all of Trump's policy.\n\nHis only objection is the rhetoric.\n\nSo, Trump could be trying to implement all the same policy -- and if he would just be more discrete -- then Flake would be perfectly a-ok with it."
"Thankfully we have Jeff Flake to only vote for Trump's agenda [90% of the time.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/?ex_cid=rrpromo)"
"And he is one of them. Flake is not running again. All he has to do it is announce that he will serve the remainder of his term as an independent and will vote for a Majority Leader who will oversee Trump with teeth. It's a 51-49 Senate. He's have a huge amount of leverage.\n\nHe chooses not to. He is an enabler."

'he is not comparing just telling the truth'
"Then we'll build a wall around Trump Tower and make him pay for it.  Maybe make it into a nice facility that can house all of his fellow Russian collaborators.  Trump can have the penthouse cell."
"This is a great title, but how is it done? Republicans in Congress clearly don't care, and won't unless Trump fires Mueller (even then, John McCain will be 'very concerned' and then continue to vote for everything Trump wants). \n\nTrump thought being president meant his actions were untouchable, like a dictator would think. So far, the US is proving him right. \n\nAnd why would he think any differently? He won, despite admitting to sexual assault on tape, why couldn't he get away with colluding with the Russians? "
"I feel sorry for people who've invested so much into the 2016 election that they still can't bring themselves to accept that they lost."

"7 months in and the press is in full revolt.  guess that's a good sign"
'I\'d like to know who said it first:  \n\n**"Donald Trump is a weak man\'s idea of a strong man."**'
'Good lord, Acosta eviscerated him'
'Acosta moved on him like a bitch!'
"I like how Trump couldn't answer the questions and immediately left the room. I guess it's not surprising considering we've known he was a gigantic coward ever since that female pastor in Flint shut him down and he didn't say shit. It's so obvious he's an over-privileged pussy who's been surrounded by yes men his whole life and doesn't know what to do when someone confronts him."

"Yeah, Trump is an absolute shitstorm.  But CNN has hardly been on the side of the angels through this.  They gave Trump hours and hours of free coverage early in the run, cuz it was good television.  They have consistently employed Trump apologists (Lord, Kingston, Miller et all) who are paid to blindly support everything Trump, in the interest of faux conflict.  (Not much drama in an entire panel agreeing that Trump is, in fact, an idiot.)  They're loving this shit.  The collapse of American institutions may be a tragedy, but it makes for a damn fine business model."
"Facts First? [I'll just leave this here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDhqZSyP8fc)\n\nSeriously CNN is a joke and people who watch it come out even less informed then before they tuned in."
"Having the president attack individual news organizations weakens the First Amendment commitment to freedom of press, which protects us from fascism and dictatorship. You can hate CNN and still get why it's vital the president not do this. "

'*"There are few issues more important to the security of the United States than the potential spread of nuclear weapons, or the potential for even more destructive war in the Middle East. That’s why the United States negotiated the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in the first place.*\n\n*The reality is clear. The JCPOA is working – that is a view shared by our European allies, independent experts, and the current U.S. Secretary of Defense. The JCPOA is in America’s interest – it has significantly rolled back Iran’s nuclear program. And the JCPOA is a model for what diplomacy can accomplish – its inspections and verification regime is precisely what the United States should be working to put in place with North Korea. Indeed, at a time when we are all rooting for diplomacy with North Korea to succeed, walking away from the JCPOA risks losing a deal that accomplishes – with Iran – the very outcome that we are pursuing with the North Koreans.*\n\n*That is why today’s announcement is so misguided. Walking away from the JCPOA turns our back on America’s closest allies, and an agreement that our country’s leading diplomats, scientists, and intelligence professionals negotiated. In a democracy, there will always be changes in policies and priorities from one Administration to the next. But the consistent flouting of agreements that our country is a party to risks eroding America’s credibility, and puts us at odds with the world’s major powers.*\n\n*Debates in our country should be informed by facts, especially debates that have proven to be divisive. So it’s important to review several facts about the JCPOA.*\n\n*First, the JCPOA was not just an agreement between my Administration and the Iranian government. After years of building an international coalition that could impose crippling sanctions on Iran, we reached the JCPOA together with the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the European Union, Russia, China, and Iran. It is a multilateral arms control deal, unanimously endorsed by a United Nations Security Council Resolution.*\n\n*Second, the JCPOA has worked in rolling back Iran’s nuclear program. For decades, Iran had steadily advanced its nuclear program, approaching the point where they could rapidly produce enough fissile material to build a bomb. The JCPOA put a lid on that breakout capacity. Since the JCPOA was implemented, Iran has destroyed the core of a reactor that could have produced weapons-grade plutonium; removed two-thirds of its centrifuges (over 13,000) and placed them under international monitoring; and eliminated 97 percent of its stockpile of enriched uranium – the raw materials necessary for a bomb. So by any measure, the JCPOA has imposed strict limitations on Iran\'s nuclear program and achieved real results.* \n\n*Third, the JCPOA does not rely on trust – it is rooted in the most far-reaching inspections and verification regime ever negotiated in an arms control deal. Iran’s nuclear facilities are strictly monitored. International monitors also have access to Iran’s entire nuclear supply chain, so that we can catch them if they cheat. Without the JCPOA, this monitoring and inspections regime would go away.* \n\n*Fourth, Iran is complying with the JCPOA. That was not simply the view of my Administration. The United States intelligence community has continued to find that Iran is meeting its responsibilities under the deal, and has reported as much to Congress. So have our closest allies, and the international agency responsible for verifying Iranian compliance – the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).*\n\n*Fifth, the JCPOA does not expire. The prohibition on Iran ever obtaining a nuclear weapon is permanent. Some of the most important and intrusive inspections codified by the JCPOA are permanent. Even as some of the provisions in the JCPOA do become less strict with time, this won’t happen until ten, fifteen, twenty, or twenty-five years into the deal, so there is little reason to put those restrictions at risk today.*\n\n*Finally, the JCPOA was never intended to solve all of our problems with Iran. We were clear-eyed that Iran engages in destabilizing behavior – including support for terrorism, and threats toward Israel and its neighbors. But that’s precisely why it was so important that we prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Every aspect of Iranian behavior that is troubling is far more dangerous if their nuclear program is unconstrained. Our ability to confront Iran’s destabilizing behavior – and to sustain a unity of purpose with our allies – is strengthened with the JCPOA, and weakened without it.*\n\n*Because of these facts, I believe that the decision to put the JCPOA at risk without any Iranian violation of the deal is a serious mistake. Without the JCPOA, the United States could eventually be left with a losing choice between a nuclear-armed Iran or another war in the Middle East. We all know the dangers of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon. It could embolden an already dangerous regime; threaten our friends with destruction; pose unacceptable dangers to America’s own security; and trigger an arms race in the world’s most dangerous region. If the constraints on Iran’s nuclear program under the JCPOA are lost, we could be hastening the day when we are faced with the choice between living with that threat, or going to war to prevent it.*\n\n*In a dangerous world, America must be able to rely in part on strong, principled diplomacy to secure our country. We have been safer in the years since we achieved the JCPOA, thanks in part to the work of our diplomats, many members of Congress, and our allies. Going forward, I hope that Americans continue to speak out in support of the kind of strong, principled, fact-based, and unifying leadership that can best secure our country and uphold our responsibilities around the globe."*\n\n\\- President Barack Obama'

'> During the call, which Mr. Trump initiated on Aug. 9 from his New Jersey golf club, the president accused Mr. McConnell of bungling the health care issue. **He was even more animated about what he intimated was the Senate leader’s refusal to protect him from investigations of Russian interference in the 2016 election, according to Republicans briefed on the conversation.**'
"Man Trump is alienating senators so fast.\n\nI think he is too dense to realize that the senate is where the real power lies. Last night he trashed both GOP senators from Arizona and then praised three rinky-dink representatives from Arizona. \n\nAnd I'm sure him taking another opportunity to bash a war hero who is dying of brain cancer will go over great with his senate colleagues.  "
'This begs the (rhetorical) question of why he needs protection if he is indeed as innocent as he claims to be.'
"Trump thinks that everything he does is legal because he can't conceive of having to do anything differently than what comes naturally.\n\nThere are rules, sir, in your position.  And should you break those rules, you can be breaking the law, sir.  Asking someone in power to help you out with an independent investigation, sir, is one of those thing you cannot legally do, as it is unlawful. With your pattern of behavior: Desist. Seek counsel. Say little. Do less."

I get what they were doing:  there was a commitment made by the President to do 50/50 funding on this and they expected the funding.  Making this public ensures that they will get the funding in the upcoming bill.  It is a smart move by Amtrak.

'republican party in a nutshell'
'I have read online and heard in person TONS of anecdotal reports from American ex-pats, perpetual travelers, and the like, about the ubiquity of bribery across the world. Paying a bit extra "under the table" is basically an ingrained cultural norm in many foreign countries. People who have money are expected to give a bribe if they need something official done quickly and can\'t handle the uncertainty of trying to navigate a murky bureaucracy on their own. Usually I\'ve heard it in the context of travelers getting themselves and their belongings through chaotic border checkpoints, but it only makes sense that businesses might run into the same issues as they attempt to move goods and/or workers through borders. \n\nI\'m trying to imagine doing business in a country where bribery is a cultural practice and trying to negotiate a complex contract that relies on any number of regulatory approvals processes all coming together smoothly, *on a timeline,* **without** bribing anyone. \n\nI\'m no lover of Trump, but I think there might be more to this than the obvious "corrupt businessman Donald Trump advocating for corrupt businesses."'
'>  In 2012, Trump told CNBC that The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars US companies from using bribes for a competitive advantage, is a "horrible law" that stifles American businesses working abroad.\n\n> "It puts us at a huge disadvantage," he said. \n\nDo you know what else "puts [businesses] at a huge disadvantage?"\n\nEnvironmental protection laws. Sometimes laws put people into a "disadvantage" because they are ethically correct. Yes, it is FAR cheaper to dump your waste into streams/rivers. Yes, it does hurt your ability to compete with other businesses who still dump their waste cheaply.

That even the Media will want him to win in 2020. \n\nAside from his insane racist nationalistic policies that are dividing and destroying this country one has to wonder how his supporters can read something like this (assuming they can read) and not feel he is unable to hold the office of the Presidency based on his mental state. He clearly is unhinged. \n\nThe fact that millions of his supporters don't care shows how f---ked the US is. Trump is just a reflection of the avg white American really. The US is totally screwed. "
"The criticism of the NYT is ridiculous. For an impromptu interview in his golf club's dining room, I don't really care how confrontational the reporter is. \n\n\n\nI like to see reporters press him on facts, but it's not the only way to get newsworthy stories from an interview. Letting him talk freely in a comfortable environment is a tactic that works.\n\nThat said, I have no experience with Alzheimer's in my family, but I believe those who do when they say they see the same behaviors in Trump."
'If you are in the military and you want to fly, you have to pass physicals from a military flight surgeon.\nIf you want to be commander-in-chief and be able to push the big red button, you should have to pass neurologic exams from a neutral doctor, and they have to have consequences (removal if you fail), which effectively means "results made public."\nCongress needs to pass a law before several hundred million people die.'
'I can\'t help but think that Trump knows that the FBI is going to end his presidency and his only hope for staying out of prison is to suddenly become senile. Is he going to show up in court in a hospital bed like Hosni Mubarak? Jeff "I Can\'t Recall" Sessions seems to be trying out this tactic too. '
'> SCHMIDT: Do you think we’ve been too soft on China on North Korea?\n> \n> TRUMP: No, look, I like China, and I like **him** a lot.'
'I came to the comments section bc I don’t feel like reading this today'
"I'll be honest, I don't really see a difference in that interview with anything else he's done the past few years. "
'> And eventually, probably six months before the election, they’ll be loving me because they’re saying, “Please, please, don’t lose Donald Trump.” O.K.\n\nlmao. okay.'
"My Nan had Alzheimer's, rest her soul, and I see in Trump what I saw in her. Though when my Nan went through it we didn't know how it was going to end, and we certainly didn't let her run for any sort of public office."
"To be quite honest, I don't know how you came to elect someone like him. Maybe you were drunk, high or both. Regardless, every day I have to remind myself that the man is *actually* the President of the United States...\n\nI thought you gave your all with Bush Jr. but apparently you still had some more in you... I hope that's the last drop of insane you'll be oozing.\n\nGoing forward, if possible, get your shit together. A future without an apocalypse would be nice. There are other countries which are not the US who would very much like to go on existing.\n\nThx."
'I was going to comment...\n\n"Every headline on /r/politics looks like it came straight from Enquire."\n\nThen I looked at where the headline came from.'
"The only question is, how much \n\nGood chance, when the story of Trump's time in the whitehouse is told, \n\nTrump might not have been able to remember what happened yesterday "
'The NYT article that Chait cites is **bananas**. His cover story is laughable. The Kremlin’s claim that they don’t know him is unbelievable — especially in the context of his claimed cover story.\n\nThis guy seems extremely important.'
'>Mr. Akhmetshin, a Washington resident, has told reporters that he just happened to be lunching with Ms. Veselnitskaya in Manhattan that day when she spontaneously invited him to the meeting with the president’s son, son-in-law Jared Kushner and Mr. Manafort. He did not explain why she wanted him there.\n\nLiterally nothing suspicious with that alibi'
'" almost definitely" \n\n'
'Almost Definitely .....really now? one is not the other....almost = close but not quite ...definitely = without a doubt or without question.....and those two words should never go together. ever.'
'"Almost definitely" \n\n60% of the time he is a spy everytime'
'Has anyone noticed that the number of Trump "supporters" have skyrocketed online since Bannon left the White House. I wonder if he left in order to stage mass astroturfing without the liability that comes with being part of White House staff.'
'"Almost" only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades'
"almost definitely? it's like an oxymoron "
'We cant prove hes a spy, so we wont say he is, but putting spy in headlines sure does sell huh. '
'"That Russian guy" good job, y\'all got em this time. '
'Lol this headline'
'Almost definitely? 100%? Pinky swear?'
'This article is almost definitely worth reading.. '
'If my aunt Almost definitely had balls she would Almost definitely be my uncle. '
'"almost definitely"\n\nYep he certainly might just be maybe the guy who allegedly did that spy stuff'
"How's does anyone read a headline like this and then proceed to take the article and author seriously?"
'Didn\'t read past "Almost Definitely a Spy".\n\nIs this article written by a teenager?'
'"Almost" definitely. In other words, they don\'t know, and Trump is innocent.'
'I really hope that Trump gets impeached over this. Every action that he has taken, every word he has twittered, and every appearance that he has shown on the media has desecrated the Presidency. '
"I didn't know this bet you know who most definitely does? MUELLER."
'Almost definitely likely probably spy. '
"Next you're going to tell me that the rich put some of that money into offshore accounts. "
"My company's CEO announced a bonus and raise freeze for 2018 this past January. He then went on to talk about his house in NY. Our headquarters is in MI, where his other house is."
'Commondreams.org is certainly not a reputable source, I mean just look at the title, assuredly the fine people at /r/politics will know this is just an attempt at ridiculous progressive circlejer....\n\n"2,942 points (94% upvoted)"\n\nOh.'
"Yeah, trickle-down is a thing alright, except it's Russian hooker piss."
"I'm 33 and haven't worked in so long I'm completely.... lost.  Married with a kid I hustle 2nd hand stores and sell on internet.  I filed taxes for the first time in 8 years with my wife and newborn and the IRS took the $4800 return (my wife AGI was 4200, I had 0 - so we only made $4200 on the books last year.. yet with hurricane and baby we qualified for that)  and because I took out some student loan in 2004 to go to an online university that lasted 6 months and the loan process was numbers on the computer screen I never saw... \n\nYeah.  Just... Stuff like this doesn't really matter anymore.  I know I'm not alone.  The gap is growing.  Over half of you live paycheck to pay check, 85% of you could not come up with $2,500 cash if given a 24 hour notice... and 94% of all arrests end up in conviction.\n\nBlah.  "
'I get close to $100 a month back and so does my wife. Do you think we are complaining? Absolutely not. Unless the point of this post is to give workers an even bigger tax break then yeah I’m in full support but this sub is normally pushing fo me to give the “corrupt” government more money so I’m skeptical lol'
"Glad we're not referring to it as his tax plan anymore, but instead what it really is, his tax scam."
'Atleast my crumbs are tax free right? RIGHT?! \n\n*Crumb Tax introduced to senate floor \n\nD:\n\nEdit: words are hard '
'I work for one of the biggest firms in the world and anecdotally can confirm. We posted net profits recently in the billions, for just the 1st quarter. I\'ve been around long enough to recognize the pattern; we post billions in profits throughout the year but each year due to "spotty" or "poor" firm performance we can\'t even keep up with cost of living increases and rarely see a bonus. And then we get the "we\'re lucky to have a job" schtick that just pisses me off each year.\n\nNeedless to say I am in the process of getting a degree in hopes of a career change because I can\'t do this much longer.'
'Strange, US just reported the largest wage increase since 2009.  If these are crumbs what did we have during the last administration?\n\nhttp://money.cnn.com/2018/02/02/news/economy/january-jobs-report-2018/index.html'
'tax the rich, tax corporations, regulate wall street. '
'This seems like an unbiased news source...  I\'d expect to see this alongside an article from like "Russia Today" or some crap like that'
'You guys can posture if you like, but I work in manufacturing and just got a bonus for 10% of my yearly pay. And my company is adding 150 more jobs. And has invested $80M in our little town in the past year alone. 2.5B is not really that much money in the US economy. '
'I have ten employees. Under these tax changes, there will be no way for me to show a profit, or retain all my staff, in 2018. The new tax laws literally destroy small retail. So effectively, in fact, that it seems they were written to accomplish that very task.'
'You mean to tell me the GOP sponsored tax bill favors corporations and millionaires over the middle class?!'
"I know my company is paying more in taxes due to cash being repatriated from offshore.  Since we are multinational and have some European C-level staff there was spin that this was bad, but in private they are happy because there's more cash to buy back stock. "
'I heard a guy bragging about his tax return and he said "...and the lady told me if trump\'s tax laws had passed, I would have gotten about \n $1,000 more."\n\nlook at Walmart, they gave employees, *who met all the criteria, a hefty $1,000 bonus. then went and shut stores down and laid people off. \n\nThey take home **billions** of dollars. \n\nThey\'re the real winners.'
"To those claiming the extra 100 a month I  their paychecks isn't just crumbs let me share my position. My family makes about $20,000 annually. Wife is a full time student with our first baby due September. I work full time and am in grad school. 100 a month is 1200 a year. One grad level class costs 2000. So yeah, it's crumbs because it doesn't even cover enough to pay for one class. And I didn't actually get a raise in my work. So I don't even get crumbs. Yay..."

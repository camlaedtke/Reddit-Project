Trump praises health care of Nambia, a nonexistent African country
'A bill with 18% public approval got 94% support from Republican senators.'
'Three Republicans voted country over party, and they saved my mother\'s life in the process.\n\nSenators John McCain, Susan Collins, and Lisa Murkowski voted "No" and the bill that would effectively strip 15 million people of health care and raise premiums for the remaining insured by an average of 20% every year for the next decade failed by a tally of 49-51.\n\nAnd my mother kept her health insurance. And I openly wept with joy.'
'Show the dissenting Republicans love tomorrow.   They deserve to have their courage rewarded!'
'McCain\'s vote, pretty badass. Walks up, out of turn, holds his hand out... Thumbs down and "no!" Looks at McConnell, walks away. Maverekt https://twitter.com/bubbaprog/status/890807095024603137 '
"I'm glad Heller voted Yes for this so he can pay for his decision. Spineless."
'[So great that John McCain is coming back to vote. Brave - American Hero! Thank you John.](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/889798407228989441)\n\n-Donald J. Trump, July 25 '
"Credit where credit is due. McCain really surprised here, I'm thinking trump makes a tweet about his mental capability in the morning"
"I know everyone's on the McCain train right now, but it's really Murkowski and Collins who are the true heroes.  Their votes were steady and consistent.  They never played politics with their constituents' healthcare.  They are the real heroes of the GOP right now."
'I know the focus will be on McCain, but let\'s not forget about the two ladies whom held firm throughout this entire process. I don\'t think you realize how much pressure was put on Murkowski, not to mention how much "pork" that was promised, yet she chose State & Country over party. Unlike someone like Heller, who sold out his vote to big donors. '
'Thank you McCain. You saved a lot of ppl tonight.  '
"While McCain's was the surprise (dare I say, Maverick-esque!) vote that'll get all the attention, Collins and Murkowski deserve our gratitude for sticking to their word.  Every one of their votes was crucial!"
"Awesome speech from Schumer, the Legislative branch should seize the opportunity to reclaim it's former standing with the Executive Branch being a fucking dumpster fire."
"I am very glad that McCain voted the way he did, and I thank him for it, but let's remember the real heroic Republicans who fought this bill from the get-go: *Collins* and *Murkowski.*"

"As a transperson I've been pretty calm about all this, whether or not I should be. But this got me. The excuses of the administration are very clearly a farce. I'm not going to react how they want and expect me to. I'm gonna *make* myself welcome in this country and I'll act and express myself however I god damn please. This shit right here is why pride is necessary."
"Hallo Mr President. \n\nI are 6 years old my name is Matthew. You are my favorite President i ever meet. You are so great and so is USA. Why do you let Jeff Sessions and Reins Preebus treat you so badly? They are the meanest people i ever saw on tv and i can't believe you haven't told them you're fired!! Please make them go away Mister President i am counting on you. \n\ni Love you,\nMatthew"
"I don't know how true this is because it was told to me by someone works with the military, but it's not the costs of providing the care so much as the means. Apparently, trans people who don't receive hormone supplements can (and have in the past) become a liability if they're not able to maintain a consistent regime. Much like a diabetic or any other person who needs routine medication to maintain their ability to function would be barred from serving. \n\nIf anyone can help me confirm this it'd be much appreciated because if this is true it would make sense why this is now being debated."
"Sure, but don't let facts catalyze an underestimation of just [how much social conservatives blood boils](http://www.redstate.com/sweetie15/2017/07/27/former-navy-seal-transgender-activist-protests-trumps-transgender-policy-wait.../) over the thought of trans people receiving medical care or be treated like a human being.   They happily dismiss fiscal conservatism when it allows them to push their fascist social conservative (i.e. theological) world-view on others.  "
"This has nothing to do with cost.  It's about what the alt right sees as ethical and moral.  \n\n-Providing health care prescribed by a doctor for people who fight to keep us free: UNETHICAL/IMMORAL. \n\n-The president using federal funds to pay his own company for him to take weekends off at an expensive resort, while also having national security meetings in an unsecure environment:  ETHICAL/MORAL/ACCEPTABLE/ENCOURAGED.  \n\nThe Republicans can either separate themselves from this by publicly repudiating and removing the president,  or they can be branded as the party that caused it to happen. "
'The Instigator in Chief successfully brought this to the forefront and created a nice little wedge issue to keep the country divided and distracted.\n\nHe won this round. '
"The RAND study for transgendered care costs in the military is not even close to accurate...it was ordered to only look at active duty troops. TriCare is the military health care plan and it covers over 10,000,000 people. This decision doesn't just affect the 1.3 million active duty troops but would change coverage for all 10 million members. It also only looked at the specific medical cost of having the sex change surgery done...they didn't use any counseling costs, hormone treatment for years etc. "

'To quote from an author (Michael Parenti) who should be read more:\n\n>in any given year the federal government hands out more than $100 billion to big business in price supports, payments in kind, export subsidies and export promotions, subsidized insurance rates, new plants and equipment, marketing services, and irrigation and reclamation programs. Additional billions are spent on loan guarantees and debt-forgiveness, including the recent erasure of most of the megabillion-dollar debt owed by the nuclear industry for uranium enrichment services provided by the government.\n\n>Welfare for the rich is the name of the game. Over the years, the federal government has sold or leased to private firms, at fees of 1 to 10 percent of true market value, billions of dollars worth of gold, coal, oil, and mineral reserves, along with grazing and timberlands – all of which are the property of the people of the United States. The government has provided billions of dollars to rescue giant corporations like Chrysler, Lockheed, Continental Illinois, and over $500 billion to bail out savings-and-loan institutions. The government distributes billions in research and development grants, mostly to corporations that are then permitted to keep the patents and market the products for profit. The government develops whole new industries, takes all the risks, absorbs all the costs, then hands the industries over to private companies for private gain – as has been done with aerospace, nuclear energy, electronics, synthetics, space communications, mineral exploration, and computer systems.\n\n>The government permits billions in public monies to remain on deposits in banks without collecting interest. It tolerates overcharging by firms with which it does business. It awards highly favorable contracts to large companies along with long-term credits and lowered tax assessments amounting to additional billions each year. And through nonenforcement, it has turned the antitrust laws into a dead letter.\n\n>In regard to all this corporate largess, no mainstream commentator asks, ”Where are we going to get the money to pay for all these things?” an inevitable question when social programs are proposed. Nor do they seem concerned that the corporate recipients of this largesse will run the risk of having their moral fiber weakened by dependency on government handouts. In sum, the myth of a self-reliant, free-market, trickle-down economy is just that, a myth. In almost every enterprise, government provides business with supports, protections, and opportunities for private gain at public expense.\n\n([Source](http://b-ok.org/book/933776/bd2c92))\n\n([Another, more recent book of his](http://b-ok.org/book/1168104/924459))'

'What I don\'t understand is why there is so little focus upon why so many other Republicans were in favor of such unpopular legislation. Is there any doubt about the answer to that question? And what can the country do to take back ownership of democracy from the billionaire donor class that so obviously owns ~~the Republican party~~ both major parties?\n\nEdit: Who did the Occupy Wallstreeters vote for? Those protests arose from a huge wave of underlying frustration with power politics (outsized influence of billionaires). The majority were undoubtedly Sanders supporters although I suspect some (many?) subsequently found more in common with the "blow up the system" rhetoric of Trump than Clinton. Obviously not much of a choice. But my point is that I suspect a fair percentage of current Trump supporters believed in the same things as Occupy Wallstreet; and, if the non-racist portion of them can get behind a real movement, maybe there\'s actually hope that 2020 can bring more than just ousting Trump - and actually result in revolutionary, not just evolutionary, change.\n\nEdit-2: As for those defending the DNC and noting the support of Soros and other "benevolent" billionaires, I can only say: My democratic rights shouldn\'t be limited to a choice between a "mean billionaire class" or a "benevolent billionaire class". It\'s about time neither Koch nor Soros have the "power" to pick up the phone and successfully get any Congressman, Dept Head, or even the President on the phone within minutes - when nobody on reddit can come close to that kind of influence.

"I am tired of Republicans blaming the Dems for passing the ACA without a single Republican vote. IT WAS NOT FOR TRYING. The ACA starts off as a Republican plan, Mitt Romney's plan in Massachusetts. Then they had hearings and took input for 18 months. They allowed various stake holders, many of them Republican leaning organizations (health care insurers, hospitals, doctors groups), to help shape the bill. But for solid political reasons the Republicans decided to not vote for the bill, to be the opposition party, to have a good political topic to hold against the Dems. But the Dems were really trying."

It\'s "impressive" that a US Senator listened to an expert with an open mind? It\'s so unheard of that we\'re calling it out now. We really need to kick some of these motherfuckers out of office. '
"Of course we should praise Susan Collins for voting against the repeal, but that doesn't mean she's automatically a good Senator. Letting a politician off because they fed you a bone (that was yours in the first place) is exactly what's wrong with our voters these days. Of this is the greatest democracy and country on earth, you better demand proof of that. "
"Today's GOP - driven by special interest and intense political pressure to 'do the right thing by party', not debate on the facts-based merits of policies that would help the American people. It's gotten to this point where they almost had complete consensus to pass a bill they themselves hated and had public support in the teens. They are fueled by spite alone these days.  I hope their buddies in the House are reminded on their vacations not to gloat that no one wanted that mish-mash piece of shit bill either, that they tried to pass off to the senate as the best they could do with a near super majority."

"Keep in mind, this IS ShareBlue and the bill, while not as good as Obamacare, is not as bad as it's making it out to be. The issue is, it gives the option to states to decide whether to keep or ditch Obamacare. On the bad side, this means loss of Obamacare, but on the plus side, Democrats can turn this and wreck the Republicans in 2018 when running for governor. A lot of people who liked the coverage would vote for the governor (aka a Democrat) who said 'we're keeping it!' Rest assured, as of now, I'll bet CA and OH will opt to keep Obamacare in place so people in those states are safe.

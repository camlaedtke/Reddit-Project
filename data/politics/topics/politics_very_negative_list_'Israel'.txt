'"Jared Kushner failed to disclose" would make a damn fine Cards Against Humanity prompt'
'Jared Kushner failed to disclose that he is a morally bankrupt individual'
'How. The. Fuck. Is. He. Even. Still. In. The. White. House. \n\nEdit: My theory on why he hasn’t been indicted yet is because Mueller is leaving him there for the Carmelo Anthony effect. Kid just fucks up over and over and over and causes more problems. '
'It\'s actually annoying me now to read "failed to disclose".\n\nHe didn\'t fail, he just chose not to.'
'The failure to disclose _again_ just seems like another “add it to that security breach pile over there” but that he failed to disclose that he is _an active participant_ in the Israel-Palestine conflict when tasked with negotiating a settlement between the Israelis and Palestinians is _crazy making._\n\nIt’s bad enough to appoint an American Jew to this task - we are not exactly neutral parties with regard to Israel - but to put an American Jew _who is funding settlements_ in charge is just like all of Trumps’ US cabinet appointments, active sabotage of their functions. It’s breathtaking and we have lost what little influence we had with the Palestinians. The US may never be able to regain any credibility as any kind of disinterested party. '
'Imagine what he\'ll be shown to have failed to disclose a few months down the line.\n\nI can see the headlines now:\n\n>"Jared Kushner failed to disclose that he is a Martian from the underground city of Zorg."'
'This fucker is into a lot of shady shit. '
'Jared Kushner failed to disclose he is a reptilian shapeshifter trying to enslave humanity. '
"Isn't there a point where he just has to go to jail without passing go? I mean seriously, any of us would have suffered consequences from this level of contempt for the law far before this point."
"Instead of 'failed to disclose' they should start reporting it as 'failed to conceal'."
'Ok stop me if I sound a bit /r/ conspiracy... \n\nFlynn asked diplomat Kislyak to veto the Egyptian UN resolution on Israeli Illegal developments. \n\nKushner failed to disclose backing a company that builds said type pf developments.\n\nHuh\n'
'Jared failed to disclose something?\n\nNo! Impossible! Unpresidented! \n\nThere must be some mix up. '
'They’re not “illegal”- they’re against “international law”, which many countries including the US “breaks” all the time. \n\nAccording the international law, waging any war at all without the approval of the U.N. Security Council is illegal. America has done it about 20 times over the past 20 years. President Clinton broke international law to attack Iraq and Yugoslavia. President Obama broke international law by attacking in Syria. Bush and Obama both broke international law with their multitude of drone assassinations. Bush lead violations of international law with regards to the “illegal” detentions and torture of terrorists he captured. Some munitions that the US uses like white phosphorous incendiary munitions and cluster bombs are “illegal” under international law. \n\nSo give me a break the Israeli settlements were only made to be against international law because in the Oil Age the Arab countries wielded too much diplomatic power. Now, with the end of the oil age, we no longer have to appease these terrible Arab countries and can make decisions based on morality, such as a decision to defend the one state in the Middle East where non-Muslims can live in peace and prosperity vs the 22 Arab countries in the Middle East where nobody besides Muslim Arabs have full and equal rights. '
'Technically not illegal, but very immoral. I generally want the best for israel(and the Palestinians on s separate note) but this is just the dumbest most unnecessary thing they do. If they completely stopped the new settlements, their international reputation would be way better. But the right wing Israelis don’t want defined borders so they can continue on their holy war that most of the country could not care less about.'
'“Jared Kushner failed to disclose _______” is like the new Trump administration Mad Libs. '
'The entire Trump family seems to be extremely forgetful. Worryingly, considering that Kushner is now also afflicted, this appears to be contagious rather than genetic. I expect numerous "I do not recall" statements in the nearby future.'

"> Make no mistake: If the people who wrote this bill were proud of it, they wouldn't be forcing this vote in the dead of night.\n\n_Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, 2009_"
"Question: How long until I have to worry about the next GOP attempt to screw up insurance? \n\nEdit: For those of you still coming to this. It appears that it is dead for at least a year. Because this was a budget reconciliation vote it only needed a simple 51 vote majority to pass. Now that it has failed a 60 vote majority will be needed to pass a new healthcare bill.\n\nSide note: It appears that if McCain hadn't voted for the debate to proceed then he could have potentially been replaced due to health concerns and the vote could have passed."
'John McCain voted yes the other day just so he could fly across the country (with brain cancer) to fuck Donald Trump in the ass'
"The story is not what McCain did, it's what he had to do at 2 am because his own party was insistent om passing anything.\n\nNever forget these moments;\n\n- McCain said the bill was terrible but he'd vote for it if he felt sure Ryan wouldn't pass it outright. Same for Graham.\n- they received a tepid assurance and the House declared Martial Law to repeal some rules and fast track the bill\n- Not a single Republican mentioned the CBO score or cared.\n- McConnell was so certain of his victory that he called Pence down.\n- McConnell called Democrats obstructionists for asking bills to be ready and slowing nominations... The man who stopped Merrick Garland for a year and held up Obama noms for years on end.\n- even at just 50 votes needed and with a majority, McConnell still failed.\n- Conservative Dems we're never even in play! Any Congress watchers know that's a pretty crazy thing.\n- McConnell still forced vulnerable Republicans to vote No even after the bill failed, like Heller.\n\n\nThey came at 2 am for your healthcare, fully aware the bill they were passing would be an unmitigated disaster. They shut down proteata, ended town halls, and ignored polls. They risked everything with endless ammunition against the for midterms. Just to do something they KNEW would raise cost and remove people from healthcare.\n\nBut the constituent voice still stopped them.\n\nNot Trump gets a turn. Let's see what he tries to break and see if people are paying attention.\n\nEdit: on mobile, so sorry you gotta live with the typos."
"I don't care that there are nine versions of this on r/politics right now. You're all getting upvotes! Fuck yes, we survive another day!"
'https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/890816249373966336:\n\n"McCain leaving the Capitol asked why he voted NO: \'I thought it was the right thing to do.\' "\n\nY\'all need to cut this guy some slack, he did the right thing when it counted most.'
"Trumps gonna tweet that McCains brain cancer caused him to be crazy and vote 'no'."
"I am so god damn hard right now, and I don't even have to worry about going to the hospital if it lasts over 4 hours!"
'suck it mitch\n\nyou goddamn turtle'
'Tfw you finally control all three branches of the government and you fail to repeal a bill after 50 attempts and 7 years of constantly telling Americans how terrible it is.'
'You all owe McCain an apology. \n\nSome of this shit was disgraceful. \n\nBut the Donald is being worse right now, to your credit. '
'The guy behind McConnell looks like he was gonna cry. So sad not being able to take healthcare away from millions. \n\nRepublicans are rotten '
'The broadcast of this was the first of its kind I have ever actually watched. That Enzi guy is a real piece of shit. I can not believe he refused to answer a single question. He just rambled on and read shit from that book. Fuck that guy.  \n  \nI hope you folks from Wyoming show this shit stain how much he sucks.'

"It's a nonsensical argument to begin with. Why are we looking at the entirety of their healthcare costs? Every soldier has healthcare costs. What amount of money is spent on healthcare for transgender soldiers that only they need and not any other group? Probably a hell of a lot less than 8 million. If they used that number, it would show how weak their argument is. "
'I don\'t want to hear we can\'t afford anything in this country. Ever again. Not since what I saw in 2008 when Wall Street shat the bed and Congress forked over 800 **billion** dollars in something like 72 hours.\n\nI\'m not looking for a "was it right or was it wrong that we bailed out those companies?" - I don\'t give a shit what anyone thinks about the wrongness or rightness of what was done. The point is it **did** happen, outside of right or wrong. If enough of us truly wanted something, if there was that pressure to our politicians for something, we would have it. Single Payer healthcare, better bridges, roads, schools, less privatization and more "public-ization" (for lack of a better word). Whatever. \n\nThe cost of this stuff, when presented from the "top" down to the rest of us living down here in the world is done to make us feel like we are greedy for wanting more/better out of our short time on this brutal, miserable, planet. It\'s just another way to punch down from those who are rich and powerful and if results in some of the working class internalizing that, believing it, and then telling other members of the working class that we are asking for too much...well, that\'s just gravy then.'
'Not to toot my own horn, but the moment I saw the Rand study that placed costs at between 2 and 8 million(or 1 to 4 Mar-a-Lago trips),  I immediately pointed this out to a friend. So any claim about it being about cost is immediately bullshit. \n\nIt was never about costs or integration concerns, it was to stir up his base. I am not sure how effective it has been, but it was always purely political.'
"Trump's reversal of the decision to allow trans-gendered people into the military has absolutely nothing to do with politics. In fact I'm sure Trump doesn't care too ways about it. No, this was purely an act of revenge - all part of Trump trying to dismantle EVERYTHING that Obama accomplished. All we've been witnessing the past 7 months is a very petty, childish man trying to one-up the one black guy that wronged him."
"It's not about saving money, and never was.\n\nIt's about bigotry, racism, sexism, homophobia. "
"It's not about cost. Assume he's lying about literally everything and each topic of discussion is about intentionally manipulating the narrative to detract from important matters like treason. It's all smoke and mirrors designed to get us riled up about something while he and his evil minions operate in the dark on other matters."
'for a country with recruiting problems, and increasing hostility worldwide, it seems kind of silly to eliminate anyone who can pass basic and wants to serve'
'this is fucking pathetic.  \nFuck this dude, fuck him to hell.'
"Obama family travel cost taxpayers at least [$100,104,459.53](http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-trump-administration-air-travel-costs-3-58-million/) during his two terms, and he maintained the trans ban for 7.5 years of his presidency. \n\nBut that won't get gilded...  In fact, it will get downvoted, because that's what happens to facts here. \n\nHow's that piss dossier treating you guys?"
"This is completely just a means to try to inflame the culture war as a distraction from the dumpster fire that is the rest of what's going on w/ the administration.  While trans rights are important and shouldn't be ignored, liberals should be careful to not let this distract too much from continuing to ratchet the pressure on the health care debate and the Russia investigation."
"Every day is some new horror with this guy. All distractions, but they all matter, you can't even begin to focus on fighting one thing because there's always another one... Trump and all his supporters and enablers sicken me to my core."
'This ban was never about cost. Trump needs a distraction and knows how easily mainstream media is distracted. Plus it helps sure up his base which largely hates LGBT people. '
"This decission wasn't truely about the cost guys, c'on. We spend money on stupid bullshit all the time.. the military spends more on viagra.. viagra.. why is the military even spending money on viagra???"
'Jail this fucker before bankrupt America.'
"How come no one talks about the other military restrictions? I can't join because I wear hard contact lenses. There's a list of a thousand other things that forbid you from joining."
"[But he said he wouldn't have any time to golf he'd be so busy working his ass off for the American people!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claPetUPO7s)\n\nAlso I fucking *love* how he just randomly veers off topic with random tangents like a lunatic. "
'I was fairly neutral about politics and trump but his whole trans ban damn made me strongly dislike this joke '
"You mean it's really about Republican fear and hatred of anything they don't know or understand?  Never. "
"No fucking shit. You're not being fiscally responsible by making a big deal out of 0.0013% of the military members maybe costing a lot for medical while taking million dollar vacations every weekend. Republicans, again, are lying to themselves. They like this because they hate trans people almost as much as they hate America."

"'Bloody sick children, refusing to put the hard work in to pay for their own medical bills. Expecting everything to just be handed to them. Sponging, entitled bastards, the lot of them. Do you know how many CEOs are having to charter jets they cannot afford to buy outright - because of these miserable, sickly children? It breaks my heart, it really does. People talk about creating a 'fairer' society, well, we're starting here, with the CEOs denied their jet-planes by fucking whinging poor people and their sick fucking kids.' - Sen. Hatch."
"It's time to shut the fucking country down.  We the people need to end this shit.  Politicians won't do it for us.  We need to take to the streets and take the country back.  It's far past time we march on Washington."
'Anyone who promotes self greed at the expenses of others lives deserve the death sentence.'
"Watch his actual speech. Click on the article and watch the fucking speech.\n\nRemember that he's voting in tax breaks for golf course owners and private plane owners and the ultra-wealthy who have more than $11,000,000 to hand to their children....when Hatch speaks. He's talking about LOW INCOME KIDS who have serious health problems. Are these people even *human?*\n\nI am literally in despair at this point. What the fuck. How in the fuck. What is happening."
'Pressure is building on the fault lines of this country.  This callous disregard for common decency is yet another push toward a seismic shift.  '

"Is America waiting for their children to be dead to apply self-defense against those killing them? Because that's exactly what they're doing here.

'Tthe US\' current descent into the normalization of amorality, greed, outright lies and criminality is democracy\'s death by a thousand cuts. It reminds me of something Milton Mayer wrote:\n\n>"You are saying that this must lead to this, and you canâ€™t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you donâ€™t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end?[...]\n\n>"You see," my colleague went on, "one doesnâ€™t see exactly where or how to move. Believe me, this is true. Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow.[...]\n\n>But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. Thatâ€™s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked. [...] But of course this isnâ€™t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. [...]\n\n\nI don\'t know where this is going, just like the colleague from Milton Mayer\'s story. But here you have a US senator who thinks children with poor parents should just die of cancer or influenza or a ruptured appendix or a car accident.\n\nIf advocating for the deaths of American children (whose only common trait is poverty) is the "beginnings", what do you surmise is the end? \n\nAnd how can this guy be so brazen to say this â€“ as if he has never to worry about democratic election?'
'This level of willful indifference and greed is pure evil. '
'These are just the worst people.'
'Hatch has a luxury suite waiting for him in Hell'
'Honestly, can someone explain to me how this isnt ignoring these children\'s basic human rights?\n\nYou have the right stating \n\n> "Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.\n> \n> â€”\u2009Article 6.1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights"\n\nSo how is this not breaching that? These kids have no way to pay for these things themselves. They may be lucky and have rich parents or parents who can afford a good insurance plan but for most people in the US if your kid is diagnosed with some kind of severe illness thats just the end of you financially. \n\nHealthcare costs too much and these kids have no way of getting what they need if there family can\'t afford it and I\'m sure there have been many children who have died because they couldn\'t get the proper care because its just impossible for a normal middle/poor family to afford it. \n\nIt has nothing to do with being lazy or not wanting to work for it at this point. Even if you arent lazy and work your ass off so many people cant afford proper health care. In what world is it "Libural" thinking to want to take care of other people and help sick people? \n\nIts bullshit the Republicans try and act like they are the christian family values party when they constantly fuck people over, treat people like shit, exploit people, ignore the sick and needy, and make life 1000% harder on families who work their asses off to give their loved ones the best life they can. \n\nThis country makes me fucking sick. First world country my ass. No first world country treats their citizens like this. '

"I really wish the media stopped framing this as just an issue for the poor.  I'm in the middle class and got health insurance because of the ACA (I have pre-existing conditions and I'm self-employed).  \n\nThis isn't just about the poor.  In fact, it's more about people like myself than it is about the poor.  From both sides of the aisle, and even the media, the middle class truly is forgotten in all of this.  \n\nEDIT: Thank you for the gold. \n\nEDIT 2:  I should add that I feel deeply for those who are negatively affected by the ACA.  It's hard to accept that the same piece of legislation that has helped so many, is the very thing that is driving so many people into financial ruin; or worse.  Our politicians on both sides have been failing us on this issue for a long, long time now. \n\n\n"
'When it was announced that McCain had brain cancer, most-every post I saw was bleeding-hearting for the guy along the lines of, "well, I don\'t agree with his politics, but he\'s a war hero and served his nation and I wish him the best".\n\nMy sympathies were instead for the single mother of three in her 40s who is also dying of brain cancer who doesn\'t have a senators health coverage and wealth, who needs Obamacare to have a chance at seeing her kids grow up, marry, and have children of their own.\n\nJohn McCain is killing her. He\'s a selfish "Fuck you, I got mine!" republican like all other selfish "fuck you, I\'m getting mine" republicans.\n\nHe\'s a piece of shit. I\'ve got zero fucks to give him.'
"I'm going to get crushed for this, but let me just say this about John McCain. He was shot down when flying over Hanoi, Vietnam and became a prisoner of war. One year after his imprisonment, his father was able to negotiate an early release. McCain refused because he didn't want to receive preferential treatment compared to other prisoners who had been imprisoned for a longer period of time. He spent another four and a half years being tortured as a prisoner of war.\n\nHe is an American hero and he is a patriot. \n\nWhen he flew to the Senate and voted the way he did, I was initially disappointed as well. But then he ripped into his colleagues on the Senate floor. He made it clear the bills that had been floated would not get his vote and called for a return to order. He asked for healthcare to go through the traditional debate/committee process so that the final product would have at least some bipartisan support. \n\nHe voted to proceed, not to take away anyone's healthcare. I suspect the reason was two-fold: it gave him a chance to speak to a captive audience (even the President waited for him to finish) and it gives him political points at home when he returns. For the voters who want to see the ACA gone, he will be able to tell them he voted to proceed so that the proposed bills could get a fair vote before returning to the order he called for. "
"That's not what happened. I'm a fan of the ACA, not a fan of McCain but this is the problem with the political discourse in this country. Yes, many of us would agree that his opposition to the ACA is shitty but frame it correctly. We don't need to make him look like an anti-human with no soul. He doesn't like the way healthcare is being implemented, he's not trying to rip insurance away from poor people. I'm so tired of the outrage culture. Someone disagrees with something so that means they must be a terrible human being who hates poor people? No. Many people act as if this is the only way to administer healthcare and if you disagree with that method well then you're a terrible human being. That and it's not just poor people that benefit from the ACA. Framing it that way makes it feel like a handout thus giving the other side more ammunition. Ffs. Come back down to earth please. "
'Jfc, he is one of the only R senators voting against the actual bill (not the motion to discuss the bill). How is it so hard for anyone on this sub to understand that?  As far as senators go, he has been one of the most outspoken against Trump. \n\nIf r/politics is going to bitch about McCain then we need to have a full on meltdown on the 48 senators that fall to the right of him on the political spectrum. '
"I must be the only person who got fucked by Obamacare.  I can't afford to have insurance, my premium went from 150 a month to over 500.  I don't know what to do anymore.  \n\n\nI'm currently paying the penalty and just hoping I don't get sick.  This sucks.  :(\n\n"
"I'm sorry I can't take it anymore this is ridiculous, Obamacare has made my family's life exponentially harder with it than without it. Where we live we have very few providers to choose from, because all others found they were taking too many losses and pulled out. Its not just my state either. My little sister has type 1 diabetes which was diagnosed at 2 years. Since my mother works for the local hospital we get discounted healthcare but it is still 5x what we paid before 2010. We have had to make serious adjustments to our lives and not for the better. There are many families like mine that are drowning with no sign of help because of this bullshit, and the left elites feigning care for the lower middle class are using the people that voted for them as shields to keep this shit policy when it only hurts people like my family.     "
"On a factual note, he did not take time out of cancer treatment. \n\nPatients with Glioblastoma have surgery and will rest for 6 weeks before beginning any chemo or radiation therapy. \n\nHe's still an enormous asshole though. "
"Well cool beans /r/politics, the man only put his life on the line and endured horrific torture for your country, but he disagrees with you on the role of government in health care. That undoes all of his prior actions.\n\nSheesh, you're all pathetic and need to grow up."
"Ummm he didn't vote for the bill... He voted in favor of allowing debate on the bill. He's already said he'll vote against the bill in it's current form. But he's also Republican so he probably wants a form of this bill to go.\n\nAlso, WTF is this subs obsession with McCain?"
"Anyone who doesn't support welfare is not a hero? Let's just say forget everyone who has ever voted against welfare/subsidies."
'Literally was just the sole Republican outside of Murkowski and Collins to knock down the "skinny repeal," so all you guys talking shit about McCain can choke on that. '
"Upon reflection, I'm tired of the endless stream of existential threats. "
'Uh, he voted against the shitty Trumpcare and against the Obamacare Repeal... Why the fuck is Reddit going after him?'
'He is more than "no hero" - He is a villain. An evil, repugnant villain. He has used his service as a shield to commit acts of harm to his fellow Americans. What a piece of shit. '
'Poor Americans already have access to healthcare. \n\nMedicare and Medicaid are a thing you fucking fear mongers.'
"First of all, I disagree with McCain on this vote.  But I also remember McCain Feingold.  I remember which GOP senator was the first to call GWB on the use of torture and to openly oppose the invasion of Iraq.  And I remember who served his country his whole life, perhaps most importantly during Vietnam,  where he suffered as a prisoner of war.\n\nJohn McCain isn't my favorite guy all the time, but he meets even the strictest requirements for consideration as a hero."
"Do you honestly think it is so simple as: I hate poor people so I vote yes\n\nIt's insulting for media sources to suggest there aren't legitimate arguments from both sides behind this healthcare debate. \n\nNobody hates people just because they're poor. "
"That is not what he voted for. He voted to start debate. How do you expect them to reach a reasonable compromise if they don't at least talk about it.\n\n1776\xa0(1972)\n\n[Hopkins: Well, in all my years I ain't never heard, seen nor smelled an issue that was so dangerous it couldn't be talked about. Hell yeah! I'm for debating anything. Rhode Island says yea!](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068156/quotes?item=qt0443101)"
'Please correct me if I misunderstood, but I thought the vote was not to repeal ACA, but simply to DEBATE whether or not to repeal it.  Am I wrong about that?'
"It's sad seeing someone who served his country for so long who will die on the wrong side of history."
'Not defending anyone here, just pointing out what is *in the article:*\n\n> John McCain took time out of cancer treatment to vote against poor Americans accessing healthcare â€“ he is no hero\n \nthen \n\n>To be accurate, the vote on Tuesday was only to open debate, and Senator McCain said his vote in no way guaranteed he would vote for the final bill. \n\n\nSo, I guess at least wait for the actual vote before we all get the pitchforks out.'

'Shocking! Trump said something stupid \n\n(there should exist a sarcastic font invented just for Trump posts).'
"Trump is an idiot, this is well established. But we really have to dial back on the uproar every time he makes a minor gaffe. It dilutes the message. Every president has made mistakes like this, and every time there are 50 news stories about Trump doing something stupid it feeds into the message that the news is just hysterical and anti Trump. The news needs to just focus on the big problems, of which there are plenty. We shouldn't lower ourselves to pettiness just because we can. Just because your right doesn't mean you should shove it peoples face constantly."
"I'm an ardent critic of 45 but he mispronounced Namibia, it's not like he made up a country. Stupid crap like this is what lessens valid criticism of Trump's antics and ignorance. "
'Why isn\'t the article Trump mistakenly calls Namibia "Nambia"? I mean I hate the bastard too, but it\'s not like he was talking about a nonexistent country. '
"There is, however, a country called Namibia.  He missed an 'i';  he didn't make up a country.\n\nKeep it up CNN, reach this hard and you'll get people wondering if he's even dumb at all. "
"The title is misleading. They make it sound like he was speaking about a made up country when in fact he basically mispronounced the name of an existing country. \n\nLook, I hate trump just as much as the next guy, but we don't need to be misleading to find things wrong with him. "
"I mean, this article is dumb, the mistake was kind of dumb, but I'd assume he mispronounced Namibia. It's not like he talked about the plight of Novfefe or something. We can hate on way more real shit than this."
"I can't believe this fucking guy is my president. It's been months and I'm still not used to it. I'm sorry, hillary conspiracy theorists, I really am, but there is absolutely no fucking way she would ever have even come close to being this absolutely terrible. Maybe that's why I voted for her, even after voting for bernie in the primaries. Because this is the alternative.\n\nBut no, this is what we have now. Thanks a lot, trump voters. You really made this place great again. Fuck you."
'god. fucking. damn. it.  \nfuck this stupid asshole.'
'Everyone going on about the "he just forgot an i" nonsense. He is the fucking president. He should know. He should understand this shit ahead of time. He is to be held to a higher standard than my girlfriend\'s little sister.'
'As with every daily story about this twat, I say to myself, "what if this was Obama or Clinton?" Can we all imagine the outrage and public flagellation that republicans would have on display?'
"Maybe you should make a simple, secondary school grade quiz for presidential candidates that they have to pass to he able to run to avoid national embarrassments this severe. When a country's leader cannot be taken seriously, it has severe consequences for the nation as a whole, as it pressures its allies' citizens to be uncooperative and/or seek other allies.\n\nSource: am citizen of US allied country and it's a thing."
"Such a petty article. This is what conservatives talk about, liberals crying over little shit like a mispronunciation.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm still shocked every day by this tool's absence of intellect. But I can't help believe that liberals lack focus. There's more devastating shit going on right now that you and I should be reading about."
'this is a minor gaffe and focusing on it makes trumps opposition look petty and small. we should be focusing on the really horrible stuff like intentionally undermining the federal government and selling out to the russians.'

"I wonder how many R's are calling her a RINO right now? The party of no opinions or critical thinking, I hope her and her colleague could restart the party and put it back on the right track, but instead they'll be alienated and isolated. R's don't evolve any more they stick their heads in the sand and kick and scream at anything warning them of the oncoming demographic change."
'She was warned, she was given an explanation, she was even threatened. Nevertheless, she persisted.'
'If her constituents are behind her, then any pressure is meaningless. '
"I'm not adding anything to the conversation but I cannot describe the feeling I had when watching this the other night. They were reading off the names of who voted for what and it sounded so close, but I kept thinking to myself how many people are watching this wondering if they'll survive another year? If this room of people had the power to stop their chemo or no longer fund depression medication.   \n\nKudos to the 3 Republicans, I'm sure it was hard to do."
"It's really sad when we have to celebrate politicians standing up to pressure. Standing up to peer pressure is expected of grade school children. Wtf happened"
"Don't praise the senator praise the protesters like ADAPT for making her do the right thing. "
'I remember her strining the Dems along who wanted a single "yes" vote from a Republican on Obamacare.  As I recall they worked wtih her and then she voted "no."  So, at least now she didn\'t kill it.  That\'ll do.'
'Her state is very rural, not wealthy and pretty aged. She could be thinking of a run for governor.'
'I know it\'s cliche, but this is what\'s wrong with government... She withstood "immense pressure" to vote against something that was total shit, pushed through at midnight, no one had time to read it, and she\'s now some sort of hero. She was just doing her job, but because of the insanity of our electorate and the bullshit way things are pushed through she makes out like she "almost died" doing the right thing or whatever. Stop the world I want to get off. '

"Republicans are fucking evil. That's what you call someone who tries again and again to kick millions off of their* insurance killing tens of thousands each year. Evil. They want to make it impossible for anyone who has a pre-existing condition to get coverage. Evil. That means children born with debilitating diseases won't be covered under their parents' plans. That means that if they somehow make it to adulthood they'll never be able to afford healthcare. Suffer from adolescent depression? No coverage for you. Evil. Adults who were born with conditions or developed them during childhood would no longer be able to afford coverage. They want to make healthcare accessible only for the wealthy and healthy. They're fucking evil. "
'GOP "fuck poor people, fuck sick people, pay your taxes and then die please" '
"Yes, Shareblue is ridiculous. But I'm not seeing this anywhere else on /r/politics. The threat from Graham-Cassidy is very real. McConnell says he is 100% on board and he's pushed back other Senate business like CHIP to get it done by Sep 30.\n\nEveryone needs to call their Senators every day for the next two weeks. Five minutes a day for two weeks. We can stop this."
' This plan would would cause a much higher death count than any terrorist act on American soil,republicans are trading Americans lives for a tax cut for the wealthy. The republicans show what they really value. This one needs to go to the top.'
'I am so tired of all of this. Stop playing with our fucking healthcare. '
'I am very, very liberal, but I\'m getting pretty sick of shareblue.com. We talk a lot about right-wing propaganda, and it is absolutely a massive problem, but this is not far off from left-wing propaganda. I mean, look at this subheading:\n\n> The zombie GOP plan to rob millions of Americans of their health care is back â€” and it\'s worse than ever.\n\nReally? \n\nAnd the whole basis for the assertion that this is a "secret" bill that\'ll pass while "no one\'s paying attention" is based on one former Obama aide tweeting "Theyâ€™re pretty sure people arenâ€™t paying attention." \n\nI think it\'s a bullshit website and it detracts from the legitimate outlets. \n\n**EDIT:** I\'m getting downvoted because people on the left hate to admit that they, too, fall prey to clickbait bullshit articles. As I responded to another comment, [here\'s an article from the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/13/us/politics/health-care-obamacare-single-payer-graham-cassidy.html) explaining that this bill has no chance:\n\n> After Sept. 30, the Graham-Cassidy legislation would lose procedural protections that allow passage in the Senate with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes often required for major legislation.\n\n> **Even with those protections, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said he had seen no evidence that the bill had the votes needed to win approval in the Senate in the next two weeks.** And he noted that it **had not been analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office**, which could take a week or two to estimate how much the bill would cost\n'
' No Trump healthcare plan or GOP healthcare plan. One payer medicare-for-all it saves the government money and gives us all insurance. What is wrong with you folks? Worried about not getting your big tax break?'
" Scheming, conniving, cruel selfish GOP. why don't they care about us? They are elected by us to look out for our welfare. If it was up to them, no one would get welfare. They have lost sight of their true positions and are selling us out.\n"
"America is totaly bizarre. You keep voting this assholes that intentionaly try to ruin your lives. It's not even incompetence, it's pure evil what they are trying to do."
"It just amazes me that the Republicans care doing this when they know the aca is so popular.  People may have been fooled into voting for Trump, but the Republican party will seal its doom when they take healthcare away from people to fund their stupid tax cuts.  How is this not a bigger story and why is it only covered by Shareblue?  Where's WaPo?"
'I have said it before - we have to fight to shut their bullshit down every time, the republicans only have to win once.\n\nIt is only a matter of time until they come up with a plan that is cruel enough for them to fully unite behind.'
'The republican party is going to MURDER thousands of people who will be without insurance due to preexisting conditions.  People are going to DIE because of the republicans.  FUCK this fascist party.  This is extremely outrageous!'
"If electing Donald Trump shone a spotlight on corruption and ineptitude within American politics, wouldn't this also have a similar outcome? \n\nIf the effects of this bill truly are terrible for the American people, won't the passing of this bill have the logical conclusion of further turning public opinion against the GOP?\n\nTragic, outrageous, blatant evil, if anything, seems to be bringing a lot of us together. The more toes that are stepped on by the elite, the more that the rest of us want to fight back.\n\nIs it wrong to want to let this happen? Short-term detriment for long-term change. Ebb and flow of political unrest. "
'This. Is. Evil. The Republicans just want to make sure no poor person will ever have health care ever again. Evil. They are bought and paid for by the rich and wealthy. What are they going to do next? Increase taxes on the poor to pay for the healthcare of the rich? My bet? They will. They will do even more evil. \n\nIf you have a republican friend, stop being friends with them. Its time to force all people who believe in monstrously evil ideas to stop, or else.'
"Lmao really, fucking ShareBlue? From their own fucking website:\n\n>Shareblue Media is an American media company. We produce practical, factual content to **delegitimize Trumpâ€™s presidency**\n\nThis isn't even masquerading as unbiased news, I'm liberal as shit but what the fuck is this propaganda?"
"Republicans don't believe in climate change, so the exceptionally destructive storm will simply be ignored.\n\nRepublicans also don't believe lack of healthcare kills people, either.\n\nBut big tax breaks for their wealthy donors get them re-election funds!  Now that's something they can really believe in and rally behind."
'Oh fuck no, this billl would literally ruin my fucking life'
"Evil, but unsurprising.\n\nThey know they can't really walk into 2018 without having an Obamacare repeal done. Their image as an incompetent clowncar is worse, from a Republican voter standpoint, than an image as evil people who stole healthcare from everyone.\n\nRank and file Republicans will vote for evil over incompetent any day."
'This is disgusting and should be illegal. '
"Listen folks, in the short term this is a terrible move.  Millions will die or end up in poverty.  But that's only better for the Dems in 2018.  Next year, ever Dem running will be marching people up on stage who lost their healthcare or will lose their healthcare.  The commercials alone, showing Grannie dying from diabetes because of Jerry Moran will be brutal.  Terrible, short-sighted move for the Republicans.  It's only going to hasten the move to Single Payer.  Or maybe that's the secret strategy ;-)"
"Yep. And here's that son of a bitch McCain. I was dead wrong about his change of heart it seems. This weasel's final gift to the American people before he shuffles off this mortal coil. "
'Another day, another fake hysteria'
"It's not good enough to take a working plan away, they actually want to fuck us over as well. Bastards, every last one of them.  Of course, they're not going to touch their own sterling healthcare benefits."
'Regardless of what McCain does or how he votes, he is and will always be a dirty rotten scoundrel.'
'Jesus the GOP is fucking evil. Why vote for a party that consistently fucks over the middle class?'
"Fuck I'm scared. I have pre existing conditions. Born with it. No fault of my own and something I can not fix. And they want to treat me like a second class citizen. May they forever rest in hell. "

"> “I will let General Kelly make that decision,” Trump told reporters. “I have no doubt he’ll make the right decision.”\n\nIt really is amazing what a lack of balls Trump actually has.  For all his bluster, he's terrified of anything that resembles direct confrontation.  "
'He should have never had access in the first place. Fuck this criminal administration.'
'From the article: "White House aides are grappling with the fallout of a scandal involving former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, which revealed that dozens of White House aides had yet to receive permanent clearances but nonetheless had access to some of the country’s deepest secrets."\n\nWhat the f**k ?  This is insanely irresponsible. And dangerous. And stupid. and unbelievable. Yet sadly believable from this White House.  \n\nI have only 1 hope for an outcome from all of this. VOTE. People need to realize how important it is now to use your VOTE. You get this nonsense. '

Information is classified Secret when its unauthorized disclosure would cause "serious damage" to national security.[18] Most information that is classified is held at the secret sensitivity.'

Frankly, I\'m sitting here trying to express my astonishment and I can\'t even find the words. I can\'t, I just can\'t. The hypocrisy is frightening.  By any objective measure this administration\'s handling of classified information is *far* more dangerous to the national interest than anything that took place under Obama.  What\'s more, Trump gets to dodge responsibility for this by saying it\'s in Kelly\'s hands?  *Really*?'
"he's probably stolen enough info to get himself outta debt anyway. these fuckers are all arch criminals."

"As a never Trumper who also thought Clinton's emails was a valid scandal, the big question here is do these emails contain classified info? Using private emails to conduct business was never the Clinton scandal alone, rather it was the mishandling of classified info. If Kushner emailed classified info via a private email, *then* this story gets interesting."
"It's only bad when Democrats do it. Oh wait. Wasn't Kushner a Democrat until, like, 18 months ago? It's only bad when Hillary Clinton does it. Apparently."
"Why are the president's daughter and son-in-law conducting White House business at all? Why the fuck do we even have a [nepotism law,](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/3110) if it doesn't prevent this banana republic bullshit? The law specifically applies to presidents and explicitly applies to the relation of son-in-law. "

She was never charged with anything but you would think after all the Hillary shit that still goes on some laws would have been changed to make this similar behavoir illegal.  The Republicans thought this was jail worthy, right?  And where is the server located that Kushner and Ivanka are using for their second email accounts?

'I’m really sick of seeing this stuff and nothing happening. If this is the case, use our tax money and get him! If we can’t do anything about it other than keep me in a constant state of being pissed off that elites get away with everything, I’d just rather not know.'
"My opinion as someone who has experience with the SF-86 security clearance form is that Kushner has already committed perjury and could be prosecuted by these omissions. He has shown a pattern of omitting relevant foreign contacts despite the numerous warnings on the form that lying or willingly omitting information is considered perjury. The problem is my opinion doesn't matter; Rod Rosenstein's is the only opinion that matters."
"and to think, years ago when I applied for a 'secret' level clearance I decided to be honest and was scared they might deny me because I admitted that I had been arrested for pot once 5 years prior even though it had been expunged from my record.  Then again we had a real presidential administration back then, not this fucking clownshow.  If I was in that same position today seeing the example this administration sets I probably would have just lied and pretended I never got arrested.  Back then I still believed things mattered."
"Kushner failed to disclose something else?! My god!\n\nFrankly I'd be more surprised by a news day that didn't include something Kushner failed to disclose"

'When the hell is this circus of a presidency going to end?'
'As anyone who has ever held a TS/SCI clearance can attest, the forms you fill out for your background investigation are pretty serious.  And the guy explaining the form to you usually lets you know how fucking serious they are about you filling it out as completely as possible and as accurate as possible.  There is no way in hell he should have received a clearance, much less still possess one now.  Anyone else would have had it yanked after the first disclosure.  '
"Buuuuuut he's just a young 30-somthing kid...we can't expect him to remember his treasonous contacts with Russians. I mean his brain isn't even well developed yet...\n\n"

Given his shady dealings with foreign powers, it wouldn't surprise me to learn he used what he saw to help get loans for his failing companies, but him being a part of the White House may give him legal cover if he did.\n\nIs there any way to prevent him from abusing the things he should never have seen in the first place?"

"it all makes sense now. jared kushner is a trans woman and trump found out which caused him to tweet the transgender ban in a rage at discovering his daughter was married to a trans woman.\n\nkappa.\n\nedit: the trans man theory may have legs because new jersey (kushner's state of birth) doesnt allow birth certificate gender marker changes without having undergone SRS\n\nwhich means its completely possible he changed his legal name but couldnt change his legal birth certificate gender marker, explaining why he had to put female. or he's just more incompetent then anyone knew (still kappa)"
'HAHAH at least this gives some credence to his arguments that he didnt knowingly incorrectly omit major meetings. He is and has always just been incompetent! '
'Wtf I hate trans people now'
'**BIG FUCKING DEAL** ( /s ) - really - this is a non-fucking issue.  For 32 years I, a male, was in the social security system as female.  Yet I able to (forcefully)register for the draft, get married, register to vote... I only found out when filing the paperwork after my first wife died in 2011.  You know what the woman working at the office did?  She just changed it.  Either someone at the hospital filled out the paperwork wrong, or a DB migration issue caused a bunch of M/F bits to move to the left one position.  (I work in software and tend to blame everything on specs, test cases, and project managers...) \n\nWhat does it mean?  Fuck all. :P'
"This isn't politics.  This is just pathetic.  For all we know, whoever entered the form into a computer put the wrong gender.  There are a lot of actual, serious things to criticize Kushner about.  This just makes those of us who oppose Trump look absolutely petty."

'"Jared Kushner failed to disclose" would make a damn fine Cards Against Humanity prompt'
'Jared Kushner failed to disclose that he is a morally bankrupt individual'
'How. The. Fuck. Is. He. Even. Still. In. The. White. House. \n\nEdit: My theory on why he hasn’t been indicted yet is because Mueller is leaving him there for the Carmelo Anthony effect. Kid just fucks up over and over and over and causes more problems. '
'It\'s actually annoying me now to read "failed to disclose".\n\nHe didn\'t fail, he just chose not to.'
'The failure to disclose _again_ just seems like another “add it to that security breach pile over there” but that he failed to disclose that he is _an active participant_ in the Israel-Palestine conflict when tasked with negotiating a settlement between the Israelis and Palestinians is _crazy making._\n\nIt’s bad enough to appoint an American Jew to this task - we are not exactly neutral parties with regard to Israel - but to put an American Jew _who is funding settlements_ in charge is just like all of Trumps’ US cabinet appointments, active sabotage of their functions. It’s breathtaking and we have lost what little influence we had with the Palestinians. The US may never be able to regain any credibility as any kind of disinterested party. '
'Imagine what he\'ll be shown to have failed to disclose a few months down the line.\n\nI can see the headlines now:\n\n>"Jared Kushner failed to disclose that he is a Martian from the underground city of Zorg."'
'This fucker is into a lot of shady shit. '
'Jared Kushner failed to disclose he is a reptilian shapeshifter trying to enslave humanity. '
"Isn't there a point where he just has to go to jail without passing go? I mean seriously, any of us would have suffered consequences from this level of contempt for the law far before this point."
"Instead of 'failed to disclose' they should start reporting it as 'failed to conceal'."
'Ok stop me if I sound a bit /r/ conspiracy... \n\nFlynn asked diplomat Kislyak to veto the Egyptian UN resolution on Israeli Illegal developments. \n\nKushner failed to disclose backing a company that builds said type pf developments.\n\nHuh\n'
'Jared failed to disclose something?\n\nNo! Impossible! Unpresidented! \n\nThere must be some mix up. '
'They’re not “illegal”- they’re against “international law”, which many countries including the US “breaks” all the time. \n\nAccording the international law, waging any war at all without the approval of the U.N. Security Council is illegal. America has done it about 20 times over the past 20 years. President Clinton broke international law to attack Iraq and Yugoslavia. President Obama broke international law by attacking in Syria. Bush and Obama both broke international law with their multitude of drone assassinations. Bush lead violations of international law with regards to the “illegal” detentions and torture of terrorists he captured. Some munitions that the US uses like white phosphorous incendiary munitions and cluster bombs are “illegal” under international law. \n\nSo give me a break the Israeli settlements were only made to be against international law because in the Oil Age the Arab countries wielded too much diplomatic power. Now, with the end of the oil age, we no longer have to appease these terrible Arab countries and can make decisions based on morality, such as a decision to defend the one state in the Middle East where non-Muslims can live in peace and prosperity vs the 22 Arab countries in the Middle East where nobody besides Muslim Arabs have full and equal rights. '
'Technically not illegal, but very immoral. I generally want the best for israel(and the Palestinians on s separate note) but this is just the dumbest most unnecessary thing they do. If they completely stopped the new settlements, their international reputation would be way better. But the right wing Israelis don’t want defined borders so they can continue on their holy war that most of the country could not care less about.'
'“Jared Kushner failed to disclose _______” is like the new Trump administration Mad Libs. '
'The entire Trump family seems to be extremely forgetful. Worryingly, considering that Kushner is now also afflicted, this appears to be contagious rather than genetic. I expect numerous "I do not recall" statements in the nearby future.'

'Fuck that. \n\nMueller, fuck these guys up already. '
"Remember when Obama was told by the ethics council that appointing even *distant* family members to *distant* government positions would be horrendously unethical if not legally actionable?  \n  \nThen Trump puts his daughter and son-in-law down the hall from him in high-level White House positions and apparently that's fine.  \n  \nAnyone with two brain cells to rub together that I see defending Trump is defending the corruption and dismantlement of western democracy."

'Is the media really this stupid or just this spineless?\n\nWhy has right wing politics consisted of lying to their voters and disenfranchising everyone else from voting?  Why are right wing voters consistently the most ill-informed demographics every year for decades?\n\nThe only reason anyone anywhere sees the Republican Party as a legitimate political party in a democracy is because the media goes out of their way to portray them as such.  Portraying blatant intentional lies as honest ideological differences is exactly what disingenuous lying people depend on.  Don\'t even acknowledge their opinion as a legitimate opinion of it isn\'t fact based.  Simply take out the falsehoods, highlight them and simply ask the viewer why they would be lying?  \n\nYou don\'t even show your audience their full narrative.  You\'ve seen it and you know it has false information.  It is impossible to reach a valid conclusion based on logic using false assumptions.  Therefore an opinion based on a falsehood is objectively invalid and therefore useless and wrong.  No need to waste anyone\'s time repeating it.  \n\nThe news is that someone could have such an objectively wrong opinion.  If the president says "I think 1+1=banana", you don\'t need to repeat that to report to your audience that the president is mathematically illiterate.  And you certainly don\'t need to repeat it as if it\'s actually up for debate.  Not everyone with an opinion is an expert, or even right, or even not objectively wrong.  The right depends on the left forgetting that, or as is often the case, ignoring it in misguided attempts at equality.\n\nThe dishonest do not deserve the benefit of the doubt like decent people.  If you choose to operate outside the rules and norms of decent society, you have absolutely no reason to expect the benefits of decent society. You don\'t treat the serially dishonest as if they are acting in good faith, you ignore and ostracize them.  There are enough decent people who need help and warrant attention to waste time on those who choose to be garbage.\n\n'

"I miss the rule of law. America is a one-party state and is no different from Russia, China, Cuba, or North Korea. \n\nIt's fucking sad watching this country devolve into an autocracy.\n\n"
"Why hasn't his clearance been pulled yet? People get their secret clearance pulled for missing one contact. Even lying once about it. This guy gets to continually lie about foreign contacts and continues to get extra chances and access to classified materials? "
"In 2010 I was the company executive officer for a unit deploying to Iraq.  Our mission was to provide security to the US Embassy personal in Baghdad.  Most people in the company needed a security clearance for this mission.  I had to beg, write letters for exceptions, and talk to interviewers for several  Soldiers who couldn't get a clearance.\n\nThe biggest reason for denial was credit score.  Young, dumb, college students from Kentucky didn't pay bills or we're in credit card debt. \n\nOne was denied because he told the investigator he could drink a 12 pack of beer followed by bourbon all night (again a dumbass bragging about how much he could drink)\n\nOne was denied because she got an Article 15 in basic training for fighting another girl.\n\nFuck Jared Kushner and a system that allows him to work on an interim clearance."
"It is hard to pick which piece of this administration angers me most, but this is in the top 2. Kushner's real estate business is nothing more than a money laundering scheme for foreign criminals, yet he is allowed to work in the west wing without a permanent security clearance. This is 100 times worse than anything they can claim about crooked Hilary."
"I'm so fucking sick of seeing all these damning stories come out and ZERO CONSEQUENCES."

'Such bullshit. A buddy of mine applied to work at the FBI as a locksmith and failed his polygraph test (for no reason; he was 100% honest) and couldn’t get the job. He needed the polygraph to get his clearance.\n\nMeanwhile, this fuckstain is somehow still the right hand stooge of the President*'
"I don't understand how any of this works. If you can just lie on your forms and then change them when you get caught, or lie to congress (like Jeff Sessions) and then change your answers when you get caught, etc., with no penalty, what is the point of the rules and process to begin with?"
'god damned i really hate these autoplay videos containing only the text which is below and overdramatically music. like wtf. why? '
'So he\'s as dirty as his father-in-law - figures.  That\'s the only way Trump would have accepted him for his daughter.  Meanwhile conservatives are bleating "Well Demmercrats wud have raised taxes MOAR!" in yet another deflection.  That\'s part of the strategy I think, get so much crap all going at the same time that you cannot focus on all the problems with the (R)ussians and Trump because there\'s just too much to tackle.  I wonder if that\'s what is holding Mueller up, there\'s just so much to wade through.'
"His security officer needs to be fired if he is going to allow Kushner to ruin the integrity of the clearance process. It's bullshit.

"He's either epically incompetent and shouldn't have a security clearance or he intentionally omitted disclosures and shouldn't have a security clearance.  I'm going with the latter. Lock him up.  /r/KushnerForPrison. \n\n Either way, he needs to go. \n\n"
"So......this is a fire able offense is it not? If I lied on and fucked up paperwork to that degree in any job I've had in the past I would be rightly let go for incompetent behavior. But over in bizaro world on the other had, Jared has a silver spoon jammed so far up his ass he will probably get a couple more job titles added to his ridiculous list of responsibilities. "
"As someone who intimately knows others with security clearances, the most surprising part of the process **isn't if you're admitting to wrong doing, but rather failing to disclose it**. \n\nThe biggest liability with a clearance is blackmail. So if you tell government you once did an 8 ball of blow with a hooker, they're far less likely to care because they know and it can't be used as leverage. So if someone comes to that person about the hooker, he /she can be like cool, my bosses already know kthxbye. At a certain level of clearance, the reality is very few people can do the job necessary, so yes telling the government about illegal shit won't affect you as much as you might think. \n\nThe best example of this I can think of was a guy who had to come in with his wife and tell his boss in front of her that he was having an affair. She already knew it, but it had to be pubically disclosed so the classified shit he was handling couldn't be coehersed from him. \n\nSo the irony is, Kushner *potentially* could've disclosed all his shit and would've been fine. It's because he *lied* on a government document, a felony mind you,  which is why people want his head. As they damn well should. "
"He's a criminal from a criminal family who\nMarried into a criminal family. "
"There are zero mistakes on Kushner's forms.  Mistakes are unintentional."
'You mean the guy that when his father broke the law and went to prison he went with revenge? Paint me shocked.'
"Anyone not the president's son-in-law would have had his clearance revoked and his ass kicked to the curb at the very least. Jared should be watching the world from inside a prison cell. This is affluenza at its highest echelon, and it makes me sick."
'From now on, perjury level omissions and mistakes shall be called... "Jareds."'
"I'm sorry, but I'm over being outraged at Kushner on this - if the 'Chief' background checks guy complains that its beyond the pale - but no one will take a stand and attempt to revoke his clearance. He merely complains.  All these muther-effers do is complain while allowing extraordinary, unheard-of behavior to continue.\n\nIf you don't take a stand, you're complicit. End of story."
"So like everybody else associated with Trump, he is a lying piece of shit. Is anybody surprised? Anybody who doesn't meet Trump and immediately diagnose him as human shaped garbage is a shit person themselves. It's that simple."
'I had to tell some TS clearance person that I smoked weed with my buddy in college. Jared Fucking Kushner can eat a dick. Why does this guy still have a job?! How does he still have clearance?!'

Raising a stink that everything was "illegal" when it wasn\'t has given everyone "Boy who cried wolf" syndrome, so when Trump\'s sycophants sweep it under the rug, everyone thinks nothing of it. '
"Wow, it's almost as though the current administration were corrupt or incompetent or both.  Surely the embarrassment from this scandal will force some drastic reforms to how they do business in the White House."
"I've heard a bunch of people talk about this over the months. One conversation in particular stands out. It was former FBI and former CIA agents and someone who had a loved one obtain top secret security. They talked about how terrifying the SF86 form is and how someone knows someone who was fired immediately for failing to disclose a single time in school where they smoked pot. Kushner apparently filled out his SF86 the same week he met russians and didn't disclose. They were saying bc of the nature of the form, it's not possible he simply forgot. So the question becomes, why did he try to conceal it? Now apparently it was a bunch of stuff he tried to conceal. It explicitly states there are criminal penalties for lying on the form "
"Man, if I'd fucked up my background check paperwork that badly I'd never have gotten a security clearance (had one for 11 years, I'm out now).\n\nKushy gets in because nepotism.\n\nFuck this administration."
'I think he\'s trying to be diplomatic. In reality he\'s thinking "This guy is either a complete fuck up or the worlds worst conman."'
"That picture of Kushner is going to be one that's in the history books, he looks... Evil. It's actually a little scary. When this all shakes out this will be be picture people remember of him."
"A few questions:\n\nIf this is the case, why was he given the level of security clearance he has? Is the background check chief/responsible personnel incompetent? Do the background check people even matter? What other stuff has leaked through this gap of a check? Spies, saboteurs, plain ol' crazy people? Where else do oopsies of this magnitude occur without notice?"
'> ... mistakes and omissions ...\n\nI believe the technical term is ***lies***. Jared Kushner is a lawyer. Completing legal forms is not a foreign or irregular concept to him. He intentionally lied on his forms, being careful to omit anything that would draw unwanted attention to his personal or professional activities. This was *not* a series of unfortunate mistakes.'

But, listen, we don\'t know if Obama used this for paying terrorists, we don\'t know if he funded Russia hacking, which there is no collusion, like all the Democrats even say, definitely no collusion, but he probably was working with Hillary to have collusion with Russia. It\'s just not safe, and I know safe, I\'m so safe my friends say \'be less safe\' but we can\'t have someone unsafe like Obama in here with clearance to sensitive information. Get him out! OUT!"'
'And here I am struggling with not being "qualified" for jobs around dc cause it\'s hard as hell to get a security clearance. '
"So my question is, assuming we had a functioning Congress that didn't abdicate their checks and balances responsibilities, what should/could be done?  Trump says he wants him as an adviser, he flunks his clearance, then what happens?  He's barred from the WH?  Security wouldn't let him into meetings?  What would stop Trump from calling him up and just talking to him about what ever the fuck he wants?\n\nMore generally, this sort of applies to ALL of Trump's cabinet - even if Congress rejected them in the confirmation hearing, couldn't he just hire that person as staff, and then give him/her the de facto cabinet responsibilities?  Trump's WH doesn't really have a hierarchy beyond Trump, then Jarvanka, and then everyone else, so it would seem that there's no real way Congress could provide oversight.\n\nSide note: I hate that Trump makes us ponder these sort of things, just because he's the type of asshole who doesn't care about rules, norms, traditions or the appearance of impropriety."

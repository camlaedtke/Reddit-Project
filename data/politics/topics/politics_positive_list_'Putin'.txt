Trump White House edits Putin support for Trump out of transcript and video
‘Treason’ Is Top Searched Word After Trump-Putin Press Conference
Megathread: House Intelligence Committee Ends Investigation, Finds No Collusion With Russia
Trump chooses Putin's word over the US intelligence community — again
"The Republicans didn't join in because they were focused on the task at hand—eliminating funding for election security.\n\nReally.\n\n>It came as the House moved forward with a spending bill that eliminates new funding for election security grants to states, amid protests by Democrats who say Republicans are not doing enough to prevent Russian meddling in U.S. elections."
"Let's see how the Russian trolls, Sean Hannity and Alex Jones spins this against the democrats.\n\nEdit: lol, RIP inbox! Keep it up I'm having fun!\n\nEdit 2: Whoever gave me gold my hats off to you.... MY SHIT POSTING HAS PAID OFF BOYS! (that's what my wife said).\n\nEdit 3: Just read the comments section on the article and Jesus Christ is there a ton of Goalpost moving and spin I don't even think those guys even need to put a spin on it their base has already done their job for them. Amazing. "
">They began chanting “USA, USA, USA”-- but it wasn't a Trump rally.\n\nThe USA doesn't belong to Nazis and Magaots. It's well past time to reclaim it. "
"That's my representative!    \n    \nEdit: If you share my district, consider sending [Steny](https://hoyer.house.gov/contact-info/) an 'attaboy'."
'Donald Trump and the Nationalist Republican Party are the true enemies of the people and America as a whole.\n\n'
'And the Republicans quietly murmured, "Sweet Russian cash!"'
"Fucking Republicans just sitting on their hands.\n\n>Somebody said 'treasonous.' I mean, yeah, I guess. Why not?. Can we call that treason? Why not. They certainly didn’t seem to love our country very much."
'Democrats are now the party of National Security.'
">Democrats then began chanting. Republicans didn’t join in.\n\nWhere's the patriotism when it's needed?  I still can't believe all these repubs will defend traitor trump."
'Whenever I’m complaining on reddit about the Dems not doing anything, this is the “something” I’m looking for. I just want them to act as crazy as this situation is. Make a scene. Quit acting like it’s business as usual. I’m glad to see this '
'This might be a real way forward for the dems.  If they can reinvent themselves as the party of patriotism they can strike a chord with swing voters.'
'> Democrats then began chanting. Republicans didn’t join in.\n\nRemember, when Dems didn\'t cheer for Trump\'s SOTU lies about employment, it was "treasonous."  So I guess we can expect him to say the same about Senate Republicans now, right?'
"This is a pretty neutral coverage by Fox... and the comments are all anti-Trump. Wonder what's going on."
'Looks like the next few weeks are gonna be wild. Buckle up'
'Is it still nationalism if the thing about America that I love the most is our liberal immigration & melting pot history & policies?\n\nEdit: Noah Smith said on twitter that liberal nationalism was the way out of this mess. He said it was the way out in 1860-1865 and 1929-1945.'
"Watching this was the most proud I've felt to be an American in a loooong time."
'~~For the People~~\n\nDefend and Protect'
'Any Republican still supporting Trump is a traitor to America. '
'Anyone else watch that and feel proud to be an American for the first time in a while?'
'Honestly, this should be the approach Dems take. Out patriot the party '
'Democrats: the true patriots'
'"Democrats then began chanting. Republicans didn’t join in."'
'A Fox news article reached the top! A Fox news article reached the top!\n\nWow. '
"I've said it before and I'll say it again.\n\nFuck these traitorous Republican cowards. Hope Mueller has a wide enough net to drag in all this trash floating around. "
'As an Irishman, watching events in the USA, I have to say, I thought you guys were finished. Glad to see I was wrong.'
'Democrats are showing signs of life. I hope this sets a trend.\n\n'
'im not gonna lie i teared up a bit hearing the chants on such an important issue. \n\nthough trump has been a nightmare, he has absolutely brought much more attention to politics in general. That attention is going to cause change in the future, and i cant wait.'
'The implication here is pretty major. Mueller is establishing that Guccifer was a GRU front. In other words, those who were communicating with Guccifer in the GOP orbit regarding the release of information damaging to the DNC and HRC were actually communicating with Russian intelligence services.'
"This is important because they are Russian Intelligence Officials which directly contradicts Trump's claim that 'Putin didn't do it'..."
'Republicans: “The Mueller probe hasn’t found anything!”\n\nMueller: “Here’s a dickload of indictments.”\n\nRepublicans: “THE MUELLER PROBE HASN’T FOUND ANYTHING!”\n\nMueller: “Kinda sounds like you guys want more indictments...”'
'And the GOP is doing nothing to stop them from hacking into the 2018 election. '
'One of the people mentioned in [point 44. of the indictment](https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download) is absolutely Roger Stone. If you look [here](https://www.factcheck.org/2017/06/timeline-russia-investigation/), you can see where from Aug. 14-17, Roger Stone communicated with Guccifer 2.0. This is some pretty huge news. \n\nEdit: This seems like an outline for where the investigation is going since the indictment specifically mentions a U.S. Congress candidate requesting access to the hacked information from Guccifer 2.0. AND the indictment also states that Guccifer communicated with U.S. Persons, not just a person, about the release of the stolen documents. '
'["Russia, if you\'re listening, I hope you\'re able to find the 30,000 (Clinton) emails that are missing."](https://youtu.be/3kxG8uJUsWU?t=41s) \\-Trump, 7-27-16'
'From the indictment\n\n> on or about July 27, 2016, the Conspirators attempted after hours to spearphish for the first time email accounts at a domain hosted by a third-party provider and used by Clinton\'s personal office. At or around the same time, they also  targeted seventy-six email addresses at the domain for the Clinton Campaign.  \n\nSo the Russians first started going after Clinton\'s emails on July 27, 2016.  Hmm, why does that date sound so familiar...... Oh yah!  \n  \n[Donald Trump Calls on Russia to Find Hillary Clinton’s Missing Emails\nVideo\n](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html)  \n"Russia, if you\'re listening, I hope you\'re able to find the 30 thousand emails" - Donald Trump July 27, 2016\n\n'
'The 12 people indicted are: \n\n1. Viktor Borisovich Netyksho\n2. Boris Alekseyevich Antonov\n3. Dmitriy Sergeyevich Badin\n4. Ivan Sergeyevich Yermakov\n5. Aleksey Viktorovich Lukashev\n6. Sergey Aleksandrovich Morgachev\n7. Nikolay Yuryevich Kozachek\n8. Pavel Vyacheslavovich Yershov\n9. Artem Andreyevich Malyshev\n10. Aleksandr Vladimirovich Osadchuk\n11. Aleksey Aleksandrovich Potemkin\n12. Anatoliy Sergeyevich Kovalev.\n\n\nSounds to me like this is quite the "vich hunt".'
'Not sure if anyone has reported on this yet, but there was a hidden bombshell in the indictment released today that is VERY interesting.\n\nThe Russians first started trying to hack Clinton\'s personal email server on July 27th. What else happened earlier that exact day?\n\nThat was the day Trump famously publicly called on the Russians to hack into Hillary\'s emails and find what he called the 33,000 missing emails.\n\nI thought that July 27th date seemed familiar, so I had to go back and check on it and sure enough. You heard it here first.\n\nI have a feeling this was a pretty clear signal being sent to Agent Orange by Mueller\'s team that Trump and his folks are likely the "un-indicted co-conspirators" mentioned in the indictment. Time will tell.\n\n*"For example, on or about July 27, 2016, the Conspirators*  \n*attempted after hours to spearphish for the first time email accounts at a domain hosted by a thirdparty*  \n*provider and used by Clinton’s personal office. At or around the same time, they also*  \n*targeted seventy-six email addresses at the domain for the Clinton Campaign."*'
'[. @KenDilanianNBC notes indictment alleges Russia **"on or about July 27, 2016"** started trying to access Clinton\'s personal emails.

'The United States government just charged 12 foreign military officials with hacking and interfering with our electoral process. Indicting a military member is the same thing as saying the foreign government did it. The President who benefited directly from all of this is meeting with the president of the foreign government on Monday, and has his 2nd SCOTUS nominee in the works. \n\nWe should be fucking rioting.'
'This is how Fox News is reporting the story.\n\n* [Sore Subject](https://imgur.com/a/Sbhczsw)\n\n* [Using words as "allegedly" to downplay the significance, importance, and seriousness of these charges.](https://imgur.com/a/tEObEG7)\n\n* [Quoting out of context quotes, to ensure those reading that "it doesn\'t matter" because votes were not changed.](https://imgur.com/a/mMayk7q)\n\nFox News is beyond being fake news, it is pure brain washing right wing propaganda. '
'In light of these indictments, which he knew of ahead of time, please consider tweeting, messaging, phoning every senator and congress and public person you can think of and publicly demanding the summit with Putin is called off.  \n\n1) It’s what any American would do, regardless of party. \n\n2) It is entrapment to force Trump to show who he sides with, us or Putin. \n\n3) He is on the world stage.  EVERYONE is watching.  \n\nMake him choose.'

'Hi whoever is reading this comment.\n\n\n\nHope you have a nice day! :)'
'Is this what we do now? Hand over US nationals to a hostile foreign power for interrogation? '
"If you really care about this matter, call your House of Congress Representative. Tell them you think the president's actions are treasonous. For him to believe Russia over our own intelligence officers is ridiculous, because he is supposed to be the highest intelligence officer. \n\nTheir contact information can be found at: \n\nhttps://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative\n\nIn order for a president to be impeached, any member of the House of Representatives can introduce articles of impeachment. These charges then have to be approved by a majority of the House Judiciary Committee, establishing there is in fact enough reason to impeach. Then, the House votes on the issue. If a simple majority votes yes, the president is impeached.\n\nEdit: Ignore. Nothing was changed. I didn't not mean to type anything wrong. The comments below reflect that."
"> “Amb. McFaul served our country honorably and with full diplomatic immunity,” Rice tweeted. “If the White House cannot defend and protect our diplomats, like our service members, they are serving a hostile foreign power not the American people.”    \n\nThe WH and our part-time president are Putin's lapdogs, and if we let trump get away with even proposing an abomination like this, so are we.  Call your reps now to protest this outrage."
"I love how all the ex diplomats have shit to say and all of the current ones are quiet.\n\nEveryone in the US is a slave to the money. Won't leave your job to protest because job and come up with scape goats like I have kids and bills and shit.\n\nCan't be a patriot and have excuses."
'Hes scared shitless of Putin. Its simple. Compromised or not, collusion or not, hes scared shitless. He will do anything Putin says. He wont say anything bad about Putin until he is back home or tweeting. Even then its borderline. \n\nAnd people say Obama was a pussy. Trump is tough behind his tweets, just like his supporters are “tough” behind the screen.\n\nFucking pussies all of them'
"Trump:\n\nA. Has such a fragile ego he will sacrifice the nation to protect his megalomania of winning the election himself.\n\nB. He is compromised.\n\nC. He is grossly incompetent.\n\nPick. I guess it's multiple choice. All roads should lead to impeachment *or 25th amendment.\n\nBut I guess some think this is an option....\n\nD. A brilliant mastermind using 4D chess to destroy the evil Democrat pedo/cannibal cabal with Putin and Muller to save the white Christian race.\n\n*Edit"
'1987:  Mr. Gorbachev tear down that wall.\n\n2018:  Mr. Putin please pull down your zipper.'
"It boggles my mind that the US Senate still trust your president after all this obvious signs that he is somehow compromised by a foreign power. Aren't you guys afraid of the fact that you have a puppet sitting in your seat of power?"
"Trump won't let himself by questioned by Mueller, but is happy to let other officials get interrogated by Russia.  "
'Americans sure love to brag about how brave and strong and free they are and how much they love the Constitution, but when push comes to shove you’re all milquetoast pussies who are more worried about your dead end jobs than rescuing yourselves from a fascist takeover. Good luck regaining even a shred of dignity on the world stage in the next ten generations. \n\nEdit: They’re so angry, lol. Big angry hard-arses when it comes to shitposting on reddit, tiny impotent mewlings when it comes to standing up for themselves in real life. No wonder Trump won so easily. '
'You might as well put a Russian flag on White House '

'Trump: Thank you sir may I please have another sir? '
"Trump supporters: Wait...there's a difference???"
'I wonder how many people upvoted this thinking he was talking about Trump.\n\n>Instead he said Mr Trump was "not my bride, and I\'m not his groom." \n\nI like how he made Trump the woman in this scenerio. '
'Why is everyone in the comments talking about Trump?\n\n>Mr Putin was referring to a 2007 gaffe by former US President George W Bush, when he thanked then-Australian leader John Howard for visiting Austrian troops in Iraq.'
'It\'s funny that the narrative switches between "Trump is a Russian puppet" and "Trump is such a bad leader even those spooky Russians can agree" fairly regularly.\n\n\nIf you want to push an idea, you should make sure you know what it is that you\'re trying to push first. Otherwise it becomes pretty obvious that you\'re basically just throwing crap at the walls and seeing what sticks, which really makes people disinclined to listen to you in the future should you *actually* have reason to complain.\n\n\nSeriously, it\'s *been* happening basically since the primaries. And not only with Trump, but with right-wing politics in general. As an example check out Charlottesville:\n\n "The Left" was screaming about Nazis about a year too early. They started calling people that *clearly* weren\'t Nazis, Nazis. It started as hyperbole but Poe\'s Law dictated that would soon change. Soon many more joined in, and legitimately believed it. After a while, the narrative became that Nazis were everywhere. Love and behold, when Nazis were told there were Nazis everywhere they felt empowered to come out of hiding. Surely they would find support since everyone was a Nazi just like them. And the fucked up thing is they were kind of right. Because *everyone* was a Nazi, *no one* was a Nazi. I still don\'t know if the majority of the US realizes there *actually were* **real** Nazis there. "The Left" weakened their message too much. Like the boy who cried wolf, on a national scale.'
"And we'll never hear Trump criticize Putin for saying this"
"Wait, so we're not outraged about Russia today? This sub is so confusing."
"He ain't lying! \n\nWe know that at least 30% of the population is ill-informed enough to make voting decisions based on cheap MAGA sloganeering, and chants about Guns, Jesus and Abortions. Meanwhile, their elected officials do the bidding of lobbyists and sell their constituents down the river.  "
"Yeah they just don't take orders very well do they"
'Whats a good way to say "you\'re not wrong but also fuck you?"  \n\nIt\'s pretty obvious that shit like this is explicitly to undermine people\'s confidence in democratic systems of government.  It\'s probably not even meant for us to hear, it\'s for Russia to hear to try to sandbag any people who think the grass is greener.'

'so he felt the need to LIE to the American people beforehand, telling us [he had no intention of calling Putin to congratulate him](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/white-house-no-plan-to-congratulate-vladimir-putin-on-his-election-victory). yet goes ahead and does it in secret, after which we the American people, have to hear it from the Kremlin, that our President called Putin behind our backs.\n\nTrump is a compromised Russian asset and a traitor.'

'I wish people would quit using the word “emboldened.”  Donald Trump is completely and totally unhinged. '
'"You can\'t go after a fine woman like Ivanka!" As soon as Rudy said that on Hannity I knew she was fucked.'
">Ivanka Trump, who now works in her father’s administration, did not respond to questions sent to her personal email, chief of staff, and the White House. A spokesperson for her attorney wrote that Ivanka Trump did not know about the Trump Moscow project “until after a nonbinding letter of intent had been signed, never talked to anyone outside the Organization about the proposal, and, even internally, was only minimally involved. Her only role was limited to reminding Mr. Cohen that, should an actual deal come to fruition (which it did not) the project, like any other with the Trump name, conform with the highest design and architectural standards.”\n\n>**But emails and interviews suggest that her involvement ran deeper.**\n\nTheir first reaction to this news becoming public, was to lie to journalists about it.\n\nThat's not the sign of an innocent person."
'Oh look, another Trump who is going to go the jail (or pardoned by her constitution-destroying father).'
'> Klokov initially told BuzzFeed News that he did not “send any emails” to Cohen. “I don’t understand why you ask me about this,” Klokov said in text messages. “I’m weightlifter, not a political.” When told that he had sent at least two emails to Cohen and had had a phone conversation with him at Ivanka Trump’s request, Klokov stopped responding.\n\nMaybe he was being honest and Buzzfeed is just misquoting him. Maybe he was admitting that he\'s "not apolitical".'
'Well THIS is certainly going to cause a tweetstorm from Trump. '
'LoOk, this is a typical liberal distraction from the left leaning democratic liberals because they’re worried about our focus on Hillary emailing Ben Ghazi on a private server asking DACA immigrants to bring suitcases of tan suits and Dijon mustard across the border to try and make sure Christianity ends in support of kneeling MS-13 NFL players. The president has been very clear about this. '
'There is nothing that would make a Rosenstein/Mueller firing happen faster than it he learns they are able to tie Ivanka to all of this. Things might be heating up pretty soon.'

'About fucking time. We all knew she was wrapped up in this. Its nice to finally see some proof. '
"Wow, and only a few days after the special master revealed that most of Cohen's communications aren't protected under attorney-client privilege. I'm guessing it's about to get REAL for a lot of people who've been mighty quiet for the past few months. "
'Amazing how far we\'ve come from "no contact with the Russians whatsoever"'
"Well that can't be right, because Trump said nobody in his orbit knows any Russians whatsoever. These people sure know a lot of Russians for people who don't know any Russians."

"Can't wait till Mueller gathers all this....I can't wait till it's all wrapped in a nice little bow."
"I'm sure it's just a coincidence that it's always Russia and not any other country."
"The Trump's had a lot of contact with the Russians because a key source of financing for their projects came from Russian banks that would give them credit when others wouldn't touch them with a ten foot pole because of the credit risk they represented.  And Putin and the Russians always have put a premium on supporting candidates and movements in the far right and far left that could prove disruptive to competitor nations political systems.  Disruption equals weakness and that is how it has played out here in the US."
"Oh god. We should be very careful going after Trump's girlfriend."
'This story should be blowing up everywhere.  The Government should not edit what people should see on their televisions like that, this is not Soviet Russia.'
"Do they honestly think that them doing this erases it from everyone's memory and/or every media's copy?  Seriously?"

"Here's the link to the White House video with the edited question. [Video should start at 2:18:20](https://youtu.be/iNIPo_pZ7AI?t=2h18m20s). As crazy as Maddow makes it sound, it's actually even crazier. It doesn't just cut off part of the reporter's question, it changes the entire point of it. The reporter's question was about if Putin wanted Trump and instructed officials to help him win. The edited version makes it sound like the reporter's question was continuing on what Putin was talking about, which was about interrogating Russian or US officers who did illegal things. People who only saw the edited version wouldn't just come away with half the question, they would come away hearing an entirely different conversation. "

You could not write that up in a spy novel, Mr Cotton, it's just way too obvious.\n\nRoss is a degree of separation between Trump and Putin's family, but Trump's family has literally zero degree of separation.\n\nIt's kind of unrelated, but given that it's a big deal that this involves Putin's son-in-law, this proximity between Trump himself, in addition to basically everyone around him, is just dots that are so close to one another that they just blur in a mad scribble.\n\nThe suspension of disbelief is incredible. Reality itself is challenged by people who have no integrity and just want to grab everything while they can, knowing that there likely won't be any consequences for it.\n\nEdit: I should add that I should have checked more and while there are many such rumors, Deng being Putin's girlfriend is a rumor. A widespread rumor but a rumor nonetheless. I definitely should have checked more. Still likely, but I'll hold on to making that claim in the future because it needs more substantiation. "

He's consistently attacked American agencies and has never once spoken out against Putin.\n\nThis man does not stand for America. He is not looking out for America's interests.

Consider that Kaspersky labs has been linked to the Kremlin and Russian mafia.  \n\nIn 2013 the Department of State issued a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to 12 US technology companies called Global IT Modernization (GITM) desktop and monitor replacements.  The specs for the desktops include Kaspersky Labs.  Not Norton, not McAfee, and not anything else.  Every desktop sold to the State Department under the GITM BPA has to have Kaspersky malware software installed.  State has been replacing every desktop at every US Embassy and Consulate using this BPA for the last 5 years.  I personally sold more than 4000 to State in 2014 alone.  "

Men like Magnitsky are the true examples of strength in the world."

"> President Trump ordered the firing last June of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation, according to four people told of the matter, but ultimately backed down after the White House counsel threatened to resign rather than carry out the directive.\n\nThat's insane. He *should* be impeached for even attempting to obstruct justice in such a way (but obviously Republicans are too cowardly to choose country over party). This is an absolute **bombshell** report from the Times."
'Recall that in August Kellyanne Conway, John Dowd, and Trump himself all lied in various interviews that Trump had never considered firing Mueller.\n\nTo George Stephanopolpus on August 6th, Conway said “He has not even discussed that... the President has not discussed firing Bob Mueller.”\n\nIn USA Today on the 8th, Dowd: “That’s never been on the table, never ... it’s a manifestation of the media.”\n\nIn response to a gaggle question in Bedminster on the 10th, Trump: “I haven’t given it any thought.”\n\nFucking lying liars.

'Just for those too young or who don\'t understand the details. The first count of Nixon\'s Impeachment Articles was Obstruction of Justice.

Obstruction does not have to be "successful". It merely had to have been attempted, with purpose.\n\nHere is a detailed timeline\n\n\n1. Nixon orders Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General to fire special counsel Archibald Cox, they refuse and resign.\n2. Nixon orders acting AG Bork to fire Cox, Bork does so (but he too resigns later)\n3. Federal court rules firing Cox was obstruction of justice.\n4.

'Okay, I\'ll post this long thread written by Seth Abramson:\n\n>**(THREAD) BREAKING NEWS (New York Times)**: We now know Trump already tried to fire Special Counsel Mueller—7 months ago. Many believed such an attempt would be a "red line" that would lead to impeachment. So what do we do now? I analyze that question and what this news means here.\n\n>**1/** First, here\'s the NYT story. The upshot is that last June Donald Trump *ordered* White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Special Counsel Bob Mueller. McGahn refused and threatened to quit if Trump went forward with the firing. Ultimately, Trump relented.\n\n>**2/** Some will wonder why McGahn had enough sway with Trump to stop this from happening. That\'s a very good question to ask. First, note that McGahn was the attorney from Trump\'s winning presidential campaign, so the two have known each other and worked together for some time now.\n\n>**3/** Next, we have to remember that McGahn is a potential witness—and, importantly, a potential witness *against Trump*—in the Trump-Russia investigation. McGahn was present at nearly all the key moments in the Obstruction fact-pattern that Mueller is considering referring to DOJ.\n\n>**4/** If Mueller refers an Obstruction indictment to DOJ, DOJ will likely refer it to the House Judiciary Committee for consideration for articles of impeachment—and whether or not such articles come out of that committee, America already knows Obstruction is an impeachable offense.\n\n>**5/** It\'s an impeachable offense because it already was for Bill Clinton—per the Republican Party and its votes on impeachment in the House. So while Trump may only have had an inkling of this last June, he likely knew enough to see that McGahn was someone whose loyalty he needed.\n\n>**6/** McGahn is protected from ever testifying against Donald Trump on some issues—but *not* if the conduct he is to be questioned about involves criminal conduct by the president. Remember that Don McGahn does *not* represent Donald Trump, he represents the Office of the President.\n\n>**7/** Definitionally and legally, criminal conduct is not considered within the recognized duties of a president, which means McGahn\'s role as an attorney for the Office of the President diverges from Trump\'s own legal interests as and when the president has acted illegally—as here.\n\n>**8/** McGahn was present before and after the Comey firing, as Trump concocted pretexts for that illegal action and then—afterward—a coverup for what was a *Russia-based* decision to dump Comey. That decision was illegal for the previously cited reason about the office of president.\n\n>**9/** No constitutional provision or U.S. statute ever has—or ever could—authorize POTUS to commit a crime. This means that while Trump *is* allowed to fire Comey because, say, he doesn\'t like Comey\'s dress sense, he\'s *not* allowed to fire him to obstruct a criminal investigation.\n\n>**10/** So McGahn can rather readily be used as an Obstruction witness against Trump, not just because of the Comey firing but much else—for instance attempts to pressure Congressional investigators to drop their probes or attempts to pressure Jeff Sessions into not recusing himself.\n\n>**11/** Trump was represented by Marc Kasowitz last June, and either Trump or Kasowitz would have sussed out that if Don McGahn quit the White House because he believed Trump was about to commit a *crime*—and make no mistake, that\'d pretty much be the basis—it would be a catastrophe.\n\n>**12/** The firing itself would be a catastrophe politically, but if it occurred concurrent to McGahn quitting, the chances that McGahn would be drawn even further into the investigation as a witness against Trump would be *extremely* high. And we don\'t know what *else* McGahn knows.\n\n>**13/** Here\'s the problem: Trump didn\'t back off from firing Mueller because he decided it was wrong or outside his authority or—better still—a federal crime. \n\n>This is a *critical* point: the NYT establishes Trump *only* relented to keep McGahn from quitting as White House Counsel.\n\n>**14/** Indeed, there wouldn\'t have been any story for the NYT to report—this would likely never have leaked—if Trump had simply gone to McGahn for legal advice about firing Mueller, and McGahn had advised him not to do so, and Trump immediately relented in the face of such advice.\n\n>**15/** Rather, the NYT says that—either on his own counsel or someone else\'s—Donald Trump *ordered* McGahn to do something. He did *not* ask for his advice, he *ordered* him to fire Mueller. (It may have been Kasowitz\'s doing, as Kasowitz was urging Trump to go to war with Mueller.)\n\n>**16/** So what we know now is Trump had the criminal intent—mens rea—to Obstruct by firing his *second* person who was then investigating him, but no crime occurred because there was no actus reus (no act). The only reason there was no act was a key witness threatening to jump ship.\n\n>**17/** So Trump thinks he has the *authority* to fire Mueller, that doing so is *appropriate* and *warranted*, and he has the *willingness* to do so. Also (lest we forget) he has the willingness to *lie* about wanting to fire Mueller—as he\'s now been lying about it for seven months.\n\n>**18/** When many many analysts, me included, were saying after Mueller\'s appointment that he needed to be protected ASAP from Trump firing him—because we said that that attempt *would* be made—such concerns were dismissed as conspiracy theory and the bill to protect Mueller stalled.\n\n>**19/** One effect of this breaking news therefore must be immediate passage of the bill to protect Mueller that was *only* not passed previously because the GOP told America—and they were dead wrong—that this president never had and would never have any intention of firing Mueller.\n\n>**20/** But it\'s more than that: Trump was willing to fire Mueller when his level of legal jeopardy was unclear, and Mueller had brought *no* indictments and secured *no* cooperation deals with top Trump national security aides. So what is Trump\'s temperature on firing Mueller *now*?\n\n>**CONCLUSION/** This is the last moment for Republicans to jump off the Trump ship in the eyes of history. Trump is the Titanic and the iceberg is *dead ahead*. He *will* try to fire Mueller—a crime and impeachable as Obstruction. Congress must get on the right side of history *now*.\n\n>**NOTE/** There are other ancillary effects to this story: for instance, Bill Burck *must* now see that he needs to get the hell off two of the three cases he\'s currently working as attorney: Bannon, McGahn, and Priebus. Representing all three is no longer (really never was) tenable.\n'

'So, a couple of important things. \n\n(1) This is a real slam-dunk move from Mueller - note that they Subpoena\'d the trump *organization* and not Trump personally or specific individuals. This means they will have the co-operation of Trump\'s *own employees* for providing evidence against him. \n\n(2) They very likely *already have* a lot of the documents of importance to the case, so people at Trump org. will be working under threat of indictment for lying to federal investigators if they intentionally fail to produce or destroy evidence for Trump. \n\n(3) This is a files and data case; it sounds like issued subpoenas are for documents, not witnesses - although it could be both, and if Trump has been associating with shady Russian figures for some time then that will show in records obtained from Trump Org. staff. However anything Trump gets charged with based on these financial records is more or less set in stone, there\'s no ambiguity of "he said this" or "he didn\'t say this" from conflicting witness testimony. Everything is on paper, and if he (AND his children) laundered money through Trump org. that will be shown here. \n\nThe question remaining is: What did Mueller request? Without a copy of the Subpoena we have no way of knowing what he\'s asked for. Hopefully it will be publicly available soon and then we will know more.\n\nBUT, the subpoena might list the names of people of interest with ties to the Trump association (since they probably requested all Trump org. e-mails, faxes, financial documents and maybe even phone records that have any ties to those people), and that will give us a much better picture of just how broad the scope of the crimes being investigated is and *who* the major players that we don\'t already know about are. It\'s possible (I dare say likely) Trump has been associating with international criminals for some time and there will undoubtedly be financial documents and communications records about (a) The laundering of money out of Kazakhstan (b) Trump tower Moscow; (c) the Trump Soho allegedly used to launder money that implicates Ivanka; and - probably - a lot of other alleged criminal activities).\n\nOverall, a this is a VERY bad sign for Trump. '

Assuming we don’t all die in a nuclear holocaust, our grandkids are going to ask us in disbelief what it was like during America’s soft civil war. People are going to become niche scholars of this era of politics. Mueller is going to have a fucking biopic about him that will sweep at the Oscars 20 years from now. His name will become synonymous with a cold, unflappable pursuit of justice.\n\n\nThis shit is absolutely wild and if you’re not paying attention you should be.\n'

That fails and the people of Alabama pick Roy Moore instead.\n\nRoy Moore turns out to be an even bigger dirt bag than we expected.  Trump backs him anyway.  Moore loses the senate race blowing essentially a 30 point lead.  Remember, Sessions ran unopposed in 2014 and in 2008, won 63.4% to 36.5%.  This results in essentially a 49/51 senate split.  Republicans already had a hard enough time passing bills, losing another vote is going to make it VERY difficult to pass anything.\n\nDon\'t be surprised if the next time you see Jeff Sessions he has a poorly covered up black eye.'

'I\'m waiting to see the election results by county.\n\nThe counties with major cities will be blue. Counties that are dominated by a major college campus will be blue. The counties with large non-white populations will be blue. Everything else will be red.\n\nThe numbers are now showing that *two thirds* of whites voted for Roy Moore. **79% of white non-college graduate men** voted for Roy Moore. Disgusting.\n\nAnd no, this isn\'t an attack on men. 73% of white non-college graduate women voted for Roy Moore, too, and the majority of white college-graduate women voted for Roy Moore.\n\nThis election was won by disenfranchised people of color. Luckily they had *just* enough white allies to win. Moore lost because *just* enough white people stayed home not to vote.\n\nAnd no, this isn\'t an attack against white people. The problem is Southern society (for lack of a better term). White people on the West coast don\'t have these problems. It just exposes Alabama and Southern society for what it is: a society deeply divided by race, where the Confederates, the defenders of slavery, are celebrated, where a senator that is in opposition to Constitutional amendments that protect non-whites get the white vote, where people vote for a pedophile because the president that defends their white-supremacy, using coded language to continue to tell them it\'s the non-whites that are the cause of their problems, tells them to (I\'m willing to bet the votes for Roy Moore are largely made to express solidarity with Trump).\n\nSouthern society is best summarized with Lyndon B. Johnson\'s quote: \n\n> If you can convince the lowest white man he\'s better than the best colored man, he won\'t notice you\'re picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he\'ll empty his pockets for you.\n\nAnd this is what it\'s about -- vote for Roy Moore, even though he\'s a pedophile (a very low man), because Trump said, "Jones, I\'ve looked at his record. It\'s terrible on crime. It\'s bad on the border ...." Anyone that\'s followed rightist rhetoric would realize -- "bad on crime" means "not oppressing non-white people, but especially black people," and "bad on the border" means "not oppressing non-white people, but especially Mexican people." Essentially, it\'s code for: vote for Roy Moore because the other candidate doesn\'t believe you\'re better than blacks and Mexicans.\n\nAnd no, this isn\'t to attack people who *live* in the South. Many people live in the South but were not brought up as a part of "Southern society." If you\'re opposed to Roy Moore and/or Trump, are white, and live in the South or Alabama, I\'m willing to bet you live in an urban area -- ie. you\'re part of a society that has seen much infusion of general American society due to migration.'

'Rape. Donald Trump is accused of rape. \nNot "misconduct" not inappropriately touching. Raping women. He\'s a rapist. \n'
"How the fuck, as a country, are we holding Hollywood to a higher standard than our fucking PRESIDENT?? It's bat shit crazy."
'[ALLEGATIONS](http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-rape-sexual-assault-minor-wife-business-victims-roy-moore-713531) INCLUDE A CHILD, HIS WIFE AND A BUSINESS ASSOCIATE\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been accused of raping a 13-year-old and his ex-wife and attempting to rape a female business associate, among other accusations of sexual assault.\n\nTrump has been accused of rape and attempted rape a total of three times, once involving an alleged victim who was a year younger than Moore\'s accuser.\n\nIn 1994, Trump took a 13-year-old girl to a party with Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire who was a notorious registered sex offender, and raped her that night in what was a "savage sexual attack," according to a lawsuit filed in June 2016 by "Jane Doe." The account was corroborated by a witness in the suit, who claimed to have watched as the child performed various sexual acts on Trump and Epstein even after the two were advised she was a minor.\n\n"Immediately following this rape Defendant Trump threatened me that, were I ever to reveal any of the details of Defendant Trump’s sexual and physical abuse of me, my family and I would be physically harmed if not killed," Jane Doe wrote in the lawsuit, filed in New York\n\nIvana Trump—Donald\'s first wife and mother to Eric, Donald Jr. and Ivanka—accused the president of raping her in 1989. The private account was described in former Newsweek reporter Harry Hurt III’s 1993 book, Lost Tycoon. It details the alleged "violent assault," in which Trump pulled out fistfuls of his ex-wife’s hair after receiving a painful operation on his scalp.\n\n\nIvana walked back her allegations against Trump after his lawyers insisted she write the following statement at the beginning of her book, according to The New York Times: "During a deposition given by me in connection with my matrimonial case, I stated that my husband had raped me. I referred to this as a \'rape,\' but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense."\n\nA former Trump business associate, Jill Harth, claimed in a 1997 lawsuit the New York real estate mogul “attempted rape” and groped her without her consent on various occasions. In the suit, Harth described a violent encounter at Trump\'s Mar-a-Lago resort, in which Trump allegedly threw her against the wall of one of his children’s bedrooms before lifting up her dress.\n\nIt was a shocking thing to have him do this, because he knew I was with George [her partner], he knew they were in the next room," she recalled in an October 2016 interview with The Guardian. "How could he be doing this when I\'m there for business?"\n\nIn the pre-election interview, Harth maintained her allegations against Trump despite having withdrawn her lawsuit against him after he settled a separate suit her partner filed over a business dispute.\n\nMichael Cohen, his former lawyer and top aide, defended him against Ivana Trump’s claims, saying, "**By the very definition, you can\'t rape your spouse.**"\n\nThe president has also been accused of sexual harassment or assault by at least 16 women.\n\n'
"I'm happy to see this in the news again.  I have been reminding people all year and the reactions I get make me feel like no one cares.  Even close friends of mine get annoyed that I bring it up so much but we can't forget that our president is a fucking rapist.  As a sexual assault survivor, this presidency personally affects me on a daily basis regardless of whether or not he succeeds with his agenda.  I can't even imagine the pain that his victims are experiencing.  I know this won't get him removed from office but if no one talks about it, it feels like no one cares.  It eases the pain a bit to know that not everyone has forgotten."

'I was waiting for this. Knew as soon as that fat dumb fuck tweeted about Franken it would be released. Pot. Kettle. Black. '
"I think part of the reason why people have let it go is because everyone knows he is not touchable, for now. His previous sense of being allowed to do it provided one is a star took a big hit after the Hollywood scandals came out, so all he has left is politics now, but that's enough - Trump is literally immune from prosecution, and can delay or settle civil proceedings, while claiming it's just politics when anyone wants to at least talk about it. I personally know conservatives who did not pay him any mind or did not like him...until he was the nominee, and then, suddenly, he could do no wrong. \n\nWhen you are the standard bearer for a party, they let you do it."
'Bloody hell. 17... Is this shit being investigated like it should be?'
'This needs to be reposted over and over until it works. It is ridiculous that this gets swept under the rug whenever it is brought up, and whats even more ridiculous is that men like Weinstein and Louis have had their reputations destroyed when the president has admitted to committing heinous acts of sexual misconduct for YEARS!'
'> Ivana Trump, the real estate tycoon\'s first wife, testified in a sworn deposition during their divorce proceedings that Trump was angry with her for recommending a plastic surgeon he believed had "ruined" him with a painful scalp reduction surgery to remove a bald spot. **Ivana testified that Trump held back her arms and pulled out fistfuls of her hair from her scalp before forcibly penetrating her.** \n\nThis is what the GOP stands for. What they will defend. What they believe in.'
'It is no secret that a lot of people HATE Trump. \n\nIt is also no secret that *accusations* have the power to ruin someones career, and life. \n\nIt is not unfeasible that most of these girls are lying for the purpose of “social justice”. \n\nI am not saying Trump is innocent, I am not saying he is guilty. What I AM saying is that there is no evidence and it is important for us to be fair and unbiased in an issue as serious as this. Moderation is key, and jumping to the conclusion that he is a sex offender is a bit too premature at this point without any testimonies or court cases. Lets wait until we find out more information before making an assesment. '

"
"I love that conservatives keep trying to attack liberals for their creeps, even though the liberals immediately condemn every single one, while conservatives have actual rapists and child rapists as their leaders.\n\nIt's like those cartoons where Wile. E. Coyote sets a trap for Road Runner, but the traps fails. So Coyote runs over afterward and smacks it angrily, getting caught himself."
'I agree 100% I think unfortunately, people only see party. For instance, the same people calling for Trump to be investigated, usually dismiss the rape allegations of Bill Clinton and vice versa. Neither side wants to give an inch when it comes to their "gang". Until America breaks this gang mentality I fear not much will change.'
"The problem isn't *just* Trump, it's [his supporters](https://imgur.com/a/qNoh8) too. The GOP and FOX News have, over the past 20 or 30 years, cultivated what is essentially a modern-day American equivalent of Brown Shirts. This didn't just happen. They put a lot of money and effort into it. And they need to be held accountable when the inevitable crash happens. All of them."

'How does this reconcile with "fake news" outlets, or "propaganda outlets" like Fox News?

'> Suggesting that he would like to see tougher laws over free speech, Mr Trump said that if libel laws "were strong... you wouldn\'t have things like that happen where you can say whatever comes into your head" - referring to Michael Wolff\'s book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.\n\nThen half the goddamn shit Trump spits out on twitter would cause him to be sued.

'"Donald Trump isn\'t like other politicians" has been said so many times but it needs to be said again. He\'s thin skinned and vindictive which means that he acts reactionary and selfishly. Ed Klein wrote outrageous things about Bill and Hillary Clinton but as far as I know neither of them ever wanted to impose limits on his or others free speech because of it (and I\'m wondering if some of the things he wrote weren\'t already clear cut libel). Fire & Fury on the other hand seems much less severe and perhaps better sourced as well and already Trump is jumping for legal action not only against author and publisher but legislative action as well. It\'s been said before, it\'s going to get said again, but Trump is dangerous. '

'Wow! Huge step in Mueller\'s investigation! Isn\'t this the "Red line" Trump has been extremely vocal about warning the Special Counsel they shouldn\'t cross? I wonder if he\'s going to fire Mueller by the end of the week. \n\nWhat I\'m afraid is going to happen is:\n\n1) Trump fires Mueller\n\n2) Trump issues pardons to Flynn, Manafort, Papadopolous, and Gates\n\n3) Trump orders the DoJ to open a new investigation into made-up Clinton and Obama scandals.\n\n4) The GOP - the party of Pedophiles and Sexual Predators - falls into line and remains silent on the destruction of our Democracy, twisting themselves into pretzels to explain it all away.\n\nThat\'s my worst fear. But I think it\'s also an extremely likely scenario. \n\nWe\'re clearly rushing toward a showdown between the administration and the Special Counsel, and it\'s going to come to a head sooner rather than later. Trump is for sure gearing up for a fight, and given Mueller\'s history (and everything we know about him) he\'s not going to go down/back down silently. And all of us, and a floundering Congress, are going to be stuck in the crosshairs as we implore our government to do their jobs. \n\nBuckle up. It\'s going to be one hell of a ride from here. '

'Do you know what kind of evidence you would have to present to a federal judge to get him to sign a warrant to raid the President\'s personal attorney\'s office?\n\nSure, technically the standard is still probable cause. But in reality, holy shit. The evidence they presented to that judge had to be overwhelming.  And the DoJ has many extra procedures you have to jump through, and get approval at the highest levels of the Department, before seeking a warrant on an attorney\'s office.  But the President\'s attorney\'s office?\n\nMy first reaction as a judge would be, "You want me to sign what??"\n\nEdit:  This was a no knock, bust the doors down type of warrant and raid. (See my edit below on this.) So in addition to the probable cause for the search, they had to convince the judge that if they knocked on the door and presented the warrant through the normal course of business, documents would have been destroyed.  This is extreme.\n\nAs Bill Kristol just said: "This is sending a message.  This is war."\n\nUpdate:  They also raided his luxury hotel room simultaneously.  https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/04/fbi-raids-michael-cohen-new-york-hotel\n\nEdit:  The only source for my "no knock" comment was on live CNN TV, on Jake Tapper\'s show.  I cannot find any written source that confirms this as a "no knock" warrant.  So until further notice, take this part of my comment with a grain of salt.  Whether it was or not, is a very minor detail, we shouldn\'t care much about anyway.  They raided the president\'s attorney\'s office and home.  A BFD to use the words of our great former VP.\n\nEdit: 5:31PM Eastern: Wolf Blitzer just confirmed on live TV it was in fact a "no knock" warrant.  \n\nUpdate: MSNBC reporting they\'ve raided Cohen\'s actual home as well.  He was staying in a hotel because a water pipe burst in his home, and was being repaired.  So they\'ve raided his office, hotel room, and home. \n\n**Update:** Jim Acosta: "Trump World sees this as going beyond Mueller\'s authority.  They see this as Mueller has gone rogue. The President is considering what he should do about all of this.  This is very much game on now.  They believe Mueller has gone outside the bounds of this investigation."  \n\nWell guys.  Get ready.  Shit\'s about to hit the fan.  \n\nUpdate: Since this is the top comment, I\'d like to go ahead and clarify some things and clean it up now that we have new information.  \n\nThe general consensus out there is, (although Preet Bharara is skeptical: https://twitter.com/PreetBharara/status/983522446191026177) it appears that during the Mueller investigation, Mueller came across evidence of a crime.  Mueller apparently believed that this crime fell outside of the scope of his authority, and referred the matter to the US Attorney for the Southern District of NY.  This is a federal prosecutor.  (Can be confusing, because of his title.)  This US Attorney is the one that authorized seeking the warrant for the raid (almost certainly with the heads of DoJ, including Rosenstein).  \n\nSo Trump\'s anger towards Mueller is really misplaced in this case.  All Mueller did was stumble upon evidence he wasn\'t necessarily looking for and turned it over to another prosecutor.  \n\nAbout this US attorney, Geoffrey Berman:  It\'s being reported that he\'s a Trump appointee.  That\'s not 100% correct.   Trump has nominated no one, and this acting US attorney has not been confirmed by the Senate.  This is an interim appointment by Jeff Sessions, and this appointment runs out on May 3rd.  \n\nOnce this appointment runs out on May 3rd, the District Court that oversees this federal jurisdiction, has the authority to unilaterally make an appointment.  So this will be very fascinating to watch what happens to this position.  (I\'m not sure the Senate would confirm anyone to this position at this point.  I think the best case scenario is the Court make a temporary appointment.)  \n\nBerman is a former law partner of Rudy Giuliani and a known supporter of Trump.  And that\'s the guy, that approved this investigation and raid.  How overwhelming is this evidence?\n\nSource: https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/federal-agents-seize-communications-of-trumps-personal?utm_term=.ekMbEbxJ4#.tfrJ8JM0B\n\nUpdate: https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/983518970224566272\n\n>Trump\'s public venting about the Cohen raid being an "attack on our country" is "a fraction of what he is saying in private," @maggieNYT says on @AC360.

'Funniest part of this is that the lawyer of the president is getting raided, and the biggest question everyone has is, "I wonder *which* crime we\'re talking about here..."  Is it the threat?  The lie?  Obstruction?  Collusion?  Election fraud?  '
"Any word or speculation yet? Is this about possible illegal campaign contributions? \n\nAha: \n> [So given this Cohen raid is an SDNY investigation referred by Mueller, and not a Mueller action, it would appear there is a SECOND criminal investigation into the president's inner circle.](https://twitter.com/matthewamiller/status/983435496021004290)"
'[Trump responds on video](https://twitter.com/CNNSitRoom/status/983476078265163776).  Transcript:\n\n>So I just heard that they broke into the office of one of my personal attorneys, a good man and it\'s a disgraceful situation. It\'s a total witch-hunt. I\'ve been saying it for a long time. I\'ve wanted to keep it down. We\'ve given I believe over a million pages worth of documents to the special counsel. They continue to just go forward and here we are talking about Syria, we\'re talking about a lot of serious things with the greatest fighting force ever and I have this witch-hunt constantly going on for over 12 months now and actually much more than that. You could say it was right after I won the nomination it started. And it\'s a disgrace, it\'s a real disgrace. It\'s an attack on our country in a true sense. It\'s an attack on what we all stand for so when I saw this and when I heard it, I heard it like you did, I said that is really now in a whole new level of unfairness. So this has been going on, I saw one of the reporters who is not necessarily a fan of mine, not necessarily very good to me, he said in effect that this is ridiculous, this is now getting ridiculous. They found no collusion whatsoever with Russia, the reason they found it is there was no collusion at all. No collusion. This is the most biased group of people, these people have the biggest conflicts of interest I\'ve ever seen. Democrats all -- or just about all, either Democrats or a couple of Republicans that worked for president Obama. They\'re not looking at the other side. They\'re not looking at the Hillary Clinton horrible things that she did and all of the crimes that were committed. They\'re not looking at all of the things that happened that everybody is very angry about, I can tell you, from the Republican side and I think even the independent side. They only keep looking at us so they find no collusion and then they go from there and they say well, let\'s keep going and they raid an office of a personal attorney early in the morning and I think it\'s a disgrace. So we\'ll talk about it more but this is the most conflicted group of people I\'ve ever seen.  The attorney general made a terrible mistake when he did this and when he recused himself or he should have certainly let us know if he was going to recuse himself and we would have used a, put a different attorney general in.  So, he made what I consider to be a very terrible mistake for the country, but you\'ll figure that out.  All I can say is that after looking for a long period of time, and even before the special counsel, because it really started just about from the time I won the nomination.  And, uh, you look at what took place and what happened and it\'s a disgrace.  It\'s a disgrace.  I\'ve been President now for what seems like a lengthy period of time. We\'ve done a fantastic job. We\'ve beaten ISIS. We have just about 100 percent of the caliphate or the land. Our economy is incredible. The stock market dropped a lot today as soon as they heard the noise of this nonsense that\'s going on. It dropped a lot. It was up -- way up, and then it dropped quite a bit at the end. A lot. But that we have to go through that -- we\'ve had that hanging over us now from the very, very beginning. And yet the other side, they don\'t even bother looking. And the other side is where there are crimes, and those crimes are obvious. Lies, under oath, all over the place. Emails that are knocked out, that are acid-washed and deleted. Nobody has ever seen -- 33,000 emails are deleted after getting a subpoena for Congress, and nobody bothers looking at that. And many, many other things. So I just think it\'s a disgrace that a thing like this can happen.\n\nShortly thereafter:\n\n>Q: Why don\'t you just fire Mueller?\n\n>TRUMP: Why don\'t I just fire Mueller?\n\n>Q: Yeah, just fire the guy.\n\n>TRUMP: Well, I think it\'s a disgrace what\'s going on. We\'ll see what happens. But I think it\'s really a sad situation when you look at what happened. And many people have said, "You should fire him." Again, they found nothing. And in finding nothing, that\'s a big statement. If you know the person who\'s in charge of the investigation, you know about that. Deputy Rosenstein -- Rod Rosenstein -- he wrote the letter, very critical, of Comey.  One of the things they said: "I fired Comey." Well, I turned out to do the right thing, because if you look at all of the things that he\'s done and the lies, and you look at what\'s gone on at the FBI with the insurance policy and all of the things that happened -- turned out I did the right thing. But he signed -- as you know, he also signed the FISA warrant. So Rod Rosenstein, who\'s in charge of this, signed a FISA warrant, and he also signed a letter that was essentially saying to fire James Comey. And he was right about that. He was absolutely right. So we\'ll see what happens. I think it\'s disgraceful, and so does a lot of other people. This is a pure and simple witch hunt.\n\nRemember, folks: [NOBODY IS ABOVE THE LAW—MUELLER FIRING RAPID RESPONSE](https://act.moveon.org/event/mueller-firing-rapid-response/search/)\n\nedit: linked directly to tweet with video, added the last few lines about Sessions.\n\nedit2: Added a few more lines at the end, and the Q&A where he\'s attacking Rosenstein by name, courtesy of [WaPo\'s annotated transcript](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/04/09/trumps-tirade-after-the-michael-cohen-raid-annotated/).'
"My suspicions are that the $130,000 was laundered money.  That's why Cohen has been claiming it's totally his, and why Trump was saying it was all from Cohen, even though he knew it would invalidate the NDA.  Because invalidating the NDA is the least of his troubles if the $130K was laundered rubles."
'Quick thread on what is important here and to try to answer some obvious questions as I\'ve been thinking and absorbing the very smart people I follow on twitter : \n\n\n[Mueller brought this to Rosenstein, and Rosenstein felt that SDNY should carry it out](https://twitter.com/davidjoachim/status/983449041529982976). That might mean that Rosenstein viewed it as unrelated to the Mueller jurisdiction, or it might mean something else caused it, we don\'t know. We also know its Federal, so its not a State-crimes that people are always going on about. \n\nThey raided Cohen\'s home, his hotel and his office for documents. (Much like with Manafort) Some of which related to Stormy Daniels. Its unclear what was obtained, if anything, related to Mueller\'s work. If something IS obtained related to Mueller\'s work I imagine that will be handed off to Mueller. [This was a court authorized search, meaning there was sufficient probable cause for a federal judge to agree that a search involving the President’s personal attorney could occur without any advance notice to Cohen.](https://twitter.com/S_Fitzpatrick/status/983445154056073221) FBI is currently [reported to still be on-scene at Cohen\'s hotel. ](https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/983453302305296385)\n\nNow with Stormy they [could be looking into Cohen possibly hire people to threaten her](https://twitter.com/MichaelAvenatti/status/982599066260353025), they [could be looking at the financial involvement of payments](https://twitter.com/jimrutenberg/status/973217581409632256) or also [try to determine if Trump himself knew. ](https://twitter.com/MichaelAvenatti/status/983080338057580544)\n\nOn the Russia side of things, if this is actually related to Mueller then it could be about the [Peace Plan with Sater and Flynn](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/us/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-russia.html), or it could be about [the Trump Tower Moscow deal that never took off](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/08/the-curious-link-between-trumps-moscow-tower-deal-and-a-ukraine-peace-plan/) or it might even be related to the claims in the Steele Dossier, that he was paying off hackers. At the very least the recent news of Stormy payments adds plausibility to the idea that Cohen pays off Trump\'s problems. An odd coincidence if Steele wasn\'t aware of Stormy or other situations of Cohen doing this.\n\nWhether crimes are related to either of those, both, or neither, the evidence gathered can be used for either case if its related. And any new crimes that turn up might lead to completely different problems for Cohen/Trump. \n\n[Trump\'s been watching the reports, so it\'ll be fun to see his reaction either way.](https://twitter.com/stevebruskCNN/status/983444351660560384)\n\nBonus note : [Attorney-client privilege is voided in an investigation when you use that privilege to further a crime or fraud.](https://twitter.com/Tom_Winter/status/983448336970764291), and the FBI strictly sets up teams to avoid causing problems with Attorney-Client privilege situations. \n\nUpdate 1 : [The firm Cohen partnered with last year has dumped him and is fully cooperating with the FBI. ](https://twitter.com/dfriedman33/status/983457389126078464)\n\nUpdate 2 : [Michael Cohen is under investigation for possible bank fraud and campaign finance violations, a person familiar with case tells WaPo.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/fbi-seizes-records-related-to-stormy-daniels-in-raid-of-trump-attorney-michael-cohens-office/2018/04/09/e3e43cf4-3c30-11e8-974f-aacd97698cef_story.html?utm_term=.8d5a1c72dcfe)   \n\nUpdate 3: \n\n[Trump goes on a rant which you can watch here](https://www.cbsnews.com/live/video/20180409222835-senior-military-officials-brief-trump-about-the-incident-in-syria/) " So I just heard they broke into the office of one of my attorneys, good man, and its a disgraceful situation its a total witch-hunt I\'ve been saying it for a long time I\'ve wanted to keep it down, we\'ve given, I believe over a million pages worth of documents to the Special Counsel.

Its an attack on our country in a true sense its an attack on what we all stand for so when I saw this and when I heard it - I heard it like you did, I said that is really now on a whole new level on unfairness. \n\n"So this has been going on, I saw this on one of the reporter\'s who was not necessarily a fan of mine, not necessarily very good to me he said in effect that this is ridiculous this is now getting ridiculous.

'Update just now from WP: [Trump attorney Cohen is being investigated for possible bank fraud, campaign finance violations, according to a person familiar with the case.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/fbi-seizes-records-related-to-stormy-daniels-in-raid-of-trump-attorney-michael-cohens-office/2018/04/09/e3e43cf4-3c30-11e8-974f-aacd97698cef_story.html?utm_term=.d66edff9f815)'
'Wow, they are freaking the fuck out over at Breitbart. Calling for the military to step in and arrest every member of the FBI and DOJ...'
'Just to preemptively counterract the “mueller has gone rogue” narrative:\n\nIt looks like mueller found something on Cohen that was outside the scope of his investigation. He referred it to rod rosenstein, who thought it was significant enough that he assigned it to the US atty for the sdny (who happens to be a trump appointee). The US atty got a warrant and then executed it with this raid. Mueller may have set the ball in motion on this, but if it wasn’t legit, there were many points in the chain where it would have stopped. \n\nAlso re: atty/client privilege—there is a crime fraud exception to the privilege rule, which basically says that the privilege doesn’t apply to criminal conduct. So, when they got this warrant they likely had evidence that cohen had broken privilege by engaging in criminal activity. '
'Wow. Trump compared this FBI raid *to an attack on this country.* Trump is basically stating attacking him is attacking America itself. The narcissism of this douche.'
'Hillary is in deep shit now. And I can imagine just how bad this is going to make Obama look.'

'Just checked Fox News. Tucker Carlson is currently making the claim that tech is more harmful than opioids for degrading American society. \n\nUpdate: how will transgender people running the marathon affect women?\n\nUpdate 2: are pandas sex crazed killing machines???!!! - this was a direct quote. '
"This is a constitutional crisis.  The president has the option to veto laws; if the veto is not used or overriden, that means he has no choice but to enforce them.  Otherwise there's no point in having a Congress at all.\n\n...and it's incredibly fucking transparent that this is all about servicing Putin."
"Passed with a veto-proof majority. Trump chose not to veto, chose to sign it into law, and even with the terrible optics of not enforcing sanctions on Russia with the Trump-Russia controversies swirling - I don't see how Congress can't act on this. Otherwise, it turns into some ultra-veto that they have no power to overcome, and makes the Executive branch far too powerful. \n\nWe're witnessing a slow coup and the murder of the rule of law."
'The republicans are on record in so many interviews after this was passed stating that refusal to enforce sanctions would result in a constitutional crisis. Some even hinted at it would lead to impeachment.\n\nI can\'t wait to see how they spin this. I hope I\'m wrong, I hope they do something but I\'m doubtful with all the events happening today that -appear- to lead to a massive amount of gaslighting.\n\nedited for some videos:\n[Someone should tell Rex I guess?](http://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2017/10/15/sotu-tillerson-russia.cnn) At the end he claims how they fully intend on implementing sanctions as congress intended.\n\n[Someone should tell Pence also, unless I missed Russia "reversing the actions that caused sanctions to be imposed in the first place."](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4679109/pence&start=101)\n\nThere\'s more. I remember CNN interviews a couple months ago where the Rs were pushed with leading questions that they still agreed that sanctions would happen or the president would be punished. I\'ll try again when I wake up to find them.\n\n[McConnell in early 2017, "Absolutely opposed to lifting sanctions on the Russians, if anything we oughta be looking at increasing them."](https://youtu.be/S5hDasbOBPA?t=3m26s) Immediately after he dodges the question about what he would do if Trump lifts/doesn\'t enforce. Why wouldn\'t he just say he would instead of dodging? He\'s implying there would be a punishment.\n\nIn regards to wondering whether the president intended to follow the law passed and signed, [“If they don’t cooperate, then further actions need to be taken,” Sen. John McCain (R-AZ)](https://www.thedailybeast.com/congress-trump-wont-implement-russia-sanctionsand-he-wont-tell-us-why). That pretty heavily implies something would be done to force him to act or else.'
"Today the Trump Administration announced that they will decline to enforce the sanctions placed on Russia by 96.64% of Congress. We are in the midst of an unprecedented constitutional crisis where the executive branch has failed to carry out the bipartisan will of the legislative branch.\n\nThe rule of law means nothing to this administration and without harsh sanctions on Russia, there's nothing to deter them or any other foreign power from interfering with our future elections. Shame on anyone who still defends Trump."
"The week we find out 430,000 fake Russian twitter accounts were retweeting him, and days after we find out Russian Facebook accounts set up thousands of dueling political events to pit Americans against each other, and the same day the CIA director says Russia is activly trying to influence the 2018 midterms, **he's saying he's not going to enforce sanctions that more than 98% of both houses of Congress agreed on. **\n\nThe kompromat must be real. I can't think of any reason to do this. The president is refusing to punish our adversaries, against the advice of senior diplomats and the justice department, against the conclusions of the defense department and the intelligence community, and now he's basically telling Congress to screw themselves.\n\nWe have a crisis, folks."
'This is by far the worst of the awful news trio we got today.  Congress must grow a pair tomorrow or never.'
'soo... its now painfully transparent a foreign government has literally more say so in our executive branch than the entirety of congress and all of its constituents. this is the worst shit in a long time. '
'Friends. This is what we call treason. Remember when the GOP threw a bitch fit over Hilary’s emails? We now have a president who is refusing to enforce a sanction passed by our Legislative branch thus actively defying our Constitution. If you claim to be a supporter to the right to own a gun under the second amendment, then this right here should upset you. We should all be upset that we have a leader that does not respect the checks and balances of our government. The exact law that was made to avoid tyrants, dictators and kings from ruling the land of the free.'
' Following the brazen, [undisputed attack on our election](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/12/13/a_brief_guide_to_russian_hacking_of_the_us_election_132556.html) by Russia, [the Trump executive branch has refused to enact](https://www.google.com/amp/www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/01/29/trump-administration-wont-levy-new-russia-sanctions-for-now.amp.html) the overwhelming and [shockingly bipartisan will of the legislature](https://www.npr.org/2017/07/27/539864048/russia-sanctions-headed-to-trumps-desk-will-he-sign) (99.04% approval). \n\nThis is an unprecedented constitutional crisis. Not only is it blatant contempt for the rule of law, but it strikes a massive blow to our national security by opening the door for future election interference by hostile foreign actors. \n\nMany stronger, less divided empires have fallen before us. Do not think for a moment we are the exception; famous last words, and all that. Our country is changing in dangerous ways, and if we do not rise up now we could see constitutional governance die within our lifetimes. Stand. Up. Start something in your area. Find other people. Demand action. '
'This decision basically tells us:\n\n"Why have laws?"\n\nWhat\'s the point in having any sort of law and order if our own President won\'t follow them? Fuck, what\'s the point of all of this if NO ONE (in the majority) below the President in power will punish him for a lack of caring?\n\nI want to say that these midterm election commercials write themselves, that sanity will restored come November. But let\'s face it people: We ain\'t making it to the midterms at this rate. Change is gonna have to happen sooner. '
"Honestly I'm so discouraged right now. This entire presidency has felt so draining, it's a constant stream of bullshit and I feel like it's hopeless to think anything is actually going to change. Every single day it's something new, so many people aren't even trying to be informed, and those who are all have outrage fatigue. I don't even know how to conclude this comment, this whole situation sucks. "
"I don't care who you support, this isn't ok by any means. The President is refusing to enact a law that passed. Breaking the checks and balances of our system is an attack against the country."
'So does the protesting start now or does nobody yet give a fuck that a fascist dictator is sitting in the White House? '
"So a President who's under investigation for possible connections with a Russian effort to get him elected is refusing to enact a wildly popular bill that would negatively harm Russia. If this isn't an admission of guilt I don't know what is."
'Im tired of the \'Mueller rapid response\' plan. Tired of \'be prepared\'. Why "be prepared"? Why not now? Why do we draw a line in the sand but ignore transgressions a hundred feet past the line? Trump ignored the law, and violated it. He defied his oath and constitution. He is robbing a bank while the security guards (GOP congress) turn a blind eye and point to the getaway car. This is worse than firing Mueller. Far worse.\n\n'
'I’m going to feel like an eternal fuck head for not voting in that damn 2016 election.\n\nPolitical apathy, not even once. '
'What blows my mind about this all is that the baby boomers, who tend to follow the GOP blindly, lived through the cold war and saw Russia as an enemy. \n\nNow that Russia is engaging in cyber warfare, it\'s okay with them? Just as long as they are right and the "stupid libs" are wrong? What the fuck is going on'
"This really does prove Trump is compromised without a doubt. This is just the final nail in the coffin. \n\nI used to think it was just some of Trump's associates, like Gates and Manafort who colluded with Russia. Now, I really have to believe Trump was involved too. Whether it be because of his years in business with the Russian Mob and money laundering or just because of some stupid pee tape.\n\nTrump is clearly in Putin's pocket. \n\nCoordinating with the GOP in Congress to obstruct the investigation doesnt help his image either. Makes him look even more guilty. Makes the GOP look guilty. \n\nI honestly hope the Dems, FBI, and DoJ all release shit as this drags out. The Republicans wants to run this country with their minor majority in Congresss despite representing fewer people? Fuck them. FBI and DoJ have a duty to investigate. The elected Democrats have a duty to represent the majority of this country. "
"Well, after all that talk, here we finally have it.  A constitutional crisis.  The president of the US is refusing to follow the law that he signed.  \n\nHe's not going to the court to argue its legality. He's not making a case to congress that it's no longer needed and pushing for a repeal.  He's not doing anything that acknowledges that this law was passed.  He waited until the second deadline was passing, and just isn't going to do the things the law requires, because he decided otherwise.  Simply dismissing a law that's been enacted properly is possibly the worst thing he can do in terms of constitutional responsibilities.  He's not even going to acknowledge his responsibility, putting him above Congress.\n\nHe just broke his oath of office completely."
'in my opinion, this is the worst thing Trump has done yet (which is saying a lot).  This is so blatantly Unconstitutional and if anyone had any doubt in there mind that Russia had something really horrible on Trump, this should eliminate that doubt.  \n\nTrump is 100% compromised.  He is certainly working toward the benefit of Russia and not for the American populace'

'Some Russia bots appear to be adopting a new line about "y u wanna make Russian people suffer with more sanctions?" to appeal to the left\'s humanitarian side. It\'s bullshit and don\'t fall for it. The Russian population did suffer as a result, but all self-inflicted by Putin: the ban on Western food products that Putin enacted in 2014 as retaliation for the Crimea Sanctions and the ban on adoptions of Russian children, also enacted by Putin as a retaliation for the Magnitskiy Act. Read up on the latter, it\'s fucking disgusting, the kids from Russian orphanages that were being adopted by American families were the most sick and fragile. So the Russian people have less food options and the most vulnerable of their orphans will be dying, all because Putin\'s is unhappy his friends can\'t stash their money. What Russia has to offer to the West is insignificant, so they\'re doing their best to play to their opponent\'s humanity. I\'m a Russian expat and the brave line I get from the patriotic friends and family members is that "no one gives a shit about sanctions", so this is the bed they\'ve made for themselves, don\'t listen to these sad stories for a second.'

'Before anybody tries to pull the "it\'s a containment board" nonsense, banning /r/FatPeopleHate actually [worked very well](http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/cscw18-chand-hate.pdf). \n\n>In this paper, we studied the 2015 ban of two hate communities on Reddit, r/fatpeoplehate and\nr/CoonTown. Looking at the causal effects of the ban on both participating users and affected communities,\nwe found that the ban served a number of useful purposes for Reddit. Users participating\nin the banned subreddits either left the site or (for those who remained) dramatically reduced\ntheir hate speech usage. Communities that inherited the displaced activity of these users did not\nsuffer from an increase in hate speech. While the philosophical issues surrounding moderation (and\nbanning specifically) are complex, the present work seeks to inform the discussion with results on\nthe efficacy of banning deviant hate groups from internet platforms.'

'its not a pro trump sub, its a propaganda sub whose sole objective is to spread hatred and disinformation, at least partly motivated by outside entities.\n\nkeeping it going is to accept this fact and is a endorsement of the damage that these groups are currently doing to the USA and the west in general. this stuff is not low level, its genuinely dangerous, both for whipping up hatred on a local level and on a more broad geo political stability level.'
"Crappy article buries the lede: T_D broke every rule we have. They botted, they doxxed, they brigaded, they harrassed.

To what extent remains to be seen by the end of Mueller's investigation, but the fact that you've all resorted to using that whole ordeal as an excuse to ban platforms where people you don't like who think things you don't think and say things you wouldn't say merely because of those reasons is fucking weak.

But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant."*\n\nKarl Popper, the paradox of tolerance'

Does one of those death threats actually have to be acted upon for something to be done?  Are we waiting for Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer to be shot?\n\nHow much more false news articles that are promoting an armed insurrection need to be posted before something is done?  How many more articles that are patently false and promote violence need to be posted?\n\nReddit has surpassed The Daily Stormer, Storm Front, and Free Republic as a white supremacist recruitment forum.  While YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook try and take some responsibility for their content, reddit has decided to double down and basically admitted they will do nothing, and it up to us as users to report the offending content and those reports will not be acted on.\n\nHow many of you have reported a post from an alt-right subreddit for being violent? I know I have, I end up doing it at least once every time I load /r/all, but those reports go to the moderators of those subs, who not only condone this behavior, they participate in it.\n\nGo to /r/stopadvertising /r/againsthatesubreddits or any of the other many subs devoted to getting the admins to act.

'I lurk in there sometimes to see what his supporters are saying and have seen numerous times them talking about being violent towards groups they disagree with, and have seen posters saying their white supremacists talking about how black people are genetically inferior to white people. \n\nIt reminds me of the alt right subreddit that use to exist I linked posts from that subreddit to here and the sub ended up getting banned.

I tried as hard as I could to be civil but as soon as they realized I supported something they didn't want to admit was spreading ignorance I was banned. I'm all for them not being supported by Reddit but once T_d goes down then the flood gates open. they are still going to have accounts to be able to spam hate into whatever threads they possibly can.

">Just before the stroke of midnight on September 20, 2016, at the height of last year’s presidential election, the Wikileaks Twitter account sent a private direct message to Donald Trump Jr., the Republican nominee’s oldest son and campaign surrogate. “A PAC run anti-Trump site putintrump.org is about to launch,” Wikileaks wrote. “The PAC is a recycled pro-Iraq war PAC. We have guessed the password. It is ‘putintrump.’ See ‘About’ for who is behind it. Any comments?” (The site, which has since become a joint project with Mother Jones, was founded by Rob Glaser, a tech entrepreneur, and was funded by Progress for USA Political Action Committee.)\n\nThat doesn't seem like the actions of an independent website looking to post unbiased information for all to digest to me."
'[Former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti:](https://twitter.com/renato_mariotti/status/930188261657628677)\n\n>At one point, Trump Jr. accepted a password to a website from them. If he used the password to access the website, that’s a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.'
"Well it must be true.\n\n[Roger Stone is throwing a fit on twitter again](https://twitter.com/account/suspended)\n\nGuess he doesn't like being painted as a treasonous bitch"
">It is the third reason, though, Wikileaks wrote, that “is the real kicker.” “If we publish them it will dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality,” Wikileaks explained. “That means that the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing on Clinton will have much higher impact, because it won’t be perceived as coming from a ‘pro-Trump’ ‘pro-Russia’ source.” It then provided an email address and link where the Trump campaign could send the tax returns, and adds, “The same for any other negative stuff (documents, recordings) that you think has a decent chance of coming out. Let us put it out.”\n\nThese guys were such utter slime and so transparently an arm of Putin.  It's a shame how infested reddit and facebook was with their shit for all of 2016."

So dishonest! Rigged system!”\n\nwow, that's some really inconvenient timing"

As he explained it, he did so out of revenge.  An infant suffering from seizures and cerebral palsy who, without health insurance, would die.  He did this out of revenge to hurt the child's parents who had a legal dispute with Fred Trump's estate.\n\nDonald Trump thrills at the idea of showing people how far he will go for revenge.  The idea that he would harm a child to get revenge almost sexually excites him because of the ruthlessness of it lets you know what a formidable opponent he is.  He wants you to know he will stop at nothing, holding a child's life hostage, to get his pound of flesh."
"Wow the man who on the campaign trail said he wanted to murder the families of terrorist doesn't have respect for human decency and innocent children? WHO COULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING?!"
"Just saw Trump on tv saying how horrible this situation is and how he wishes these laws weren't in place... like what in the actual fuck?? This is a new low for these idiots. I can't believe half that country is so stupid that they put their faith in these crooks when they are literally lying to them with every breath "
'One word needs to be underscored every time this is discussed: ***deterrence***. This is a *policy* of deterrence. This has been said by White House Chief of Staff Kelly *and* Attorney General Sessions.\n\nWhat that means is we are separating children from their parents—tormenting and scarring these children—*to send a message* to other potential immigrants who would dare think of coming to our country. We are using them as pawns without regard for their safety or mental well-being. Children as young as one year are being taken from their parents. In a word, we are *monsters*. This policy is actual evil on display for all of us to see, and it is being done in our names.\n\nThe president lies when he says that this is a "democrat policy." It\'s not. It\'s *his* policy. Jeff Sessions has contradicted the president in recent days, and John Kelly preempted him about a year ago when he said he was considering this policy as a "deterrent." Further, the Republicans—the president\'s party—control Congress. They alone can pass a law tomorrow ending this policy, and he can sign it. He can call for them to do this. He has not done so. Even further, the president himself can direct his administration to *not* follow this policy. It has been around since the Bush administration. Neither Bush nor Obama enforced it, as was their right, and as is president Trump\'s right. The president is a coward for not admitting that this is *his* policy and that he is *choosing* to enforce it.\n\nThis administration makes me sick.'
'Every news site is plastered with crying faces of immigrant children, unfortunately this is exactly what Trump’s base wants to see. There is a fundamental fear and disdain for non-whites, and what the media is displaying is just further evidence that they made the right choice in voting Trump. '
'This is really sad and wrong. '
'Scumbag Trump and The Spineless GOP Congress are EVIL'
"This revelation puts Ryan's actions in delaying or refusing to bring an immigration bill to the floor, and Trump's quick veto threat on it when Ryan could no longer hold into perspective. Paul Ryan passed up a legislative victory, so he could play his role and abet the WH in kidnapping small children from their parents. These people are fucking sick. "
'This made me so mad I donated to the ACLU. '
"Every new pathetic thing that Trump does desensitizes the country to the next act of outrage and petty cruelty. I find it hard to understand why can't Congress agree to do something. There is nothing family values, law and order or conservative about the policy. It is just petty cruelty... The kind of cruelty a kidnapper would possess while making away with someone's child from their helpless parents. \n\n"

"My husband is military. The first time I was on base and this came on, the hell I knew what was happening, but fuck me if I didn't follow everyone else's lead. \n\nThis is a perfect example of arguing for something you don't know anything about. If you, as commander-in-chief, are going to bitch about NFL players not respecting our flag--and our soldiers, veterans, and fallen--then you better damn well set an example for everyone, every time. \n\nEdit: turns out I spoke too soon. Courtesies vary from branch to branch. The regulations I cited below are for army (which I might still have misinterpreted) and not the air national guard.

"Just about every single fellow veteran I have on Facebook, who ran like hell alongside me to avoid standing for Colors, is now adamant that players stand for the anthem. It's kinda hilarious."

"As a veteran, this pisses me off way more than a private citizen not standing for a football game anthem playing.  I'm normally pretty chill about things, but this is going too far into disrespect.  Granted, it's not something that really affects him being president; just another piece of evidence in the Trump is a piece of shit pile."
"Is anyone really surprised? He's slack, lazy and, above all, a stinking & ineffective hypocrite."
'When reading the quote of him saying "Are they playing that for me?" I thought for a second that the article was just making a joke. There\'s no way someone could be so ignorant and stupid. Watched the video and was horrified to find out he actually said that. Although I probably should know better by now.'
'Ugh what an embarrassing time for America'
"Come on then Trump supporters...you were simply *furious* when others did it, when *others* disrespected the flag.\n\nSo how furious are you now? Oh let me guess, it's suddenly magically different? Suddenly not offensive or disrespectful?"
'How the shit can Trump scream fake news all the time, and then praise and sit down with Hannity. '

"Confirmed: Trump's problem with the protest isn't the protest itself, but who is protesting or what is being protested.  Either Trump is openly against Blacks having the first amendment or openly for police brutality."

I\'ve seen maybe 20 responses like this.\n  \nResponders are saying "only stupid people would believe this, we should educate them" "did anyone really believe this stuff?" or "as Abraham Lincoln said, don\'t trust everything you read on the internet." It\'s an attempt to completely redirect from the massive disinfo campaign to make the conversation about if people are stupid and "we have to educate people" -- putting the onus on American people instead of Russia and the campaigns who allowed this.   \n  \nIn my opinion it doesn\'t even matter if people believe the posts (they did... and shared the hell out of them) what matters even more is that Russia undertook a campaign, a full-frontal cyber assault on democracy. Just a remarkble note I read in today\'s NYT: 150 Million people saw the Russian Facebook ads. And additionally the Russias operatives created 80,000 posts that were shared across the networks.\n  \n'

According to the Journal\'s report, Clifford began talking with ABC News in the fall of 2016 for a story involving an alleged relationship with Trump, but reached a $130,000 deal a month before the election, which prevented her from going public.\n\nTrump\'s longtime attorney Michael Cohen arranged for the payment through Clifford\'s lawyer, Keith Davidson, the Journal reported.\n\n\nFollow the Trump Administration’s Every Move\nIn a statement to the Journal, Cohen did not address his role in negotiating the supposed payment but said Trump denies any such relationship with Clifford. Clifford has previously denied an alleged relationship with Trump.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, the White House issued a statement calling the Journal\'s story "old, recycled reports, which were published and strongly denied prior to the election."\n\nCohen also accused the Journal of perpetuating "a false narrative for over a year."\n\nJust days before the 2016 election, the Journal published a story stating that the National Enquirer — run by David Pecker, a fervid supporter of Trump — had paid $150,000 to silence former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal about a sexual relationship she allegedly had with Trump a decade ago.'
"This Stormy Daniels scandal would have been a legacy-defining scandal for any other President since Nixon.  For Trump, it's just a expositional footnote for how bad his first year has been.  Assuming there isn't anything illegal with the payoff (cmon Eric Trump's Charity!!!), this will be forgotten by this time next week."
"The reason why this is problematic (if true) is that it exposes him to blackmail because he was cheating on Melania. \n\nAside from the blackmail angle, I don't care about him cheating on his wife or banging a pornstar because it was all consensual. The 16 or so other women accused him of non-consensual abuse, which I do care about."
'One more scandal that would normally be huge and likely lead to the resignation of every single president before, if true.\n\nBut this will all be forgotten by tomorrow or whenever the next major dumpster fire lights up.'

That's not an exaggeration. And no law student in that position would ever consider taking such a position because they would know they aren't qualified. And that's what's so bad about this bastard.

'Up next, President What-The-Fuck-Are-You-Going-To-Do-About-It claims any and all reports of him ever using the phrase Fake News are Fake News. '
"After he had been unequivocally told in an intelligence briefing that Russia had hacked the DNC, Trump said in a nationally televised debate:\n\n> I don't know if we know it was Russia who broke into the DNC, [Clinton is] saying Russia, Russia, Russia. Maybe it was. It could also be China, it could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.\n\nHere's what Trump said after talking to Putin:\n\n> He said he didn't meddle. He said he didn't meddle. I asked him again. You can only ask so many times.  Every time he sees me, he says, 'I didn't do that,' And I believe, I really believe, that when he tells me that, he means it.\n\nRegarding the potential for Putin's involvement in the hacks:\n\n> Somebody did say if he did do it, you wouldn't have found out about it. Which is a very interesting point.\n\nAfter Facebook disclosed Russian ad activity, Trump said on Twitter (Sep 22 2017):\n\n> The Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?\n\nAgain after being unequivocally briefed that Russia was meddling in the election, Trump said:\n\n> I don't know. I've been hearing about it. I've been reading about it. I think it's probably unlikely. I think maybe the Democrats are putting that out, who knows? But I think that it's pretty unlikely, but you know, who knows?\n\nShortly after the hacking, Trump said:\n\n> We believe it was the DNC that did the 'hacking' as a way to distract from the many issues facing their deeply flawed candidate and failed party leader.\n\nAnd so on, and so on.  Trump's statements are often such a mangled word salad that it's hard to ever say he definitively said anything, and when he does he has no problem going back on it (such as finally accepting that Obama was born in the US), but over and over again he established a pattern of trying again and again to cast doubt on the very notion that Russia meddled in our elections, despite every intelligence agency in the US unequivocally stating, over and over, that they did.\n\nWhich begs the $11 billion dollar question: why the *fuck* has Trump gone so far out of his way, at considerable political cost, to protect Vladimir Putin?"

Is anyone going to keep pressing SHS on this past an initial fumbly answer about debating facts or whatever manages to fall out of her mouth?\n\n\nAs the latest Mueller charges show, it's time to start holding people's feet to the fire on this. The time for being satisfied with recreational outrage over the Trump Administration is over. We *know* a hostile foreign state interfered with our elections. We *know* that at a minimum, one of their goals was to sow political discord. We *know* that they have accomplished that goal. There is mounting evidence that they favored one candidate over the other and took steps to get that candidate elected.

First, it describes an organized effort to mislead the public — not to spin, or minimize the story, or distract from it, or throw out wild accusations about someone else, but to intentionally fool everyone into believing something false. Second, it implicates the president himself. Indeed, the most extraordinary part of the picture this story paints is that while other people involved were recommending some measure of transparency on the assumption that the truth would come out eventually, they were overruled by the president, who personally dictated the misleading statement.\n\n'
"It feels like watching an ever strenghtening Hurricane that just hasn't made landfall yet, but if it does it will obliterate everything."
'Wait a minute.  Didn\'t he fire Comey admittedly to stop the Russia investigation?  Hasn\'t he consistently denied that any Russia (i.e., hacking of election) scandal exists? Seems to me, Trump was already "directly implicated in trying to cover up the Russia scandal" months ago.  This is just more evidence.  '
"Dictating a shitty public lie for Jr. is only like 3,000th worst thing he's done in the last year."
"From GOP: I'm concerned by this new information.\n\nFrom right wingers chatting the world around: Bullshit, where's the proof? Total nonsense.\n\nFrom Trump Twitter: See above right winger. \n\nFrom Fox: Another immigrant stole some groceries after raping 64 at church in small midwest town."
"And?  Not a damn thing will happen.  I'm so sick of this bullshit.  Watched an interview with some Republican senator this morning and he was already blowing this off.    \n  \nI see why Trump thinks he's bulletproof because right now he is.  Nothing seems to matter.  He could come out and say 'I colluded with Russia' and nothing will happen.  \n  \nI have lost all faith in the American political system, it's a joke. "
'Stupid Watergate strikes again. '
"Wasn't he pretty directly implicated when he said on national TV that he fired Comey because he (Trump) was thinking about the Russia story?"
'With every news article that comes out about Trump\'s BS, I just have to say:\n\n# Ok, so now what?\n\nFor all the blatantly illegal or immoral shit he does, I\'ve yet to see anything come of it. Don\'t get me wrong, I WANT something to happen. I want his ass out, and I\'m sick of the "well vote him out in 2020" response. Because if that\'s the only option then why even bother building up all this talk of scandals and investigations if nothing will come of it?'
"I don't know how this should be surprising anybody at this point. I mean, even things like the golf putt. Maybe the Mooch *meant* 33 feet, but he *said* three. I mean, something as dumb as that was changed in official documentation to meet some kind of penis envy narrative. For what fucking reason? I mean, cant we rely on transcripts to be accurate? Words just don't fucking matter anymore.\n\nThis Whitehouse is showing over and over that they are not truthful to the American people. They are more worried about dictating narrative than doing the right thing. They change fucking White House official fucking transcripts to try and make the guy look better? \n\nWhile there are many more examples of this bullshit that are way more important, that putt incident is one tightly packaged example of how this administration is corrupt as fuck. People associate them with the Kremlin, because they are doing things that we would expect the Kremlin to do. Well, and all the other evidence.\n\nThis is just recockulous."
'His stupidity has no bounds; stupidgate continues.'
"Lying to the public isn't obstruction of justice.  Firing the FBI director for investigating you is."
'honestly is anyone even the least bit surprised at this point.\n\nThis mother fucker has consistently managed to get below even my lowest of expectations.\n\nSuch a fucking miserable failure in every possible way.  \n\nI would urge you all the seriously get out and vote your asses off in every election you can vote in.'
"Trump voters are also trapped on this issue.\n\nIf he's guilty, well... The GOP now would have really elected a Russian built Robot Nixon.\n\nIf he's innocent, the man is probably the dumbest thing alive for not just running off to play more golf and ignore it. "
'SHS spinning this as fake news right now is just painful to watch'
'For all the nonsense about "4D chess", Trump seems to play the game exactly like I do -- address the immediate problem using the first move I think of, completely oblivious to the fact I\'m backing myself deeper into a corner.\n\nI mean fuck, has anyone in the Trump camp actually considered how it will look of the investigation concluded everyone was *innocent*? He\'s done so much lying and firing and threatening and rmeddling that anything exonerating him will just look hopelessly compromised.'
'The real problem is when a real crisis hits, this fool will be in charge.'
'One wonders why Trump, his team and his "good boy" go through Cirque du Soleil level mental gymnastics, ever changing justifications and explanations for what they keep saying is a "nothing burger". \n\nOne would wonder why a group of people lies so much about something that is apparently no big deal. \n\nDon\'t worry Trumpers, I don\'t expect a coherent response from you.  '
'How did he not get directed implicated in the cover-up when he admitted he fired James Comey because he was investigating the Russia scandal?'
'Lies beget lies, and you have to remember what lie was told by whom to whom.  It is a mess for Donnie Jingles.'

'Fuck this administration. Fuck Russian influence. Fuck every sycophantic hypocritical kowtowing piece of shit in power that allows and encourages this to go unchallenged. No one has forgotten or moved on from this fight. The time will come when they will feel the blowback and I honestly hope it takes the form of old school stocks. Lock em up in the public square. Charge a dollar a grape to throw at these fucks. Use the donations to help reunite the separated families from the border. Or for healthcare. Or for municipal projects like the flint water atrocity. Let’s truly make America great again by taking the disadvantaged under the wing of the our collective financial disgust and turn something horrible and making it a positive. '
'In October 2016, two Russian guys got drunk in a bar where I was hanging in Pattaya, Thailand. When the news about US election showed up on TV one of the guys turned to me and yelled out in broken English that Trump raped and killed a 13 year old girl in Moscow and Putin had the evidence. Maybe it’s not just a pee pee tape...'
"Trump's (and most Republican politicians') stance towards Putin's Russia is indeed a betrayal of the US, its democracy and the democratic rights of US citizens. These protests should continue as long as Trump remains in office."
'Fuck Trump, fuck conservatives, fuck single issue Republican voters, fuck the alt-right facists, fuck the Keklords who thought voting a walking meme into office to "own teh libruls" was a good idea.\n\nFuck every single one.\n\nI live in Hawaii, feel so sidelined.  I would show up to these protests if I could.  Godspeed and good luck people.'

"Guys, we need to remember that both sides are imperfect, ok? So what if he's a rapist, adulterer, and confirmed liar? Obama eat dijon mustard. *Dijon*..."
"When this was predicted, by anyone with common sense after the first month, I wrote to Representative Comer and Senators McConnell and Paul to address this specific problem.\n\nPaul:  no answer\n\nMcConnell: Thanks for your input.\n\nComer (who replied to an email I never gave his office): I want to protect taxpayer dollars, but as long as they're consistent with per diem rules, they can do that.\n\nSo I got back a hot pile of shit and a violation of my privacy. Go gummit.\n\n"
"because of Trump's lavish playboy lifestyle   1/3 of  Secret Service protective force has reached their overtime limits for the year and now every extra hour they work is essentially free. Trump has found a way to stiff workers again.\n\nRemember when the right complained about Obama's date night in DC and the travel cost of official state visits?  The right are vile, dishonest and anti american. I did nazi this coming.\n\n"
"I can't wait for this bullshit to end. "
"Don't assign him a security detail, nothing of value would be lost anyway"
'So basically: Trump runs for office because he\'s on dire straights financially, wins because "promises", spends the next year blaming everyone for his shit policy, spends every weekend vacationing on the tax payers dollar.   \n\nGreatest con of all time.  '

"The secret service doesn't need its budget to be increased. The fucking president needs to stop wasting money and time on vacations! Fiscal conservatism my ass!  "
"Can we take a minute to think about the level of rage that would be induced if Obama did this? How are conservatives twisting this into a 'so who cares'?"
"My brother in law yesterday was talking about how bad he feels for Trump because he's constantly in the spot light, and he feels Trump needs to be able to take a step back to breathe that the American people are putting too much pressure on him...\n\nWhen I asked him about all the golf outings he's been on he said that was more business than pleasure...\n\nI just can't wrap my head around this kind of mind set..."
"Hmm. So there's no money left to pay the agents *who protect him*. That is sad. I think he should keep the status quo going...what's the worst that could happen? /s"

"NPR and PBS stations in any city will be just fine. NYC, SF, Miami, Dallas - no problems finding funding there. \n\nIt will kill the small stations though. All throughout the midwest, rust belt, the south. They will never be able to raise enough from the small populations there. \n\nIf you've ever listened to those small stations, they relay crucial weather reports, local road conditions, whose cattle escaped last night - where they may still be loose.\n\nGood job Trump, hurt those who voted for you - yet again."
"Man, fuck that. That's an absolutely minuscule part of the budget and if you're going to run up the kind of deficit you've been bitching about, you don't get to then selectively say we should cut off the crumbs given to actual valuable programs."
"Every day, Trump sullies the office of President and the dignity of our nation. He is an insult to decency, morality and patriotism.\n\nWe have placed in our highest office a proudly ignorant, racist, mendacious, hypocritical jackass. He's a traitor, a liar, and a criminal.\n\nThe only part of his legacy that won't be dripping with shame and revulsion will be the tiny bright spot that he brought Republican hypocrisy and greed for power at any cost into the sunlight.\n\nShame on us as a country for having allowed this beast to slouch his way into power."
'http://www.businessinsider.com/study-watching-fox-news-makes-you-less-informed-than-watching-no-news-at-all-2012-5\n\nFox News viewer score lower on current events testing than *those who watch no news at all*, while NPR viewers score at the very top.\n\nI do wonder how conservatives square this. Either liberals are smarter for unrelated reasons, and despite knowing more things and understanding things more accurately are nonetheless terribly terribly wrong about everything, or liberals are smarter because "liberal media" makes them that way. It\'s not exactly flattering no matter which way you cut it, is it? \n\nOf course, we know the answer. They will decry the poll itself as "fake." Meanwhile, for the first time in the history of the Pew poll, a majority of republicans think higher education is a *bad* thing. That\'s no coincidence. When your entire worldview is based around denying objecting reality, your ire is bound to turn on its most ardent proponents: journalists, scientists, and now, academic institutions.'
"There will be blood on my hands if anything ever happens to PBS.\n\nGrew up poor with no cable and PBS was all I watched for years and still continue to watch/donate. It gave me entertaining kids shows as well as educational documentaries and news segments. \n\nEdit: Guess I should've noted that I'm not literally going to kill or harm if PBS is defunded."
'Education is the enemy of fascism. Remember that and nothing the Republican party does will seem mysterious.'
"Of course. The last thing Trump or the GOP wants is an educated population. Keep 'em stupid, misinformed and angry at poor brown people.  "
"I cannot argue with NPR being left leaning based on topics alone. They're much more likely to listen to a victim, worry about the argument, or wait to hear more facts before jumping to conclusions.\n\nI can argue with someone comparing it to Fox News. I fucking hate that shit so much.\n\nPBS is amazing and has no negatives that I can think of."
'Eh, Republicans always do this. Romney famously said he\'d cut funding for PBS and got slimed for wanting to kill Big Bird. It\'s more of a *wink wink nudge nudge* "let\'s eliminate funding because teehee I dunno, just kidding" kind of deals. '
'From the article: \n“The elimination of federal funding to CPB would initially devastate and ultimately destroy public media’s role in early childhood education, public safety, connecting citizens to our history, and promoting civil discussions — all for Americans in both rural and urban communities.”\n\nGreat. Welcome to America under Donald Trump and his corrupt buddies. America is being destroyed from the inside out. It started in 1913 when the Federal Reserve Act was signed. It ends when free speech, and freedom of information are completely stifled, which is coming very very soon. While we all post pictures of our food on instagram and argue with each other over Walking Dead episodes on Facebook, your sneaky and evil government has been undermining your freedoms and setting the groundwork to finally pull the rug completely from underneath us. \n\nThey passed the patriot act, no problem. They let the NSA spy on us, no problem. They passed the DARK act, no problem. They passed NDAA multiple years in a row, no problem. What will it take to have Americans outraged and actually stand up for themselves? At this point, I think Americans would trade their last bit of freedom for a free big mac at mcdonalds. Shame be on us, woe is America. '
'Fred Rogers\' corpse claws itself from the grave and reveals a heretofore unknown savagery as it staggers into the white house and shits in Trump\'s mouth, moaning "It\'s a beautiful day in the neighborhood".'
'NPR listeners and PBS watchers, constantly top every yearly poll on informed viewers/listeners.\n\nwhich is why republicans despise it and call it liberal. Which is laughable since its PUBLIC broadcasting. You can get on either pbs or npr with a conservative show.Just no one there wants to listen to you spew bullshit'
'I am just shocked, shocked I tell you! I never thought that Trump would stoop to such lows!'
"No funding for public educational broadcasting but churches continue to get tax breaks? Jesus fucking christ it's so fucking obvious he wants to keep the public stupid and docile. "
'So if privately owned news networks are bad due to their bias, and publicly funded networks are bad due to being "unnecessary" to the budget and also biased... how are we supposed to stay informed?'

'I hate how some people make this a military veteran issue. These people are not kneeling because they disagree with the military and people who serve our country. '
'I wish instead of divisive bullshit about a fucking anthem even right wing lunatics and Trump himself could not recite by heart, we gave these fuckers a test about American history and current facts. I seriously fucking doubt they would know even 10% of the basics about this country. They claim patriotism but they are fucking morons. There are cab drivers in Azerbaijan that know more about America than these assholes.  '
"I don't always agree with you lot (in fact, I usually get negative votes thanks to you lot) However, this bugs me and I think we can agree.\n\n\n**This was never about the flag**. It's crazy to me how the entire discussion has changed to revolve around Trump. We shouldn't let him control this issue. IT'S ABOUT POLICE VIOLENCE AGAINST CITEZENS. That's what it's protesting. \n\n**Also, Kapernick actually got the idea from a VETERAN**. And as a vet myself, I am not offended. I am not the flag. The flag is not what I served. It's a piece of cloth. Anyone claiming that this disrespects me or my friends is a fool. Don't speak for me. I don't know any vet alive that is upset over him kneeling. Even vets that like Trump don't care. This is a distraction.\n\n\nThis entire thing is stupid, and I am hating the media for giving this attention. Just report that it has nothing to do with disrespecting veterans or the country, and it's about police violence against black men (and other races too). And put an end to this dog and pony show. \n\n"
'WTF.. this happened today? Did they pass out the suicide koolaid afterwards too? \n\nAmazed. It seems *VERY* cult-like.'
"It appalls me that people are having their First Amendment rights violated by Trump and the GOP. America's no longer a democracy. It's a fascist flavored idiocracy."
'Lets cover the details: \n\n- No Eagles players knelt during this past season\n- Even if they had, Trump could not bring himself to admit to why\n- Trump is a multi-time draft dodger who disrespects military veterans and families when he isn\'t lying to them\n- He could even recall the words to God Bless America at his "patriotism" event which was patriotism theater to cover his own shame of not being liked by football players\n- There weren\'t Eagles fans at the event even though Trump says the players abandoned their fans. \n- Trump only reveals his deeper lack of care for the military when he uses them as props. They are ALWAYS props. '
"Holy shit I didn't know he had a little event about the national anthem lol.  What a petty little bitch. "
'Trump is utterly disrespecting the national anthem by using it as a political weapon in this pathetic staged event.'
'Admitting your country has flaws and wanting to work to address them is true patriotism. Wasting your timing whining about who worshipped the flag hard enough is some dumb, hayseed bullshit '

'He pleaded guilty on October 5th! A lot could have happened between then and now.\n\nI smell a plea deal. Papadopoulos is just over 30. He has a lot of life at stake to fuck up with the wrong actions today.'
"Of course, trump is tweeting already\n\n > Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????\n\n>  ....Also, there is NO COLLUSION!\n\nBut her emails..."
"This is THE news of the day, and it's currently getting buried by Manafort's tax bullshit. You have a turned campaign official admitting russian involvement, lying to the fbi about it, and now cooperating. This is fucking monumental, historic news.\n\nTrump has no fucking clue who he's up against. He's hopelessly outclassed."
"Well boys, we're on to him!\n\nThe feds are going to use Papadopoulos, Gates and Manafort to squeeze the vice down on the Podestas. Then we use the Podestas to get Hillary and eventually Chelsea. Once we twist the arm behind the back of Chelsea, she'll squeal on Obama\n\nHe'll be forced out from hiding and we'll get that fucking birth certificate! It's Mueller time, Barack!"
"A few quick things for anyone who doesn't understand how big of a deal this is. \n\n* He pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI SPECIFICALLY in regards to communications with Russians in an attempt to obtain dirt on Hillary Clinton. Including setting up meetings.\n\n* The charges, and situation surrounding his guilty plea seems to imply that he has flipped and is cooperating with the FBI.\n\nManafort and Gates were indicted on crimes related to Trump-Russia in a way, it was certainly involving large amounts of dirty Russian money but there were no charges DIRECTLY about collusion its all indirect through dirty money and possible influence of RU parties on their actions. THIS however is DIRECTLY about collusion. And if he has flipped, and was integral to the whole scheme of collusion, then this is a huge deal. \n\nAlso something to keep in mind with this charge, and the charges on Manafort and Gates is that these charges are something that are HIGHLY probable to be mirrored with other individuals in this investigation. Flynn would likely end up with FARA charges, as well as lying to FBI. Trump family has endless shady business deals, Kushner as well, Kushner lied about countless foreign contacts.  Nothing seen today is a one-off. This is just the beginning. "

Tweet your reps.  AG Sessions sat on national tv and lied to the American public.  He needs to be forced to resign."
"I'm not an avid poster in r/politics... I'm a liberal but I just lurk.\n\nThis is the biggest thing in this entire investigation, without a doubt. This directly connects Trump to Russia. The Russia investigation has been promoted to very plausible based on this complaint by the FBI. If you read the complaint it is insane how connected this guy was to Russia"

This is corruption in action.'

I mean, there is some shady ass shit going on and this needs to be rooted out by a good journalist.\n\nEdit: Oh, and did I mention the company is listed as a woman owned business (it's not) and it shows it has only had one government contract in the last two years?

He's not a good president, period.

'What a fucking farce of an administration this is.  The goddamn [Department of Defense has been saying that climate change is a security risk to the United States and its Armed Forces for years now,](https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/612710/) but the president chooses to ignore them.\n\n[Here\'s another article about how the Pentagon has continued to prepare for the threat of climate change despite our dumbass president\'s decision to dismiss the issue.](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2017/09/12/pentagon-is-still-preparing-for-global-warming-even-though-trump-said-to-stop/)\n\nWhat\'s the point of spending billions upon billions of dollars to bolster our military if we\'re just going to ignore their warnings?\n\nThe White House says that climate change should be ignored, and the country\'s focus should instead be on the economy and on border security.  Guess what, jackasses?  When our coastal cities get hit by more and more hurricanes, that will have an adverse effect on the economy.  And it wasn\'t just Puerto Rico that got devastated by hurricanes this year. States whose electoral votes went to Donald - Texas and Florida - got hit, too.  \n\nClimate change doesn\'t only target blue states.  Voters who are being hurt by the effects of climate change are going to remember how this administration ignored the issue.\n\nAlso, when other nations around the world are severely harmed by extreme weather, drought, famine, and other things caused by climate change, does the White House think their problems will not affect us? There won\'t be more refugees trying to enter the US, legally or illegally?  \n\nShit that\'s this obvious to a schlub like me should be obvious to our country\'s top officials.  But they won\'t do anything about it because they\'re either too ignorant to realize how bad the situation is, or they\'re too beholden to the fossil fuel industry, God-crazy evangelicals, or other special interest groups that don\'t like climate change discussion.  Too bad there isn\'t a super-wealthy lobby called "Save the Fucking Planet" that can outspend all the others and finally get both parties to work together on climate change.\n\nThis should not be a partisan issue.\n\n**Edit:**  [Here\'s the Department of Defense\'s 2014 Climate Change Adaptation Roadmap.](https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/Downloads/CCARprint_wForward_e.pdf)\n\n'
'People need to start thinking why Donald Trump thinks this way.  It\'s not based on science or reasoning.  It\'s based on self interest.\n\nLet\'s ignore the donor angle and just talk about Trump himself.  He\'s a land developer.  You know who he fights with on every project?  Departments like the EPA.  They wouldn\'t let him do whatever he wants when building a development, building, or golf course.  Departments like the EPA have cost him millions of dollars if not more.  He probably has abandoned projects because of the restrictions imposed by these types of departments.  So he sees them as being in his way.  He can\'t make as much money and do what he wants, so he kills these departments so he can.\n\nThis is all so transparent, yet people continue to go back to the "Donald Trump is stupid" narrative.  I\'m not sure how smart or stupid Trump is, but we know he\'s all about himself.  This is proven.  So stop trying to just brush everything off as "Donald Trump is a moron" and start thinking "Why would Trump do this?  How does it benefit him?"  More often than not, it either benefits him directly or he just doesn\'t give a shit about it and uses it to gain favor with donors or other senators (and their donors).'
"It's not just a national security risk but a global security risk. \n\nInternational leadership of US under trump has already completely collapsed "
'Globally, about 12.6 million people die each year due to environmental risk factors such as pollution, extreme weather or climate-related disease, according to the World Health Organization.\nBetween 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause 250,000 additional deaths per year around the world, according to the WHO - including in the United States. :( '
'The dumbest, most foolish president in history and the whole world will pay the price for us putting him in office. '

'And the list grows of what Trump has undone from the Obama administration.  I seriously believe this man is trying to erase any history of a black man was President.  \n\n#The economy\n\n* Withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The trade deal would have established a trade partnership between the United States and countries on the Pacific Rim. \n* Revoked a rule that expanded the number of people who could earn overtime pay.\n* Reversal of a rule that would mandate that oil and gas companies report payments to foreign governments. The Securities and Exchange Commission will no longer receive this information.\n* Stopped a rule that would require large companies to report worker incomes by race and gender. The rule was aimed at reducing pay disparity.\n* Reversed an interpretation of the Civil Rights Act that provided protection to transgender workers.\n* Ended a rule that barred employers from taking some or all of the tips given to service employees.\n* Canceled a rule mandating that financial advisers act in the best interests of their clients.\n* Ended a rule that allowed consumers to file class-action suits against financial companies.\n* Ended limits on the ability of states to drug test those seeking unemployment benefits.\n* Reversed a policy allowing states to develop their own work requirements for welfare recipients.\n* Revoked an executive order that mandated compliance by contractors with laws protecting women in the workplace. Before the 2014 order, a report found that companies with federal contracts worth millions of dollars had scores of violations of labor and civil rights laws.\n* Repeal of a rule allowing states to create retirement savings plans for private-sector workers.\n* Appointed Mick Mulvaney, a fierce opponent of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to serve as its interim leader. Mulvaney once said the Bureau was a “joke.”\n* Blocked implementation of a rule that would have made it easier for farmers to sue big agricultural companies.\n* Repeal of a bill that mandated that employers maintain records of workplace injuries.\n* Removed information about worker injuries from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration website.\n* Killed a rule mandating that government contractors disclose past violations of labor law.\n\n#The justice system\n\n* Rescinded a President Obama effort to reduce mandatory sentences. Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered that prosecutors seek the most stringent penalties possible in criminal cases.\n* Canceled a phaseout of the use of private prisons.\n* Reversed restrictions on providing surplus military gear to police departments. Those restrictions were implemented by the Obama administration after the unrest in Ferguson, Mo.\n* Reversed a ban on civil forfeiture. Law enforcement officials are now once again able to seize assets from suspects who haven’t been convicted of any crime.\n* Reversed the government’s position on a voter ID law in Texas. Under the Obama administration, the Justice Department argued that the law had discriminatory intent. Under Sessions, Justice withdrew that complaint. On Wednesday, a federal court threw out the law.\n* Reviewed Justice Department efforts to address problematic police departments. An effort to address concerns in the Baltimore Police Department was delayed.\n* Requested a review of the convictions of Blackwater guard for killings of unarmed Iraqi civilians in 2007. At the time, Blackwater’s CEO was Erik Prince, brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.\n* Overhauled and scaled down the Department of Justice and the State Department.\n\n#The environment\n\n* Withdrew from the Paris climate agreement.\n* Blocked the Clean Power Plan. The plan implemented under Obama focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. In October, The Post reported that the administration would seek to repeal it entirely.\n* Suspended a rule limiting methane leaks from drilling on federal land. Methane is a much more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.\n* Ended a study on the health effects of mountaintop-removal mining. The process involves blasting away the tops of hills and mountains to get at coal seams under the surface.\n* Rescinded a rule mandating that rising sea levels be considered when building public infrastructure in flood-prone areas.\n* Reversed an Obama ban on drilling for oil in the Arctic.\n* Announced a reduction in the scale of several national monuments. In April, Trump signed an executive order ordering a review of monuments added in the past 20 years, opening up the possibility that some areas previously set * aside would have that status revoked. Last month, Trump announced plans to reduce the size of two, one after lobbying from a uranium company.\n* Ignored a deadline to implement a rule regulating smog.\n* Withdrew a rule regulating fracking on public land.\n* Announced plans to reconsider controversial protections for the sage grouse in western states. The bird’s habitat has been reduced as sagebrush has been removed in places that are being developed, often for oil and grass drilling. While not officially endangered, conservation groups worry about the sage grouse’s fate.\n* Postponed an EPA rule that would have had chemical plants better evaluate and inform the public about possible safety issues. This decision, made in June, drew new attention after Hurricane Harvey flooding led to an explosion at a facility near Houston.\n* Rejected a proposed ban on the pesticide chlorpyrifos. The month after this decision, a group of farmworkers were sickened by exposure to the chemical.\n* Reversed a ban on plastic bottles at national parks.\n* Repealed a ban on lead bullets. The bullets were banned under Obama because the lead can poison wildlife.\n* Rescinded a limit on the number of sea animals that can be trapped or killed in fishing nets.\n* Delayed and potentially rolled back automotive fuel efficiency standards.\n* Began repeal of a rule that would weaken emissions standards for some truck components.\n* Repealed the Waters of the United States rule. This rule expanded the definition of water bodies that were protected by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n* Ended a rule banning dumping waste from mining into streams.\n* Reversed a rule banning hunting bears and wolves. The ban applied to federal refuges in Alaska and prohibited hunting predators using certain methods.\n* Repealed a rule that would have overhauled the federal land management process.\n* Removed more than a dozen academics from the EPA’s Scientific Advisory Board.\n* Removed a bike-sharing station at the White House.\n\ncontinued below as I hit max characters.\n\n[Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/08/24/what-trump-has-undone/)'

"We can put this monument on the coast—say off Miami—and have its base equal to the lapping waves of high tide. As sea levels rise, the monument will begin to be submerged, at increasingly greater depths. It will become a symbol of the cynicism, stupidity, and folly of our age. And it will be important for future generations to know who was responsible for this failure of action and imagination as this global crisis crescendoed."](https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/vvy9na/dan-rather-climate-change-denier-monument)'
"The world is fucked because of America.

'How do people not see that he is owned by Russia?\n\nIts so fucking obvious.  He is owned (literally, they probably own him financially) by them and their interests in drilling in the Arctic for oil.

He moves around some words on a page in a way that's highly unlikely to ever have any real-world relevance, in order to keep the liberal outrage machine focused far away from the ongoing, far more serious matters.\n\nHe's also trying to exhaust that outrage machine, so that people become jaded and deadened and the will to impeach isn't there when the actual serious news comes out - that he's a bought-and-paid-for Russian agent."

Now he’s calling for MORE REPUBLICANS. \n\nLike, look, I’m a registered R, I’m more libertarian than anything, I love my guns, think weed should be legal and prefer small government. The fact that this guy wants just ONE PARTY edges us closer to a fucking tyrannical dictatorship. His attacks on the 1st amendment, the press and his obvious, disgusting support for state-run media say as much. \n\nI’m so absolutely disappointed in our government today. I love my country, but I really hate this government. \n\nSorry, if anyone actually reads this, I’ve been holding this in for a while and needed to get it out.'
'What an incredible waste of a Congress and Executive office. We are being divided and compromised as the turtle recludes in his shell and a criminal leads us to self destruction. Wake up. The GOP cannot lead shit. Trump is a fraud. We need to wipe them out in 2018-2020'
'Republicans still have the gall to blame the Democrats while controlling the entire government. How pathetic. '
'But, but, the Dems are the reason the Republicans have no idea how to govern.  Also, **MEMO!!** Release all Memos!  About Everything!  ANYTHING!\n\nDistract!  Redirect!!  Obfuscate!!!\n\nSadly, the now necessary /s'
'In addition to #TrumpShutdown crushing it at #1, the four top story threads are\n\n1.\tTrumps face & details about the shutdown\n2.\tDonald Trump Jr. tweeted 30+ times about releasing the memo but he doesn’t actually understand the memo & the memo is bullshit. Trump & republicans can just release the memo whenever they want, but it’ll just be a memo written by Numbskull Nunes with nothing to corroborate just to try & discredit Mueller.\n3.\tDuetsche Bank flagged suspicious transactions by Jared Kushner & will give them to Mueller.\n4.\tA story about how the current billionaire president cheated on his 3rd & current wife multiple times just after the birth of his 5th child and then paid her only 130k to sign an NDA that his lawyer set up by using shell companies & alias’ in Delaware so the money couldn’t be tracked. \n\nInsane'
"* REPUBLICANS let CHIP expire and refused to refund it.\n\n* REPUBLICAN President Donald Trump ended DACA with no failsafe\n\n* REPUBLICAN President Donald Trump rejected a DACA proposal with bipartisan support at the last-minute after initially agreeing to sign it. That proposal was the culmination of 4 months of work.\n\nRepublicans created this entire mess. Blaming Dems now is like blaming your injuries on the guy who didn't rescue you after you crashed your own car."
'This thread is amazing. It\'s like a non stop lazy river of "conservative" tears. Your boy really fucked up this time.'
'But Obammmmmaaaaaaaaa :( :( :('

'What is he fundraising for, exactly? His campaign? The GOP? Is it normal for a potus in his first year to hold so many campaign events & do fundraisers? He spends most of his time golfing, being at his clubs, tweeting, and holding rallies, than he does anything else. \n\nEdited to add, can’t forget watching tv. Watching Fox. He is the most useless person in the Country. '
'What\'s the bet that now the tax bill is through the republicans don\'t really need him to do or say what they all really mean. So they really will "lock him up" as in keep him hidden away with his fox news on 24/7, tell him how he\'s their "favorite" President and only roll him out to spew some racist BS or whatever so he can take the blame and outrage while they all sit back and shake their heads while ruining America. '
'Omg ha! I went for a run today and saw the presidential helicopters on their base. I had to reroute due to secret service but a little down the path there were protestors. It was music to my ears :) but point of the story... fuck this guy, this city hates you '
'In a just world millions would be crowding the streets protesting these digusting tax reform bullshit and Trump’s gutting of the government. \n\nFrankly it’s time for a revival of socialism in America fuck the bourgeoisie '
'**DISCLAIMER - I want Trump gone just as much as the average redditor**\n\nBut, I mean, this is sorta laughable.\n\nWowwwww all 16 people there yelling on that corner. \n\nWhy do we as Americans suck so badly at protesting lol this is a joke '
'LOCK HIM UP is right. He needs to go to court (we are not heathens like those who voted for Trump, they wanted Hillary locked up without a proper sentencing), and be found guilty, and then go to prison'

'Feed a man for a day, and he won’t be hungry until the next.  Let him starve and hold a flamboyant military parade and he starves to death. '
"I mean, shit, the military budget if cut in half and re-appropriated correctly could solve a lot of suffering among the working class but the rulers don't care. How about even the GOP Tax Bill that is nothing but a plundering and pilfering of the poor and a gift to the rich?\n\nAnother example, take even the Panama Papers. The takeaway from that is, without question, *your* wealth has been taken from your pocket, and given to an ultra-minority elite who hide it beyond public reach for their own ends. All needless suffering and hardship is the direct consequence of this gangster racket and their international heist.\n\nBetween Trump's parade, the military budget overall, the GOP Tax Bill and examples like the Panama Papers from an international perspective there is no question that our livelihoods and dignity directly conflict with profit for the rich.\n\nYou should take that personally. The rulers don't give a fuck about you.\n\nEDIT: Direct*ly* conflict."
'I... didn’t even know this parade was actually going to happen. I thought it would be another moronic trumpian outburst that went nowhere, because *why the covfefe would it?*\n\nI’m exhausted with having to debate and deconstruct every fucking crazy move this thin-skinned pseudo-despotic asshole makes.'
"If he does this fucking stupid dictator's parade and you show up, fuck you."
"I don't support the parade at all but I always think these kind of comparisons are unfair. You could say this for pretty much any expenditure of money you don't agree with to make it sound bad "
"These men aren't war heroes. They have no homes! They're only heroes because they served in the Armed Forces. Sad! I prefer men who have homes. They are the real heroes."
"I didn't even know they're going to give this fucker his stupid fucking parade!  Jesus, what is wrong with America??"
'The worst part about the parade is that it shows MAJOR WEAKNESS. Our power is that no one knows what we have but they expect it’s superior. When we put it on display, it can never be as large as people imagine it is, which makes us look weak, and it shows that our leader has a need to show off for the world, which is weak. \n\nThis guy is so fucking stupid. '
"But feeding homeless veterans doesn't do anything for Trumps dick measuring contests.\n\nand besides, he only likes veterans who didn't get captured or end up homeless. Because IF he had gone to war, he totally would have kicked ass left and right with NO weapons. just his bare tiny hands.\nOnly pussies and losers get captured or lose both legs.\nIf these homeless veterans weren't so lazy and useless, they could have gotten a small loan of a few millions from their daddies and made something of themselves."
'A parade is a dumb idea, but the article is as dumb:\n\n>Using the most conservative estimates available from federal agencies and non-profit organizations, Newsweek found Trump could completely eliminate hunger among homeless veterans, *serving them three meals a day, for at least 14 days.*\n\n10 million could feed a bunch of people for two weeks, what a shocking revelation. '
"I always saw military parades as what desperate dictators do to create fear among their people.  Somehow Trump's version is even sadder than that. "
'The fact that we don’t properly take care of fellow Americans that served in the military is so disgusting and shameful and this isn’t a new phenomenon. You fought in battle you will most likely suffer from PTSD so you will need to be compensated for it. Many of these homeless vets have mental and drug problems why can’t we provide them with all the help they need instead of giving a tax break for the rich? '
'Trump is a piece of shit who is ruining America.\n\nWe know this.\n\nNow what are we going to do about it?'
"I'm a moderate conservative, and I also think the Parade is stupid. Military parades are for countries who feel inferior to others, there's no need for this display in the US, what are we trying to prove anyways?"
"What is the point of this parade? Everyone knows that the US has a large and powerful military and it will just be a waste of taxpayers' money and also be pointless since we are not really celebrating anything like an end to a war, etc....?"
'Holy shit this peace of shit fascist is having a military parade?!!!'
"It is hard to describe in words how idiotic this man really is. In a picture it would be that Jackie Chan picture raised to the 100th power. A man who has avoided  military time is having a military parade with American tax dollars. Every day it is something new with him. Hollywood couldn't write this shit. "

'I still don\'t understand how CK, Weinstein, Spacey, Franken, etc all have accusers and are either dropped or have investigations ongoing; but Trump is somehow immune when he openly admitted to it with audio...\n\nEdit: too many people to respond to that are wondering about what audio there is. So let me say this, I am in fact talking about the "grab them" quote. I know that it may have been what you call "locker room talk," but it should be taken seriously due to the accusations that he has been linked to. Don\'t defend him by saying that women would consensually let him do it because he\'s rich, that\'s a poor argument and just plain lazy because you aren\'t inside the heads of women that have accused him. '
'>For Trump and his press secretary to continue to push the false agenda that the women are liars and continue to so cavalierly defame private citizens is outrageous and improper.\n\nFucking seriously. I made this comment earlier, but I\'m posting it again.\n\nEvery time there is a new accusation all I do is wonder why the human with the highest position and most power in the country/world is being held to a lower standard. Just a few hours ago people were calling for Frankens resignation. People are losing their jobs and being ousted from society for much less than the President has been accused of FOR DECADES and ADMITTED to. What is this madness? I keep seeing, "it all comes down to the power they have over these woman." He\'s the PRESIDENT. What more power could you ask for? How did you listen to that tape, read these allegations, vote for him, and then condemn everyone else?\n\nEvery time there is a new accusation Donald Trump should be brought up immediately. It should be beaten to death on every station. I hope it blows up and these victims also get their justice.\n\nI really feel, as the article stated, that this is boiling up to a point where it will be impossible to ignore. I hope so at least. \n\n>It’s been simmering on the stove with the lid on, like a pressure cooker. But now the heat’s on and it’s going to boil and the lid is going to blast off.\n\nKeep bringing it up and insert his name into every article of accusation on others...not as deflection, but to remind everyone of the standard we are holding them to and keep it fresh. Trump would love for it to disappear.\n\nIf there was even a whisper that Obama possibly joked about raping someone or any other "locker room" talk the republicans would burn this country to the ground and you\'d never hear about anything else. \n\nAs a Republican that voted for this man, how do you reconcile the differences and sleep at night?          '
'"We don\'t care."- Republicans\n\nIt\'s been a week and they *still* haven\'t officially backed away from a ~~pedophile~~ **child molester**.  A snowball has a better chance in hell than the likelihood Trump will be held accountable.\n\nEdit: child molester, not pedophile. Thanks for pointing out the distinction, we do need to be correct in our terminology.'
"CNN and MSNBC should just do what Fox does.  Pretend these are new stories about women coming out to talk about Trump's sexual assault.  Plaster headlines with it, interview the women, 24/7 Trumpgate.  Everyone seems to be held accountable right now except for him."
"and they're absolutely right.\n\nThe Elephant Slayer might think he's dodged these charges, he's wrong. One way or another.... he's going to face the music for these. "
'I believe the woman who accused trump of rape in 1994 (when she was 14) was bullied and sent death threats until she ultimately let court throw out the case. Trump supporters said that was proof she was lying and said there was no evidence (after over 20 years?? surprise). She came out anonymously but people still found her identity. I think about that every time I read about the resident honestly.'
'First, the accusers need to[ run the gauntlet of death threats](https://theweek.com/speedreads/659256/attorney-trump-rape-accuser-cancels-first-public-appearance-because-death-threats) aimed at them.  Which is a sick reality in itself.'
"It's both unnerving and unsurprising to see this constantly resurface and then disappear in the same day.\n\nMy wife asked me earlier this week if the accusations ever led to anything and I honestly could not answer her.  She only asked me because she could not find an answer on her own.\n\nI know I'm useless for these things so it was bad that she had to ask me."
'This is as good a time as any to remind people that Trumps ex wife is on court record accusing him of rape. Violent to the point that he tore some of her hair out and bruised her'
"GOP won't tolerate Bill Clinton's clear abuse of power to get sex but refuses to address Trump's long history of assaulting, abusing, disrespecting and objectifying women. What a bunch of fucking assholes. "
"This is the sad truth. Republicans literally only care about the politics of it. They don't see human being, they see potential voters with R's and D's next to their names.\n\nSure they will act like they have a conscious sometimes, but only when it makes a Democrat look bad or costs them financially.\n\nUnfortunately in the world of politics, Democrats are at a disadvantage because we hold our people accountable and will not blindly vote for a pedophile or sex offender. (for instance)\n\nRepublicans fake the moral high ground constantly while secretly planning to screw middle and lower class families, to appease rich donors.\n\nI used to say that both sides are the same so who cares... but this simply isn't true, at least not anymore. Republicans have shown that they will do anything and stop at nothing for power, which includes lying, cheating, stealing, and abusing any law that threatens to take power from them.\n\nThey will continue to cater to their lowest most vile supporters and continue to divide us until our country is a sham of what it used to be, with no unity or compromise in sight."
"Liberals denounce sexual predators even if it's one of their own.\n\nRepublicans deflect, excuse, defend, and elect theirs. \n\nYet Liberals are still somehow the bad ones? How come their standards are different?"
"Yeah yeah yeah, stop trying to deflect from Bill Clinton receiving a blowjob from a very horny and willing intern back in 1996, forcing morally outraged GOP house speaker Newt Gingrich to lead impeachment proceedings while cheating on his own wife with one of his own staff members. You sick sick sick perpetually offended 'murica-hating libruls and your nothing burgers."
"Can we please upvote the hell out of this post to call more attention to this story? \n\nTrump's elusion of these allegations during the campaign, as well as damning audio from the Access Hollywood tapes, have all been seemingly forgotten. If Roy Moore is being investigated all to hell and now even Al Franken is going to possibly undergo an ethics hearing, then why not Trump?\n\nShouldn't he have to answer for his crimes?"
"Maybe they were forgotten because they were lying. That's usually what happens when there's no proof.  "
"Among the other numerous claims, according to his ex-wife, he fucking raped her...he's such disgusting scum..."
"Sadly this is still being a viewed as a left/right issue. Sexual Assault and Predatory behavior  should be universally condemned because that's a person just like you, so why the fuck is it ok to treat them less than you? Hollywood/Franken are liberals or perceived to be that, that's why. "
'This. \n\nThe right want to distract the populace with a barely anything thing about Franken. I say hit them back with more and more stuff about trump. They need to start fighting fire with napalm'
"I love that we are now in a society where victims will willingly come forward much more often than 10 years ago.\n\nI hate that we are in a society where public guilt is determined immediately upon the accusation.\n\nI hate that, because of the second sentence, people can use an accusation to destroy someone's professional career.\n\nCase in point: Bernie Fine. Accused of sexual molestation. Fired by Syracuse. Professional coaching career destroyed. During the investigation, which included seizing several file cabinets, cell phone records, and other personal belongings, the four accusers admitted they fabricated the entire thing. Two of them were his step sons and two others were in prison, one for a sexual assault conviction. The investigation continued and no evidence was ever found. No charges were ever filed. But his career? Done. Forever."
'Where are the Frank accounts from this morning, who demanded Franken resign immediately? You believe allegations against Democratic politicians, but maintain that those against Republicans are lies and slander?'
"Kind of hijacking to offer this comment. \n\nYesterday NPR's *Morning Edition* did a segment on [politicians and sexual harassment.](https://www.npr.org/2017/11/15/564272316/cokie-roberts-on-politicians-and-sexual-harassment) It included this exchange between host Steve Inskeep and commentator Cokie Roberts in which they mentioned Strom Thurmond:\n\n> ROBERTS: Well, there's a huge shift in the rhetoric. It's everywhere in the last few weeks, as you all know. People are ready to call out the act of harassment, if not, necessarily the harasser himself. That's a big difference from years and years of just putting up with it.\n> \n> I mean, we all have stories of being chased around desk, of having hands on our knees at correspondent dinners. And then Strom Thurmond, Senator from South Carolina, was in the category of his own. He once kissed me on the mouth live on the air at a political convention.\n> \n> INSKEEP: And there was nothing for you to do about this, except.\n> \n> ROBERTS: No, no, we - there we were. 'Hi, Senator.'\n> \n> INSKEEP: OK. Now the other part of the question is, when were these incidents first discussed in public?\n> \n> ROBERTS: Well, of course, there's a difference between sexual encounters - which go back to Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson, which was made public in 1882, on up to powerful Congressman Wayne Hays hiring an unqualified woman as his mistress. \n\nWhat I find most troubling isn't Thurmond's behavior with Roberts. It isn't Roberts's glibness in describing the old days. It's that neither Roberts or Inskeep mentioned that at 22 Strom Thurmond impregnated Carrie 'Tunch' Butler, a 16 year old African-American woman who worked in his parents' house. \n\nI find it troubling that a discussion about politicians and sexual harassment that mentions Thurmond--and which mentions Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings-- would gloss over this important detail. Thurmond's and Butler's relationship may have been consensual. The age of consent might have been 16. But given the long, long history of white men sexually assaulting African-American women (a history that started during slavery and continued well into the 20th century) it seems like we should at least be sensitive to the possibility that Thurmond assaulted his parents' underage African-American servant. \n\nEDIT: word ist hard."
"Everyone knows Trump's a lowlife and very well could be a rapist. The problem is that that a good 35 to 40 percent of the country simply doesn't care. "
"Question: if a person is publicly accused of sexual misconduct as Trump has been, wouldn't he have a case for a defamation of character lawsuit? If so, wouldn't the fact that someone as litigious as Trump not pursuing that option speak volumes?\n\nHonest question"
'Code red, leftie pervert overload! \n\nQuick! Deflect deflect deflect! Whatabout whatabout whatabout! '
"A majority of the accusers during the 2016 election went dark when they were forced to proceed with it through court, because let's face it the amount of accusations against Trump and the ones that turned out to be completely false was ridiculous. So go to the court and start the process.. nobody is stopping you, but a president won't go down because of accusations without solid evidence.. remember that."
'This was bound to happen. Trump has been avoiding the Roy Moore situation because of the women that accused him. \n\nTrump knew if he came out against Moore, saying he believed the women, that people would say "So why shouldn\'t we believe the women that accused you?"'
"They weren't forgotten. They were deliberately buried and silenced, threatened with lawyers, NDAs, counter-suits.\n\n>“totally fake news. It’s just fake. It’s fake. It’s made-up stuff, and it’s disgraceful.” \n\n Perry Mason on defense. /s"
'Mitch Mcconell says that there is no excuse for sexual assault, and he has shown that he doesn’t lets partisanship get in the way (kind of, I don’t think he was Moore’s biggest fan) if he really believes that, then he should call out Trump for what he is.'

'[All Seth Abramson\'s tweets in this thread are interesting, too much to quote here. \n](https://twitter.com/SethAbramson/status/936602442996813824)\n> 1/ First, it\'s important to understand that Mueller has entered into a plea deal with Flynn in which Flynn pleads guilty to far less than the available evidence suggests he could be charged with. This indicates that he has cut a deal with Mueller to cooperate in the Russia probe.\n> \n> 2/ We\'ve already seen Mueller do this once before in the probe, with George Papadopoulos—who was charged with the same crime as Flynn, Making False Statements, to secure his cooperation with the Russia probe. The Papadopoulos plea affidavit emphasized facts were being left out.\n> \n> 6/ Deals like this are offered *only* when a witness can incriminate someone "higher up the food-chain" than them. In the case of the nation\'s former National Security Advisor, the *only* people above him in the executive-branch hierarchy are the President and the Vice President.\n> \n> 7/ There may be other targets in the Russia probe—such as Attorney General Sessions—at Flynn\'s same level in the hierarchy, but unless he could incriminate two or more of them, a deal like this would not be offered to him. And there *aren\'t* two or more at his level in this case.\n> \n> 8/ What this indicates—beyond any serious doubt—is the following: Special Counsel Bob Mueller, the former Director of the FBI, believes Mike Flynn\'s testimony will *incriminate* the President of the United States, the Vice President of the United States, or both of these two men.\n> \n> 9/ For this reason, what\'s about to happen in 50 minutes is far and away the biggest development thus far in the Trump-Russia probe, and likely the biggest development in U.S. politics since President Nixon resigned from office during the Watergate scandal. \n> \n> This is historic.\n> \n> 15/ Flynn met with the Russian ambassador and Jared Kushner in early December 2016 to discuss a "Kremlin back-channel" that some have argued would have constituted an act of espionage. Did Mr. Trump know about this? Did he direct Flynn and/or Kushner to pursue this back-channel?\n> \n> 17/ Indeed, today\'s plea coming so close on the heels of Mueller asking Kushner to come in and talk about Flynn suggests Kushner is also a target of the Russia probe. Perhaps Mueller didn\'t think Kushner would flip on family, so he set him up to Make False Statements about Flynn.\n> \n\n> 18/ This is critical: Flynn pleading guilty today means he was cooperating with Mueller *before* this. You don\'t offer value to a prosecution *after* you plead, you offer it beforehand—via what\'s called a "proffer" of info (that incriminates others). That\'s what earns you a deal.\n> \n> 19/ So it\'s entirely possible that when Mueller called Kushner in to talk about Flynn, he already had everything Flynn planned to give him—meaning he was *testing* Kushner to see if Kushner would lie about events Mueller was already fully informed about via Flynn\'s prior proffer.\n> \n> 20/ That proffer may have incriminated not just Trump and Kushner and—perhaps—Pence, but any number of Trump NatSec (or simply "top") aides: Manafort, Sessions, Clovis, Hicks, Lewandowski, Page, and Gordon, to name a few. We may not know, however, until someone else is indicted.\n\n> 26/ As I\'ve said, we now have reason to believe—to a near-certainty—Flynn can incriminate Trump. And as noted, the range of potential crimes is vast. Did Flynn tell Trump and/or Pence the truth about his Russia contacts as they were happening—despite what the White House claimed?\n> \n> 27/ Remember, besides a long course of conduct involving both Obstruction of Justice and Witness Tampering—of Sally Yates, of Comey, of Jr., of Flynn himself, of Sessions, and of various Congressional investigators—Trump is being looked at for Aiding and Abetting Computer Crimes.\n> \n> 28/ In the Aiding and Abetting Computer Crimes probe, the question is a) when Trump knew Russia was committing crimes against the United States, and b) whether and how Trump offered Russia anything of financial or political value ostensibly for "free" after he had this knowledge.\n> \n> 29/ If Donald Trump learned Russia was committing crimes against America and subsequently offered—unilaterally—policy shifts of political or financial value directly to Russian agents either himself or through intermediaries, he\'s guilty of a crime as great as the underlying one.\n> \n> 30/ We know Trump knew there was a "high likelihood" (the legal standard in this case) Russia was committing crimes against America as of August 17, 2016, when he received his first security briefing as a presidential candidate. A speech in late July suggests he knew it earlier.\n\n>31/ But given that Mike Flynn dined with Vladimir Putin in Moscow in December of 2015—after he\'d been a key Trump campaign foreign policy and national security advisor for four months—it\'s possible Trump had this knowledge as early as the fall of 2015 or the winter of 2015-2016.\n\n> 35/ Remember that Trump *not only* tried to get Comey to drop the case against Flynn—suggesting he was scared about what that case could uncover—he *also* tried to convince his aides to let him *re-hire* Flynn after his firing and *then* called Flynn to tell him to "stay strong."\n> \n> 36/ While Trump also exhibited some fear about what Manafort could reveal to investigators—keeping him on as an unpaid advisor through February 2017 after "firing" him as an unpaid Campaign Manager in the summer of 2016—he\'s shown much *more* concern about Mike Flynn\'s situation.\n\n> 38/ One thing is clear: Mueller charged Flynn with the most innocuous lies he could to shield from the public—and far more importantly, from President Trump and his allies (at least for now)—the extent of what Flynn has told him. A longer charging document would reveal too much.\n> \n> 39/ The first allegation in the single-count charging document is that Flynn lied about asking Russia to moderate its response to the US decision to level new sanctions in December 2016. Presumably, Flynn made this request on a representation Trump would undo those new sanctions.\n> \n> 40/ The second allegation, dating from 12/22/16—the first was from 12/29/16—involves Flynn asking Russia to take a particular stance on a UN resolution. While both these acts violate the Logan Act—private citizens can\'t negotiate with foreign governments—they\'re just appetizers.\n> \n> 41/ For Mueller to be *so guarded* in what information he\'s willing to reveal in his single-count indictment—as we know Mike Flynn lied to the FBI about far more serious things than Mueller has disclosed—confirms, indirectly, that Flynn\'s proffer to the FBI was *quite* explosive.\n\n>43/ But remember, when the FBI sat down to discuss Flynn\'s Russia contacts with him, they would have asked him about *all* his recent Russia contacts—including, for instance, his December \'15 trip to Moscow to dine with Putin. So the topics Flynn lied about could date back years.\n\nSeth Abramson\'s resumé: \n\n> 44/ (When I get a number of new readers—as today—people ask me to restate my bona fides: Harvard Law School, 2001; public defender for eight years in two jurisdictions; trained at Georgetown/Harvard as a criminal investigator; represented 2000+ defendants in cases up to homicide;\n> \n> 45/ have worked at 3 public defenders since 1996—one federal—and have testified in federal criminal cases as a defense investigator; current member in good standing of the New Hampshire bar and the federal bar for the District of New Hampshire; I now teach legal advocacy at UNH.)\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the gold :)'

A man who was charged with a crime and is now pleading guilty whereas Clinton never was found to do anything worth being charged.\n\nI hope this brings pause to anyone who wanted to come after Clinton for supposed crimes.  These are Trump's top people. Money launderers and foreign agents.  There is a lot more stink on Trump than there was ever on Clinton of illegality.  Where is your yearning for justice?"

'From [twitter](https://twitter.com/ZeddRebel/status/936602405256429568): Flynn (and his nazi-ass son) was looking at among other things: conspiracy, kidnapping, FARA charges, hiding foreign payments. One count of false statements is a sweeeeeeeeetheart deal.'

"Somewhere in a tacky, golden-decorated office, the President of the United States of America has been sent hurtling into a spittle-dribbling apoplectic rage, with junior staffers diving for his phone, desperate to keep him off Twitter for as long as possible.\n\nHis heart, burdened with plaque and cholesterol from fatty Trump steaks and greasy cheeseburgers, beats furiously but impotently crying out for relief and praying secretly for that one subtle lapse of timing that spells sweet release.\n\nHis brain, already scrambling desperately to cordon off those cells that still function at capacity from those withering away into dementia, hasn't the capacity to restrain him nor the willpower to try anymore.\n\nTonight, he will tweet. Manic, mindless, a Granny Weatherall stream of consciousness desperate to distract from the finger of Bob Mueller which has just pressed hard enough on the most significant domino to begin its tumble.\n\nHe will be up past midnight. He will pace around his empty bed, his so-called wife of course being absent from her duty to provide care and comfort as she always is. He will scream, spit flying into the face of helpless aides trying to make it one more day with a bottle and a resignation letter just one signature away.\n\nBehind other doors, lawyers are being called frantically. Lawyers and accountants. And family members they haven't seen voluntarily in years and soon involuntarily won't see for years more.\n\nThe devil makes deals, alright. And they always come due."
"Get fucked you piece of shit traitor. I wish they would send your ass to court martial and strip of you of all your honors, your commission, and demote you to being an E-1. \n\nI know everyone hates Michael Flynn for being a scumbag, but I'd just like to say I hate him a little bit more for being a traitorous son of a bitch that betrayed his nation **while he was in the fucking military**.

"One count of lying to the FBI about the December 29th conversation with Ambassador Kislyak when the sanctions were announced, and another instance of lying about another meeting in December.\n\nThis is exactly like George Papadapoulos.

The only fish bigger than him are Pence, Trump, Trump's family, and the Mercer/Bannon group.\n\nMike Flynn has connections to all of them."
'I wandered over to a certain sub, this has been my favorite take on the situation thus far.\n\n> Yep now he\'s going to jail for lying. I feel bad for the guy since he was unmasked illegally, but you can\'t lie to the FBI (unless your Hillary ofc).\n> In my opinion I think him pleading guilty and it not being a secret shows that he isn\'t going to flip on anyone. So far we have 0 collusion and 0 link to Trump. Just a witch hunt that caught some guys in a panic and they lied in the panic.\n> EDIT: I also think Flynn would make a terrible witness, he is a proven liar, you can\'t charge someone with lying and then also want them to sing your song. The defense would argue that Flynn would lie about anyone to get out of this.\n\nI do like like the juxtaposition of "nothing to see here" mixed in with "he\'s not going to flip". How could he "flip" if there\'s nothing to "flip" about?\n'

People go to prison all the time for stealing items of negligible value or falling afoul of regional drug laws.

They move to an area until every resource is consumed and the only way they can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern.

'Why it\'s alarming and can\'t be dismissed as "just a joke":  \n\n* **The potential "joke" just doesn\'t work**, on top of being in very bad taste. It doesn\'t matter who says it, if it\'s Trump or Lincoln: being the President forever isn\'t something the President should desire, even jokingly. It could work as a joke if the overall promise was "oh that\'d be nice, but of course wrong on many levels so it won\'t happen". There isn\'t anything nice about it in this case, unless Trump is insinuating that he\'d really enjoy governing forever, which again makes it very alarming.\n* **The situation in China is very serious**, and no joking matter to begin with. This isn\'t the way to talk about what\'s essentially a dictatorship now, Xi\'s actions should be condemned, not praised or joked about.\n* **Trump is under investigation for collusion** already, and has shown authoritarian ideas and policies. We have reasons to believe he\'d actually be fine with something similar to what\'s going on in China atm.\n\nThis is a disaster, plain and simple. America, you\'d better hope the Mueller investigation is successful, because otherwise, Trump WILL definitely become a dictator in time. It *can* happen to the US, and it is happening right now. Like any birthing dictatorship, it\'s just not happening in a bombastic and sudden way, instead slowly but surely taking over. It starts with small enough stuff, which do still lead to complaints, but nothing big enough for people to panic. And with time, everyone gets used to it, scandals become the norm, and bigger, more dangerous changes can start to occur. They would\'ve caused an outrage if they happened immediately, but now that the whole country is "sedated" by all the smaller ones, they don\'t seem that bad, and people are willing to overlook them.\n\nAmerica is past that already, now we\'re getting to the crazy stuff already. And sadly I kind of expect this horrifying remark to be forgotten about in a week or so. **Now the President can get away with saying he\'d want the United States of freaking America to be more like a dictatorship**, wrap your head around that.'

Talking to Russia isn\'t a crime. Flynn contacting Russia during the transition was his job, and now they want to hang him for it?"\n\n- Justifying: "Flynn was trying to deescalate the situation with Russia to prevent World War III" (actual quote) and/or "everyone lies in Washington, this isn\'t that big of a deal."\n\n- Blaming Mueller: "They got him on a bullshit technicality, this is ridiculous--this investigation needs to end" and "using a technicality to pressure Flynn into testifying against others in the administration--dirty tricks"\n\n- Blaming Clinton: "Hilllary lied to the FBI and she wasn\'t charged, and now they want to charge Flynn for doing the same thing!?"\n\nBe ready to refute these, people!

The effort involved a group of former European politicians known as the Hapsburg Group.**\n\n>**Manafort called the PR man, identified only as D1, while that man was a passenger in a car driven by his own wife in Italy, the prosecutor said.**\n\n>**"This is Paul, Paul Manafort. I need to give you a heads up about the Hapsburg Group," Manafort said, according to the prosecutor.**\n\n>**D1 immediately hung up, the prosecutor said.**\n\n>**Mueller\'s team has said that two days later, Manafort sent D1 an encrypted message containing an article related to the Hapsburg Group, adding in the note: "We should talk. I have made it clear that they worked in Europe."**\n\n>**D1 has told Mueller\'s investigators that he believed Manafort was trying to get him to falsely state that the Hapsburg Group had limited its lobbying efforts to Europe. In fact, the group had also sought to influence opinion in the United States, without registering as required.**\n\n>However, Manafort\'s lawyer scoffed at the idea that he was trying to tamper a witness.\n\n>Berman has yet to rule on the request to revoke Manafort\'s bail, which would lead to him being jailed before his trials, or to modify the terms of his release.\n\n>Manafort, a long-time Republican lobbyist and political consultant, has been under house arrest since he was originally indicted last fall on charges related to his consulting work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. Prosecutors accuse Manafort of reaching out to a pair of people who could testify at one of his two upcoming trials in an effort to have their version of events about his work align with his claims.\n\n>The first trial is scheduled to start in late July in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va. The second, in Washington federal court, is scheduled for September.\n\n>Kilimnik, who is suspected of connections to Russian intelligence services, was a longtime employee of Manafort\'s political consulting groups, and did work for him in Ukraine. He had not been charged before the indictment released June 8 accusing him and Manafort of witness tampering.\n\n>President Donald Trump, while speaking to reporters outside the White House on Friday morning, was asked about Manafort.\n\n>"Manafort has nothing to do with our campaign," Trump said. "I feel a little badly about it."\n\n>"You know, Paul Manafort worked for me for a very short period of time. He worked for Ronald Reagan. He worked for Bob Dole. He worked for many other he worked for me, what, 49 days or something. Very short period of time."\n\n>In fact, Manafort served 144 days as Trump\'s presidential campaign chairman.

"#***A partial overview of Paul Manafort's past ~~crimes~~ career:***\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n***Washington, DC:***\n\n\n- **1976**: Delegate hunter for the President Ford Committee\n\n- **1978 - 1980**: Southern coordinator for Reagan's presidential campaign (and running-mate George H. W. Bush), deputy political director of RNC.\n\n- **1980**: Formed political lobbying firm Black, Manafort, [Roger] Stone, and Kelly; which was employed by Reagan's election campaign.\n\n- **1980 - 1981**: Personnel coordinator, Office of Executive Management, during the Reagan administration's transition period.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n\n***Black, Manafort, Stone, and Kelly:***\n\n\nThe lobbying firm created by Paul Manafort and Roger Stone used connections within the US government to generate military, political, and economic support for brutal dictators all over the world. In the mid-2000s, Transparency International released a list of the world's top kleptocrats - [three of the top four corrupt leaders were Manafort clients:](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/26/indonesia.philippines)\n\n\n> - Suharto (Indonesia, $15-35 billion)\n- Ferdinand Marcos (The Philippines, $5-10 billion) – **Manafort client**\n- Mobutu Sese Seko (Zaire, $5 billion) – **Manafort client**\n- Sani Abacha (Nigeria, $2-5 billion) – **Manafort client**\n\n\nManafort (and Roger Stone) have made their fortunes from this dirty money:\n\n>The well-connected Washington lobbying firm of Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly has seen dictators such as Somalia's Mohamed Siad Barre, the Philippines' late Ferdinand Marcos and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire vanish from its client list. **So Black, Manafort knows the value of a steadfast tyrant. In the case of Jonas Savimbi, the controversial Angolan rebel leader, it's $600,000 a year - plus expenses.**\n\n>Trouble is, between 1985 and 1992, Black, Manafort's cash cow may have indirectly been the U.S. Treasury.\n\n>**Up until 1992, Savimbi, whose UNITA guerrilla forces long battled the Soviet-allied Angolan government, received up to $60 million a year in U.S. aid.** Much of it took the form of guns, ammunition and other military supplies shipped by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) via Zaire (whose longtime military dictator, Mobutu, was a $1 million-per-year Black, Manafort client until December 1990).\n\n>**With most of his war supplies provided by the U.S., Savimbi was able to pay Black, Manafort some $5 million to lobby for U.S. aid, generate favorable U.S. media coverage and gin up political support in Washington.** With Black, Manafort's help, Savimbi has made at least five well-publicized trips to Washington, visiting President Reagan at the Oval Office, dining with former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and meeting with then-Vice President George Bush in 1988.

His regime was famous for its corruption and extreme brutality, and supported by the US government. In 1986 Marcos fled the Philippines with his stolen wealth and was granted asylum by the US government, where he lived the rest of his life in exile.\n\n\n- **Mobutu Sese Soko** - Military dictator of DRC / Zaire from 1965-1997. Seized power through military coup d'etat. *The* classic African dictator - deeply criminal but willing to be a US ally, Mobutu destroyed his country through nepotism and embezzlement. In 1997 Mobutu fled Zaire and lived the rest of his life in exile.\n\n\n- **Sani Abacha** - De facto President of Nigeria from 1993-1998. Seized power through military coup d'etat, for the ~5 years he and his family were in power they stole $5+ billion from the government.\n\n\n- **Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo** - President of Equatorial Guinea 1979-present. Seized power through military coup d'etat, currently the second longest-serving non-royal leader in the world. His government is effectively a legal dictatorship, and has been marked by corruption.\n\n\n- **Siad Barre** - President of Somalia 1969-1991. Seized power through coup d'etat. Regime characterized by widespread human rights abuses and authoritarian rule. In 1991 Barre fled Somalia and lived the rest of his life in exile.\n\n\n- **Viktor Yanukovych** - President of Ukraine 2010-2014.

They were there to assemble a fast-attack submarine purchased from France. The bombing was initially blamed on al Qaeda, but was later discovered to be financially motivated: the 1994 sale of French submarines to Pakistan had involved massive amounts of bribery, kickbacks, and illicit payments to both Pakistani and French middlemen. A confidential report by France's intelligence service found that a discontinuation of payments was the reason for the attack.

"I had to Google exactly where Manafort is jailed.  He's being held at the Northern Neck Regional Jail, about 45 miles from D.C.  It's in Warsaw, VA, in Richmond County which is two hours from Richmond the city.  It's in the first congressional district so the rep is Rob Wittman, a pro Trump Repub.  As jails go this place has to be gravy.  It's one of the lowest crime areas of the state and the industries are fishing and agriculture.  It's interesting to me that the jails service area is NOT D.C. or Northern VA.  Someone pulled some strings so he doesn't have to be in jail with actual criminals.  Inmate population is only 460 and the place was expanded and remodeled in 2000.  Paul Manafort was booked into the jail at 8:22 p.m. on 6/15/2018.   Edited to point out under his location in the jail his status is listed as : VIP  http://www.nnrj.state.va.us/XJailWebSite/CurrentInmates.aspx"
'He will die in prison'
"Some intersting points made by Mitchell Epner, a former Assistant US Attorney, on the practical implications of Manfort getting his bail revoked:\n\n1. Manafort will spend tonight in jail, behind real bars, and the foreseeable future until his trial date. Appeals court rarely overturn discretionary bail ruling made by district judges.\n\n2. He will be held in pre-trial lockup, which has very little sorting of detainees. This means he will be jailed alongside real accused criminals headed to either Max or medium security prison.\n\n3. The fastest way to get out of pre-trial general population is to Flip. \n\n4. Being jailed before trial is a huge roadblock to being able to prepare your defense. You can't work around the clock alongside experts sorting through your backlog of documents only you know about anymore. You can only do work during visiting hours with the materials that the attorneys can carry in.\n"

"You know you've fucked up when a CIA director has the moral high ground against you."
'I can’t escape thoughts about what happens after the fall.  What should yield a massive pendulum swing to the left will become some soft, bullshit settling for prior levels of conservatism due to the feeling of “at least we’re beyond Trump and back to politics as usual.”\n\nFuck that.  The only way to fix this shit AND prevent it from happening again is progressive reign for at least 10-20 years.  Then *maybe* some asshole ideology can seep back in like sewage.\n\nYes, I appreciate condemnation of Trumpism from “traditional” conservatives.  We can’t get lost in overpraise of what should be the minimum standard.  We’ve been saying step by step how this is an evil, repugnant cloud yet these people stayed on the sidelines, didn’t think it would be this bad, or, worse, supported this shitshow.  Why should they have a voice in how the country recovers and functions in the aftermath?  I’m not talking about silencing.  I’m talking about elementary skepticism along the lines of “hey, remember when you supported that asshole a couple weeks ago?  And remember when you supported that other asshole that ruined the country before this asshole?”  Conservatism lends itself to fucking up the entire country because there are absolutely no guiding principles beyond “don’t pay for that.”'

That organization is loaded up with right-wing Republican leadership and has been for decades now. At the end of the day, when you lay with dogs, don't be surprised when you get fleas.

He really is out of control beyond anything we've seen.  Swalwell and Brennan know the secrets behind Trump's crimes. \n\nAnd I still can't believe Republicans and the MAGA cult don't see a single issue with his behavior. "

'Call me crazy but this is a hell of a coincidence.  Remember Trump saying, ["Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing"](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html)?  That was July 27, 2016.\n\nNow look at this line on pages 7-8 of the indictment:\n\n> For example, on or about **July 27, 2016**, the Conspirators attempted after hours to spearphish **for the first time** email accounts at a domain hosted by a third-party provider and used by Clinton\'s personal office.  At or around the same time, they also targeted seventy-six email addresses at the domain for the Clinton Campaign.\n\n*edit: belated typo fix*'
'Here\'s a buried lede in the indictments:  \n  \n[Link](https://twitter.com/peterjhasson/status/1017805935400706052):  \n  \n>On or about August 15, 2016, the Conspirators, posing as Guccifer 2.0, received a request for stolen documents from a candidate for the US Congress. The Conspirators responded using the Guccifer 2.0 persona and sent the candidate stolen documents related to the candidate\'s opponent.  \n  \nThere\'s your fucking collusion.  \n  \nedit: My guess is [Matt Gaetz](https://mobile.twitter.com/RVAwonk/status/1017539605132906497), the most vocal in calling for Trump to fire Mueller. Gaetz is also buddy-buddy with Roger Stone.  \n  \nedit 2: Appears Ron DeSantis used some as well, see comment from user aafarensis with the link. Also, [this WSJ story from 2017:](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-alleged-russian-hacker-teamed-up-with-florida-gop-operative-1495724787) "How Alleged Russian Hacker Teamed Up With Florida GOP Operative"  \n  \n>The hacking spree that upended the presidential election wasn’t limited to Democratic National Committee memos and Clinton-aide emails posted on websites. The hacker also privately sent Democratic voter-turnout analyses to a Republican political operative in Florida named Aaron Nevins.  \n  \nSo connecting dots here: Guccifer (Russians) hack DCCC/DNC info in Florida. Roger Stone acts as POC for Guccifer, and has them give the info to Nevins. Nevins then distributes the hacked documents to DeSantis and Gaetz. My guess is that Gaetz is the one mentioned in the indictment given it says "candidate" not "incumbent" or "sitting Congressman".'
"Few quick notes : \n\n[Here's the actual indictment](https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download)\n\n\n* Guccifer 2.0/DCleaks (which Roger Stone and Wikileaks were in communication with. )\n\n* It confirms the effort (and those aliases) were directly tied to GRU and the Russian government.\n\n* The indictments mention Wikileaks as an unnamed group(not yet indicted) used for timing and distribution of the hacked information for maximum effect \n\n* The indictments mention communications with Stone as an unnamed person (not yet indicted) whom provided extensive feedback on the hacked materials. \n\n* The indictments mention distribution of hacked material to an unnamed state lobbyist/online source of political news (not sure who this is yet, might be [this guy](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-alleged-russian-hacker-teamed-up-with-florida-gop-operative-1495724787), but I'm not sure)\n\n* The indictment mentions an unnamed Congressional candidate who had sought and received material. (not sure who this is yet)  [People seem to think this is Brian Mast,](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/gop-operative-russian-hacker-gave-him-2016-voter-data) we'll see if that gets confirmed. Nevins may have assisted all Florida GOP members, its possible someone outside of Florida directly asked themselves. \n\n\n* The indictment mentions GRU working with journalist looking for dirt on Black Lives Matter. (Someone from Breitbart?, Fox? some obvious suspects there) This appears to be Breitbart/Sputnik journalist Lee Stranahan. \n\n\n\n* **The indictment mentions targeted attacks on July 27, 2016 directed at the Clinton campaign and Clinton's personal office. What else happened that day? [Trump publicly asked Russia to hack Clinton](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/trump-putin-no-relationship-226282) .** Fun coincidence huh? \n\n* The indictment, much like the last one of the Russians doesn't try to assess whether or not they had an impact on the election results. It is a specific, isolated slice as it has been every time. \n\n\n* This now means Mueller has charged 32 people 3 companies and has gotten 5 guilty pleas in a little over a year. Involving both Trump officials (whom were all charged with crimes in one way or another related to Russia) or people tied to the Russian government. \n\nThis witch hunt is finding an awful lot of witches.\n\nThis comes off the back of a joke of a hearing yesterday where the House GOP attacked and tried to discredit one of the lead FBI agents on the FBI investigation into this and also Trump meets with Putin in a few days. Quite the contrast.\n\n\nI'll edit this if I think of anything else of note/see anyone else notice anything. And if people have questions, feel free to ask. \n"

This is huge.\n\n"Russia, if you\'re listening..."\n\nApparently, they very much were.\n\nEDIT: Wikileaks also clearly involved as a puppet of the GRU, although Rosenstein is not identifying them by name - merely refers to "another group" that was funnelled DNC documents to be released to the public.\n\nEDIT: Just so there\'s no misunderstanding: the GRU is an official intelligence organ of the Russian government. This was a state-sponsored attack on the electoral system of the United States. The timing of this - two days before Trump has a private meeting with Putin - cannot be an accident. Were I a total conspiracy theorist, I would wonder if the DoJ is setting a trap for their own President...\n\nEDIT: Trump was informed earlier in the week and is fully aware of the indictments being made today despite being overseas.\n\nEDIT: In Q&A, Rosenstein makes it clear that the timing of these indictments relative to Trump\'s meeting with Putin is coincidental. Conspiracy theorists, stand down :)\n\nEDIT: In Q&A, Rosenstein declines to speculate as to whether GRU attempts to influence the election were actually _successful_ - these indictments merely allege that they _attempted_ it.\n\nEDIT: In Q&A, Rosenstein elegantly side-steps a question as to whether Trump approved of the indictments :) \n\n"I\'ll let the President speak for himself" lol\n\nLet me guess, it\'s still a witch-hunt, amirite? :)\n\nEDIT: Oh my god, he actually did call it a witch-hunt again. Earlier today at Chequers (remember, he knew about these indictments in advance). Unbelievable.\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/hours-after-bashing-british-leader-may-trump-praises-her-n891131\n\n> He also said the investigation into his 2016 campaign\'s ties to Russia is harmful to the U.S., particularly as he aims to form a better relationship with President Vladimir Putin when the two meet in Helsinki Monday.\n\n> "I think that we\'re being hurt very badly by the — I would call it \'the witch hunt.\' I would call it \'the rigged witch hunt,\'" he said of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\'s probe. "I think that really hurts our country and it really hurts our relationship with Russia. I think that we would have a chance to have a very good relationship with Russia."\n\n> Trump said "yes" when asked whether he would tell Putin not to meddle in American elections ...'
'Rosenstein: "I briefed President Trump earlier this week."\n\nTrump this AM: "The DOJ investigation is a witchhunt!"\n\nRosenstein: "The Russians are attacking us."\n\nTrump: "The DOJ is attacking us!" '

"Someday when this is a film, this scene will be intercut with Trump sitting down to tea with the Queen.

'Please humor me in engaging in a tactic called *reflection*. We know there are Russian agents on here, usually low level Russians needing cash (what with the economic depression and sanctions, Russia isn\'t doing so hot), so here\'s how you get through to them:\n\nWhenever you suspect they may be from Russia, insert some information that Russian citizens don\'t normally see. Use it as a backdoor *back into* Russia. Eventually the higher-ups won\'t like what their workers see. Eventually, it might start swaying Russians.\n\nRemember, don\'t take fault in the Russian citizens—I personally admire them and their stoicism—strictly recognize the state actors who manipulate them. \n\nSo with that, let\'s talk about Russia, the Oligarchy, and Putin:\n\nIt really is par for the course for Putin.

'We should be worried about this threat to our entire democracy. Instead, we are arguing amongst each other and playing right into their hands. This is pathetic. Look at what Rosenstein said,\n\n“When we confront foreign interference in American elections, it is important for us to avoid thinking politically as Republicans or Democrats and instead to think patriotically as Americans. Our response must not depend on who was victimized,” he said. “There will always be adversaries who work to exacerbate domestic differences and try to confuse, divide, and conquer us. So long as we are united in our commitment to the values enshrined in the Constitution, they will not succeed.”\n\nAllowing ourselves to further this schism in our country is foolish.'

"They're going a different route for now.\n\nDiscredit the special counsel.  Discredit the FBI.  So that they can both try to rip the FBI to shreds AND ignore the results of the investigation. It's seriously fucked up."
"Here's the other thing: \n\nIf he fires Mueller and they don't impeach him, Republicans will have essentially told him that no actions are off limits.  \n\nI would expect his behavior to worsen thereafter."
'who the hell do you mean by "We".  Republicans will **never** impeach Trump.'

Impeach this moron already!"
'We have always known we would get to this moment, when Trump was being cornered and he’d fire Mueller. There was a time when the GOP was saying that was a line we couldn’t cross, and now they’ve been waging a PR war against him to make it plausible that they can not act when Trump does this.\n\n\nI’ll say this, if he does fire Mueller, the people must demand accountability'
"Where is this idea coming from that he's going to fire him? The man who put Mueller in charge said he has no intention of it, and I haven't heard Trump say he intends to.\n\nIs this just the usual reddit bitch fit?"

Once that is done, they should spend the rest of their lives on the receiving end of a firing squad. '

'I don\'t think it makes sense to say "if Trump crosses X line" we impeach. There is no moral line he will not cross to glorify himself.\n\n\nLook at the lines he has already crossed: \n\n\n1. Obstructed justice by asking Comey to "let go" of Flynn investigation.\n2. Fired Comey thinking it would end the total investigation.\n3. Held private meeting with Russians, where American media was banned, but Russian media allowed. Spoon fed top secret classified information to Russians at this meeting.\n4. .... any many more things.\n\nWe must impeach now. The rules governing a special counsel puts Mueller FAR, FAR outside Trump\'s reach in firing.  If Trump could, he would have fired him by now. \n'
'> If Trump fires Mueller, as many now speculate is possible, the United States will find itself in a constitutional crisis—where the executive branch rejects scrutiny, checks and balances, and the rule of law in order to protect itself from accountability. \n\nI agree with what they’re saying, and thought it can get much worse, the crisis has been here since the beginning of Trumps presidency. \n\nTrump has rejected EVERY SINGLE piece of scrutiny that was thrown his way. In Trumps mind,he’s done literally nothing wrong and everything right. He’s waged a war on the press, he’s attacked courts, judges, intelligence agencies and our entire system of checks and balances. He’s threatened and attempted to obstruct the methods of checks and balances. Trump doesn’t understand what any of those things are for, and since Trump can do no wrong in his mind, they’re a bunch of biased, time and money wasters, out to get him. Unfortunately many of his millions of supporters also don’t understand how these things, like checks and balances, are supposed to work, why they’re in place, .etc look to Trump to form their opinions and world views. \n\nSo yes, it’s already crisis. Trump could rally support for the most insane, illegal actions if he wanted. It doesn’t help that they’re also short-sighted and aren’t thinking about precedent. Trump isn’t going to be the last president we ever have (unless we get nuked to nothing), so what about the next time a (D) president they despise comes around. If they start pulling the same shit, these republicans better realize it’s on them. But I know they won’t. '
'https://twitter.com/maddow/status/941812414487478273\n\nSome people are hypothesizing this will be the downfall of Rosenstein, which means Mueller could be in jeopardy. A lot of what-if\'s... But consider the news from the last 24 hours. \n\nGowdy saying McCabe won\'t be around next week, Trump saying they are going to "rebuild" the FBI, increased rhetoric from right wing media (esp. Fox) amping up support for Mueller firing, some unsubstantiated rumors of a Kushner indictment (plus his hiring of a crisis management firm), & the revelation that Cambridge Analytica turned over documents to Mueller months ago.'

"Go ahead and impeach Trump, its not going to end the way you think it will.  I know you truly believe that it was just a few hundred people in clan uniforms that got him elected but that mentality doesnt serve you well at all.  \n\nTrump voters fall into a bunch of different categories but there are two that you need to pay attention to.  There are people that were jobless for a year or more under Obama/ Bush, or they are stuck getting paid half of what they did before and they like Trumps job message, that's where you lost WI and MI.  And then there are people who are traditionally conservative but they HATE the GOP, to them it doesn't matter if Trump succeeds, Trump is a hand grenade in a cancerous system.\n\nSo what happens when you nuke Trump via witch hunts?

It's not like the White House press briefings are worth a fuck with SHS getting out and telling verifiable lie after verifiable lie, then yelling at the press for pointing out all she does is lie.  Then the GOP will be in a tight spot, and when they side with the President, as they always do, we will bludgeon them with that for decades to come.  Sure, some will forget, but many will start to see the Truth, the GOP is not a political party, it's a cancer that's actively seeking to destroy the Republic.  "

Newspapers, radio, film, music and all forms of media were put under the control of the Nazis. Even telling jokes about Hitler was a major offence that could sentence a person to the concentration camps and potentially death.

'>Gates, 45, who is married with four children, does not appear to be well positioned financially to sustain a high-powered legal defense.\n\n>"He can\'t afford to pay it,\'\' said one lawyer who is involved with the investigation. "If you go to trial on this, that\'s $1 million to $1.5 million. Maybe more, if you need experts\'\' to appear as witnesses.\n\n\nSo does this mean he doesn\'t have the resources outside of the illegal money they\'ve made or he was just a shitty saver? Manafort was ballin and these two were partners.'
'This explains why more charges were brought against Manafucked on Friday. This is why Trump is freaking out on Twitter. This is how Mueller brought down Enron. This week is going to require more popcorn.'
'What we know from reports about the indictments of Manafort and Gates last year is that there was a lot of evidence against them. And Manafort fucked himself over once again with that op-ed bullshit then special counsel discovered the bank fraud.\n\nGates is not getting a deal to snitch on Manafort for financial crimes *only*. He would have to offer more.\n\nAnd Manafort is officially obliterated. Just vaporized. The only way his family doesn’t lose EVERYTHING is to spill some major fucking beans.\n\nAnd Gates was there for all of it, so Manafort may not even be needed. He’s gonna have to really fucking deliver \n\nThis is terrible for the WH'
"Manafort was the campaign manager until August 2016. He was around for the Trump Tower meeting June 9th, the DNC email leak, etc. He knows where the bodies are buried.\n\nPosted this in another thread, but when you read between the lines of Friday's indictments, they're a lot more damning than they first appear. I think this Internet Research Agency is somehow connected to Guccifer 2.0. In addition to being a general troll farm, they either know or are linked to the individuals that hacked the DNC and Podesta emails. Roger Stone (a longtime friend of Manafort) claimed to know Guccifer 2.0 and more than likely was aware that either he or someone on the Trump campaign interacted with the IRA and used the services of Ricky Pinedo to pay them off. Pinedo was a middleman kept in the dark about the larger picture, so that's why Rosenstein accurately stated no Americans wittingly cooperated in this indictment. When were the bank accounts set up? Two days after it was reported the DNC was hacked and a day before Wikileaks released them. Mueller is setting the stage, even though it's not explicit just yet. That's why Trump is fucking unhinged right now - he knows he's cooked, it's just a matter of time."
'News of two more guilty pleas (Pinedo and Gates) and the russian indictments explains the temper tantrum Trump had this morning.'
"Like others, I'm skeptical that this is going to turn into Manafort flipping; I'm not sure that Mueller would even make a proffer. Unless Manafort knows some crazy shit that even Mueller hasn't unearthed, he's a legitimate final (not exclusive) target of the investigation. Manafort isn't a guy who made a few bad decisions or took zealous partisanship beyond the limits of the law. He's a scheming, evil man who deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison. And unless Mueller really, truly *needs* him to nail Trump, he will."
'So how will republicans react now that Mueller strategy is to take down and expose the entire Trump campaign criminal syndicate. So they expect Americans to believe everyone on the Trump campaign(who will eventually be charged with all kinds of crimes) is guilty and Trump is not? Could Trump, as a citizen, even pass the test for security clearance?\n\n\nWe need wide spread constitutional reform for the “office” of the presidency and cut the power on the individual elected. Congress only works if they are not corrupted. There has to be enforced laws. '
'I just worry, who is going to get bombed to distract the media as the noose tightens?'

I mean, we would have fired them if it was beyond a reasonable doubt, but having them on film made it a slam dunk to go after recouping our losses and justified the paid man hours it would take to do so in many cases... all because they didn't take two steps to the left before sliding the item/cash into their pocket.\n\nI don't know if it's laziness, hubris or something else entirely, but this has been the unextinguishable light of hope that I've held onto through all of this: *the wide majority of these criminals will not step to the left.

'This is the most disgusting and vile thing he has said about us to date.\n\nI\'m here in Puerto Rico and I can confirm that what Trump just accused us of is a straight up lie so as to portray us a leeches on the US Fed. Government. This is a game that has been played out many times in the past few years so as to give Puerto Ricans a bad name in the mainland; a prominent example being the ads that were aired before the PROMESA Bill was passed that said we just wanted free money and we\'re a strain on the US economy. \n\nI know of hundred of relief efforts by our diaspora in both mainland US and even Europe, trying to organize food, medicine, and all types of aid for us from afar. Care packages being sent over, community efforts to bring in money and aid as soon as possible. I know of dozens of local community efforts to provide food to the hungry, organized solely on what money and resources we have left...and I would know of more if our communication infrastructure wasn\'t so devastated. I know of dozens of community brigades being organized and executed to clear up roads, take care of the abandoned elderly who were literally sleeping in their own feces, and to rescue people trapped in their homes. I know of volunteer workers and truck drivers that have showed up to the government\'s and FEMA\'s headquarters in the convention center who have been turned away because of some fucking stupid bureaucracy that won\'t put them to good use unless they are listed and then called back to help, when these same volunteers don\'t have signal in their homes and wasted what little gasoline they have left to get there. I know of hundreds of local businesses that have been doing everything possible to organize and continue operating and producing against all odds. We\'ve been carpooling to work since Monday, using our bosses personal generator and huddling up our office and warehouse team in a consolidated space. We, the people of Puerto Rico, are doing everything we can with a devastated infrastructure and help that took too long to get here. Trump was too busy golfing and tweeting about NFL players to notice us until 5 days after the hurricane hit.\n\nBut to play this "leeches" game now, when lives are at stake, where hundreds have died post-hurricane because of their life support and necessary medicines being cut off because of generators losing power... it\'s just too much to read. We are owed this help as any US citizen deserves. Thousands of our people have died in US wars, our territory of Vieques had been used for over 60 years in bombing experiments with radioactive materials and lead, our citizens were used in covert contraceptive experiments in the 40s, without our knowledge, that lead to a revolution in the industry, Dr. Cornelius Rhodes tried and wanted to exterminate our people by infecting us with cancer and moved on to be a celebrated military doctor. Our economy has served as a tax heaven for US companies that have left when loopholes where taken away and tanked our economy, our agriculture was forcefully turned into a monoculture of sugar and when corn-syrup arrived we lost almost the entire industry, being forced to ship in 80% of our food at almost double the cost of any state because of the Jones Act...and we were just now reviving this industry as part of an effort to revive our economy with local industry when Hurricane Maria came to take it all away. We contribute in tax dollars, in human capital and in natural resources to the US, and he dares call us leeches on the system that we have no choice but to be part of....I don\'t have enough curse words for the massive turd he is laying on a people ravaged by a natural disaster exacerbated by climate change, which he also fucking denies. What a piece of shit. We deserve better.\n\nEdit: I found this article yesterday that perfectly summed up what has happened in Puerto Rico to date, check it out if you\'re interested in more information: http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/how-puerto-rico-is-becoming-trumps-katrina-w505523'

"Fuck Trump. \n\nI've never despised a politician this much before. I didn't vote for him, but I gave that guy the benefit of the doubt that he would at least try to uphold the values of the presidency.

"Texas and Florida: we need aid, that Hurricane was bad\n\nTrump: it will be there right away. \n\nPuerto Rico: we need aid to, that hurricane was really bad. \n\nTrump: wait, there's a big ocean, and the people there want everything done for them, I guess I could lift the Jones act for 10 days. \n\nPuerto Rico: we are dying here, do you not care about your citizens?\n\nTrump: did the democrats tell you to say that? Because I bet they told you to say that. \n\nPuerto Rico: wait...what?\n\n*trump goes golfing*\n\nA rundown of the past month in hurricane news."
'There are certain public figures that no politician, on either side of the aisle, in their right mind would dare criticize: Those being, leaders in the midst of a humanitarian crisis.\n\n\nTrump has now criticized both Carmen Yulín Cruz and Sadiq Khan. There is literally no low he will not stoop to.\n\n\nFuck you, you piece of shit.'
'Everyone is talking about how this just continues to lower the floor for the Presidency.\n\nNope.\n\nThis is awful by general human standards. He is an objectively awful person, not just President.'
'This should be a notice to all you PRs and Cubans in florida who voted Trump (and there were a lot of them)  you fucked up, big time. '
'I voted for Trump as a lifelong republican and it was a huge mistake. I’ve never been so disgusted by someone in my life. I’ll be voting Democrat across the board now just to get this POS out of office'
'Of all the things Trump has done, this is perhaps the most disgusting. Saving American citizens from a humanitarian crisis, supporting desperate and frustrated people is an even easier political win than denouncing Nazis. And he refuses to do it.'
"I'm Puerto Rican but I grew up in the continental US. I grew up hearing all the time that Puerto Rican's are lazy and that we want hand outs. I bet you guys can imagine my shock, anger, and frustration when I woke up this morning to hear the President of our country using these stereotypes that historically have been used to discriminate against us. This is like Lyndon B Johnson telling African Americans to stop complaining about civil rights during the civil rights movement. "
"Yeah, this is what happens when you criticize the baby and dispute his narrative that everything, everywhere is going 'great'. Just like his shitty hotels, casinos, steaks, water, wine, etc., Trump thinks he can make his administration 'great' simply by insisting upon on it. He's legitimately fucking insane. \n\nThe only saving grace is that he incredibly lazy, ignorant, and incompetent, so many of his malignant aspirations have fallen flat on their face. However, in a crisis in which you actually require executive competence (e.g. hurricane response), that same lack of ability can have dire consequences. "
"It's weird how he calls the brown Spanish speaking people lazy and essentially asking for a government handout. It's almost as if he's really ignorant and racist."
"I lived in Puerto Rico most of my life. The first thing that happens after a hurricane is that people go out with machetes, to clear up the roads and help each other's with respect to food , doing repairs to each others houses and rescue people. I am not there right now but, I am pretty sure this is what is going on , so there is a community effort going on, not a ton of lazy people waiting for rescue efforts to fix their Netflix and Facebook. \n\nThe US is helping out, however the San Juan mayor is stressing out how bad the situation is down in the trench lines and that the red tape needs to be cut and supplies need to be delivered.  It is worth noting that the San Juan mayor  might still be living out of a shelter with 300(?) fellow citizens.  Having a ton of people depending on you to be their voice to clamor for help has to be a very difficult situation.\n\nAlso note a lot of the people suffering the most right there are poor, people who didn't have the money to have a generator, a strong house and a month worth of canned food and water. People who can not afford a plane ticket to flee the island. People whose houses were destroyed or flooded because they couldn't afford anything else.\n\n\nI have been in contact with my family there, and this is a summary of the situation:\n* response from the federal government is appropriate so far according to the governor of Puerto Rico (he had a press conference an hour ago)\n* the major of the capital says the process is highly inefficient and they are not getting the resources in need\n* other majors from the island are screaming for food and water, as no help has gotten their way\n* citizens need to make lines of up to 10 hours to fill in your car with gas or get gas to run a generator. \n* there are places where people are drinking out of water streams\n* hospital capacity is limited, they are working with \n generators, many employees are living out of the hospital since their house was destroyed. These generators are for emergency and they may fail\n* people who have medical conditions may lack medicine, there are no refrigerators to store medicine like insulin at home\n* food and water are very limited in parts of the island\n* cellphone service is still very limited, there is only one carrier that has some spotty service (CLARO). AT&T and Sprint are not working. I heard Tmobile may work in one or two towns\n* lines to supermarkets like COSTCO are huge and stock is limited\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
'There’s been a lot of terrible shit the past 10 months or so. Some things worse than others. \n\nBut this response (or lack there of) from the Executive Branch tops everything in that pile of shit, in my mind.  This is unforgivable. \n\nEDIT: grammar. '
'Yup, we\'ve finally sunken into "people dying" territory. It\'s really sad that a death toll might be needed to change 40% of people\'s minds.'
'Jesus fucking Christ. What the FUCK is wrong with this motherfucker? '
'“The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump,” he wrote.\n\n“Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job.”\n\nWhat the hell is wrong with Trump? Does he really want to play the victim when millions of people across the Caribbean are without basic necessities like food, water and shelter? Trump is the only "leader" in the world that could find it appropriate to act as if he\'s being victimized in all of this by "Democrats." '
"This orange traitorous fuck can seriously go eat a rancid dick.\n\nAnd that's my well thought out political opinion at this point.\n\nSan Juan and PR are both beautiful parts of our country and are our fellow citizens. \n\nFuck Trump and fuck his supporters."
"He's litterally gonna get people killed isn't he.  I want my country back"

"It's a nonsensical argument to begin with. Why are we looking at the entirety of their healthcare costs? Every soldier has healthcare costs. What amount of money is spent on healthcare for transgender soldiers that only they need and not any other group? Probably a hell of a lot less than 8 million. If they used that number, it would show how weak their argument is. "
'I don\'t want to hear we can\'t afford anything in this country. Ever again. Not since what I saw in 2008 when Wall Street shat the bed and Congress forked over 800 **billion** dollars in something like 72 hours.\n\nI\'m not looking for a "was it right or was it wrong that we bailed out those companies?" - I don\'t give a shit what anyone thinks about the wrongness or rightness of what was done. The point is it **did** happen, outside of right or wrong. If enough of us truly wanted something, if there was that pressure to our politicians for something, we would have it. Single Payer healthcare, better bridges, roads, schools, less privatization and more "public-ization" (for lack of a better word). Whatever. \n\nThe cost of this stuff, when presented from the "top" down to the rest of us living down here in the world is done to make us feel like we are greedy for wanting more/better out of our short time on this brutal, miserable, planet. It\'s just another way to punch down from those who are rich and powerful and if results in some of the working class internalizing that, believing it, and then telling other members of the working class that we are asking for too much...well, that\'s just gravy then.'
'Not to toot my own horn, but the moment I saw the Rand study that placed costs at between 2 and 8 million(or 1 to 4 Mar-a-Lago trips),  I immediately pointed this out to a friend. So any claim about it being about cost is immediately bullshit. \n\nIt was never about costs or integration concerns, it was to stir up his base. I am not sure how effective it has been, but it was always purely political.'
"Trump's reversal of the decision to allow trans-gendered people into the military has absolutely nothing to do with politics. In fact I'm sure Trump doesn't care too ways about it. No, this was purely an act of revenge - all part of Trump trying to dismantle EVERYTHING that Obama accomplished. All we've been witnessing the past 7 months is a very petty, childish man trying to one-up the one black guy that wronged him."
"It's not about saving money, and never was.\n\nIt's about bigotry, racism, sexism, homophobia. "
"It's not about cost. Assume he's lying about literally everything and each topic of discussion is about intentionally manipulating the narrative to detract from important matters like treason. It's all smoke and mirrors designed to get us riled up about something while he and his evil minions operate in the dark on other matters."
'for a country with recruiting problems, and increasing hostility worldwide, it seems kind of silly to eliminate anyone who can pass basic and wants to serve'

"Obama family travel cost taxpayers at least [$100,104,459.53](http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-trump-administration-air-travel-costs-3-58-million/) during his two terms, and he maintained the trans ban for 7.5 years of his presidency. \n\nBut that won't get gilded...  In fact, it will get downvoted, because that's what happens to facts here. \n\nHow's that piss dossier treating you guys?"
"This is completely just a means to try to inflame the culture war as a distraction from the dumpster fire that is the rest of what's going on w/ the administration.  While trans rights are important and shouldn't be ignored, liberals should be careful to not let this distract too much from continuing to ratchet the pressure on the health care debate and the Russia investigation."
"Every day is some new horror with this guy. All distractions, but they all matter, you can't even begin to focus on fighting one thing because there's always another one... Trump and all his supporters and enablers sicken me to my core."
'This ban was never about cost. Trump needs a distraction and knows how easily mainstream media is distracted. Plus it helps sure up his base which largely hates LGBT people. '
"This decission wasn't truely about the cost guys, c'on. We spend money on stupid bullshit all the time.. the military spends more on viagra.. viagra.. why is the military even spending money on viagra???"
'Jail this fucker before bankrupt America.'

'I was fairly neutral about politics and trump but his whole trans ban damn made me strongly dislike this joke '
"You mean it's really about Republican fear and hatred of anything they don't know or understand?  Never. "
"No fucking shit. You're not being fiscally responsible by making a big deal out of 0.0013% of the military members maybe costing a lot for medical while taking million dollar vacations every weekend. Republicans, again, are lying to themselves. They like this because they hate trans people almost as much as they hate America."

">“This is inherently a political problem,” Alex Howard, deputy director of the Sunlight Foundation, told Newsweek. “The government can investigate a company, even the president’s company. The problem here is that it’s about the president, and Congress is not holding him accountable for what he has done in this context. They aren’t holding hearings about the Trump Organization, and the president himself is not being transparent.”\n\nThe GOP dominated Congress isn't about to launch an investigation into Trump's involvement in laundering drug money.  Looks like it's time to appoint another special prosecutor.  It's unacceptable to allow a president who is involved in a criminal enterprise to go unpunished for his crimes - especially a president whose party began and continues to wage a 'war on drugs'."

Thanks in large part to the hit NBC television show “The Apprentice,” the Trump name was recognized all over the world and the Panama deal was structured to capitalize on that brand. For this deal, the Trump Organization would license its brand, operate the hotel and sell its expertise in managing the building, receiving a cut of every condo sale.

'Here we go. The revelations have been working their way up to the rotting head of this disgusting, rotting fish. My breaking news alert from WaPo said that he could be in legal jeopardy.

"What the mayor did was really ingenious- she has put the disaster in Puerto Rico in the headlines in a way it hasn't been for the past 2 weeks and really forced Trump to throw every resource he has available at this humanitarian crisis. She wasn't getting enough help through traditional channels so she played on Trump's fragile ego by going to the press and making him look inept.

'Far from it - FEMA literally said on CNN they have a command center for joint efforts with federal employees and local resources and the mayor of San Juan hasn’t been once and it’s been up a week and they’ve tried to get her to meet multiple times. She is being criticized heavily IN Puerto Rico by local officials and mayors of neighboring municipalities for not doing anything and spending all her time on TV criticizing the federal response when it’s been nothing but excellent - also verified by my many relatives that we’ve been able to contact on the island. The mayor was also an open supporter of the terrorist organization FALN responsible for those bombings in the 1980s.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nReally funny how quick everyone is to say Trump is doing nothing! When the actual statistics on the federal response is overwhelming, and consensus on the ground there by ouerto ricans is the same.. all while battling obligated infrastructure that was already a mess before any of these TWO hurricanes hit, being 1000 miles off the coast of Florida (an argument the other day likened it to being close to the mainland like Cuba, no.. it’s not) and dealing with decades of fierce and permeated corruption in their government.'

'Shit just got real! No advance warning, and only a day after Manafort "volunteered" a bunch of documents to the investigation. Apparently they didn\'t believe that was all he had..\n\nInteresting speculation is that Mueller is building a case unrelated to the campaign against Manafort to get him to spill his guts about the campaign and Russian ties.'

"I voted for Trump, but if there is cheating, lying, stealing, or otherwise crap going down, get him. Get all of them. I don't know how or why anyone wants scum in the office.\n\nAnd yes, that goes for anyone in office. If Hillary had done the same thing, I would want her out just as bad.\n\nEdit: Bring the hate and condescension that is the Reddit echo chamber. I feed off of your aggression and will extend olive branches anyway. It makes me stronger. "
"The most delicious thing is that for a year, conspiracy morons were convinced Hillary's no knock raid and indictment were **RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER**.  Now here we see an actual conspiracy unfolding where the Trump campaign solicited help from America's enemy, and the conspiracy crowd is remaining willfully ignorant.  Absolutely delicious."
'I was told this was a witch hunt.\n\nThis does not appear to be a witch hunt.'
'Let\'s focus for a minute on Trump\'s feelings.  He doesn\'t understand the presidency, he thinks it is like Putin\'s job, but Mueller is *moving on him like a bitch*.  Trump can\'t stop Mueller, he can\'t protect the people who hold his secrets, and [Lindsey Graham said that if Trump tried to fire Muller it would be the "beginning of the end of his presidency"](http://www.denverpost.com/2017/07/27/lindsey-graham-jeff-sessions-robert-mueller-donald-trumps-end/)\n\nTrump actually only cares about these things in terms of how they affect his ratings and cheering crowds, but even through that distorted lens, it must cause him terrible distress.  I take pleasure in his suffering, this reality is some version of Trump\'s personal Hell, where everyone is focused on him and they\'re discovering what a fraud he is.'
'So the trans ban was a distraction from the FBI raid. Wonder what happened yesterday that prompted him to threaten North Korea?\n\nMueller must be closing in on Trump with Fire and Fury. '
'To Trump:\n\nYou will die in prison, broke, alone, and hated. Enjoy.'

'> NEW YORK - Attorney General Barbara D. Underwood today announced a lawsuit against the Donald J. Trump Foundation, and its directors, **Donald J. Trump (“Mr. Trump”), Donald J. Trump, Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump.** The petition filed today alleges a pattern of **persistent illegal conduct, occurring over more than a decade, that includes extensive unlawful political coordination with the Trump presidential campaign, repeated and willful self-dealing transactions to benefit Mr. Trump’s personal and business interests, and violations of basic legal obligations for non-profit foundations.** The Attorney General initiated a special proceeding to dissolve the Trump Foundation under court supervision and obtain restitution of $2.8 million and additional penalties. The AG’s lawsuit also seeks a ban from future service as a director of a New York not-for-profit of 10 years for Mr. Trump and one year for each of the Foundation’s other board members, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. The Attorney General also sent referral letters today to the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission, identifying possible violations of federal law for further investigation and legal action by those federal agencies.\n\n[Link to Full press release] (https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/attorney-general-underwood-announces-lawsuit-against-donald-j-trump-foundation-and-its)'

'That was quick. Underwood has barely been in the job for a month.\n\n>In the suit, filed Thursday morning, attorney general Barbara Underwood asked a state judge to dissolve the Donald J. Trump Foundation. She asked that its remaining $1 million in assets be distributed to other charities and that Trump be forced to pay at least $2.8 million in restitution and penalties.\n\n>Underwood also asks that Trump be banned from leading any other New York nonprofit for 10 years — seeking to apply a penalty usually reserved for the operators of small-time charity frauds to the president of the United States.\n\n>In the suit, Underwood noted that Trump had already paid more than $330,000 in reimbursements and penalty taxes since 2016. New York state began probing the Trump Foundation in response to an investigation by The Washington Post.\n\n>But she asked the judge to go further, and require Trump to pay millions more. She said a 20-month state investigation found that Trump had repeatedly violated laws that set the ground rules for tax-exempt foundations — most importantly, that their money is meant to serve the public good, and not to provide private benefits to their founders.\n\n>“This resulted in multiple violations of state and federal law,” Underwood wrote in the legal complaint.'

"**Things Republicans believe without proof:**  \n-Hillary Clinton has a child sex-slave ring in the basement of a D.C. pizzeria.  \n-Obama is a Kenyan-born Muslim Terrorist Marxist revolutionary.   \n-Climate change is a hoax perpetrated by NASA and China to make Al Gore rich.  \n-Sandy Hook was a false flag operation to take away everyone's guns.  \n-There is a widespread Deep State conspiracy to destroy Trump's Presidency.  \n-Mueller's real investigation is into Hillary Clinton.  \n-George Soros bused in 40,000 black people to vote for Doug Jones.  \n-Ebola liquefies peoples in sides.  \n-US universities are brainwashing students into becoming liberals.  \n-The Mainstream Media is a widespread conspiracy to push a liberal agenda.  \n  \n**Things Republicans refuse to believe despite multiple sources:**  \n-Donald Trump, who is openly defying a near-unanimous Congressional bill to impose sanctions against Russia, who inexplicably defends Russia and Putin whenever possible, who relied on multi-million dollar loans from Russia to bail out his businesses, who appointed an expert in Russian business to be Secretary of State, whose campaign managers built careers by furthering Russian interests around the globe, whose children and son-in-law deal heavily with Russian businesspeople, may in fact be compromised by the Russian government; and, this has been alleged by at least two independent sources, one source being a highly decorated career British intelligence officer who specialized in spying on Russia.\n\nYou. Can't. Make. This. Shit. Up."
"> Cody Shearer, a controversial political activist and former journalist who was close to the Clinton White House in the 1990s\n\nThis will simply feed the right's bullshit conspiracy narrative."
'Serious question: What happens when Trump is found guilty of ________ and refuses to step down, and congress doesn\'t do anything about it? What happens when the protests go on, and the brainwashed base believes that the liberal democrats are the ones trying to overthrow their republic? Trump blew a whistle for the "2nd amendment people" during his campaign. Are we supposed to believe that that won\'t resurface if this were to happen? We are living a scary timeline.  '
'This is a dossier written by a political activist journalist.  Nothing new at all, not even verifying anything in the 1st dossier.\n\nThis is simply a distraction from the memo and casts the FBI in bad light, again.'
'>"Among other things, both documents allege\xa0Donald Trump was compromised\xa0during a\xa02013 trip to Moscow\xa0that involved lewd acts in a five-star hotel.\n\nIf DJT is compromised, especially after After Stormy Daniels deal and all the infidelity reports against him so far, then what\'s on those tapes must be terribly embarrassing for him.\n\n>Shearer is a controversial figure in Washington. Conservative outlets have accused him of being part of a “hatchet man” and member of a “secret spy ring” and within Clinton’s orbit. There is no evidence that the Clinton campaign was aware of the Shearer memo.\n\n\n>But other people who know Shearer say he is not just a Democratic party hack and there is no evidence that his memo was ever sought by Clinton campaign officials.\n\n>Sources say that while he lacks the precision and polish of a seasoned former spy like Steele, Shearer has also been described as having a large network of sources around the world and the independent financial means to pursue leads."\n\nI know these things are gonna come out eventually but..  Who leaked the existence of this dossier and why is it out the day after McCabe quit? Yet another author\'s name is linked with Clintons again. That\'s gonna complicate how things are reported even more.. '
'I posted this in another thread, but I’m reminded of that story about Putin stealing Kraft’s Super Bowl ring. \n\n\nStory goes, Kraft (billionaire owner of the Patriots NFL team) met Putin in Moscow. \n\n\nPutin asked if he could take a look at Kraft’s huge diamond-encrusted super bowl ring. So he takes it off and hands it to Putin. Putin looks at it, looks Kraft dead in the eye and puts the ring in his pocket. \n\nKraft laughs nervously but is too embarrassed or intimidated to ask for it back, he later gets aides to ask for it back but Putin’s people straight up say it was a gift by Kraft.\n\n\nSo that’s what Putin is doing to our democracy. He’s looking Washington dead in the eye while he destroys it, while we don’t do a single damn thing about it. '
">The second memo was written by Cody Shearer, a controversial political activist and former journalist who was close to the Clinton White House in the 1990s.\n\n>Unlike Steele, Shearer does not have a background in espionage, and his memo was initially viewed with scepticism, not least because he had shared it with select media organisations before the election.\n\nOkay, so the author of this Dossier is much less credible. Fair enough, *but* the fact that he independently acquired corroborating stories is very fascinating. \n\n> The Shearer memo was provided to the FBI in October 2016.\n\nThis is really interesting. The fact that the FBI had this dossier 3 months before Steele's was released by BuzzFeed helps make this seem much more credible. \n\n> It was handed to them by Steele – who had been given it by an American contact – after the FBI requested the former MI6 agent provide any documents or evidence that could be useful in its investigation, according to multiple sources.\n\n> The Guardian was told Steele warned the FBI he could not vouch for the veracity of the Shearer memo, but that he was providing a copy because it corresponded with what he had separately heard from his own independent sources.\n\nSo Steele himself actually saw the memo. I feel like this is gonna be the point of attack from the right. They're gonna harp on the authors credibility and claim that he colluded with Steele. \n\n> Shearer is a controversial figure in Washington. Conservative outlets have accused him of being part of a “hatchet man” and member of a “secret spy ring” and within Clinton’s orbit. There is no evidence that the Clinton campaign was aware of the Shearer memo.\n\nThis seems important. The biggest criticism of the Steele Dossier is that it started out as Opposition Research ~~from the Jeb Bush campaign~~ **EDIT: from the Conservative Newspaper the Washington Beacon** which was then picked up by the Jeb Bush and Clinton Campaigns. By all accounts this second Dossier was not created out of opposition motivation. "

"Why even lie about this? I just don't understand. I don't understand. What's the point of lying about something so stupid and trivial and demonstrably false? I cannot wrap my brain around this president, you guys. It hurts my head."
'He lied about the NFL and Boy Scouts phone calls also. He is suffering from extreme dementia.'
"There's no way he goes 12 hours without going on a Twitter tangent about this where he calls them failing losers or something along those lines."
"As soon as I saw Trump say that I knew he was lying. It really is scary some of the things he lies about. He's so thin-skinned. And it's sad that I can't trust literally anything he says. If he said the sky was blue, I would start to be suspicious it actually wasn't."
'I took screenshots of Trump\'s tweet and Time\'s tweet after Time tweeted and posted it to Facebook, calling Trump stupid and a liar (I only make such things visible to the Trump supporters in my Friends list). 2 older folk responded telling me I should respect the office and our leader... To which I responded with screenshots of all the times they called Obama childish names or a liar (there were a LOT), including "deceiver in chief" while using the most contrived argument to \'prove\' he was lying.\n\nThat shut them up right quick.   '
'Can I ask whatever happened to the word liar? Seriously, why the hell does no news outlet ever say it? They say he is mistaken, incorrect, misleading, etc. HE IS LYING! It not hard to say, and in actuality is much easier to say than all the words they use to dance around that one. '
"I can't even right now. I was playing an online game with a buddy and as soon as I got Trumps notification I immediately called BS and told my buddy how he was lying and there was no chance he was contacted before they made a decision.

I just sent him this article and it feels sooo good....... but I have a feeling he'll call this fake news then I'll send him the link directly to the times tweet to make him feel really stupid like most Trump supporters.

'*facepalm* did this fool really expect to not be called out by the magazine?  I can see the tweet tomorrow. "Failing times blah blah blah"'
'He could have avoided all of this drama by just not saying anything. \n\nWhy did he pick this fight out of the blue?'
"Yes... TRUMP... rejected Man of the Year because he's just so modest. For fuck's sake I think he actually takes it personally when other people are named man of the year. Like its a personal attack on him so he has to make excuses for why he didn't win. Jesus TF Christ. This idiot narcissist shouldn't be anywhere near public office."
"For those of you wondering why he lies - it's because he can. He has the power to do so and to escape the consequences most would have to face. Power exists to be exercised, and they the people have given Trump as close to absolute power as is possible. As close to ultimate political power as can be found in America, combined with his sycophants' poisonous, infinite willingness to look away. Absolute power corrupts absolutely - and is exploited absolutely. Corruption and exploitation in this case are two names for the same behavior.\n\nTHIS is why Trump is dangerous. His every transgression undercuts the shared reality that America (and most of the liberal global order) is based on. Was based on.\n\nI hate this man."
'Stop being judicious with your language.  The lying fuck lied.'
'Why does he just keep lying about stupid stuff that is easily disprovable?  This is maddening.'
"So either he's a liar that thinks we're all spectacularly stupid or he's mentally ill.  What a great guy to have in the White House!"
'I keep seeing people ask why Trump would bother lying about this. It’s because he knows the media will take the bait and now when the *actual* Time Person of the Year is announced Trump will get more attention.\n\n\n\nDear media, stop taking the bait. Ignore Trump and it’ll drive him absolutely insane. '
'Dumbass hasn\'t done a thing worth humblebragging about, so he\'s got to make shit up to humblebrag about.\n\nIs there a far, far more intense word than "pathetic" to describe this?'
'Why does this man lie about things that are so easily proven to be false.\n\nWhat the hell is wrong with his brain. '
"It's not even funny. He has an extremely serious personality disorder where he won't tell the truth about a whole lot of things, and he's the President. What a comforting thing."
'How do the assholes that voted for him even process shit like this?'
'How fucked up in your head do you need to be to support trash like Trump? You’re disgusting and pathetic people. '
'Worst president ever. '
"Why even lie about this? I just don't understand. I don't understand. What's the point of lying about something so stupid and trivial and demonstrably false? I cannot wrap my brain around this president, you guys. It hurts my head. \n\nIt is pathological. He can't help himself."

'Trump is the worst leader of a western democracy since at least WWII. At least Berlusconi put on the appearance of competence one day a week.'
"I know many of you have given up/forgotten about the Mueller investigation. However, we need to keep in mind that he's still there and still needs to be defended from Trump's public attacks.\n\nIf you guys think that Donald Trump is the worst president in American history, then we need to continue supporting the man that will singlehandedly bring him down.\n\n**Remember, Mueller was the one who** [**brought down Enron**](https://nyti.ms/2vimUXx) – the biggest fraud in U.S. business history."
">Let's just look at the last month: In that time he and his administration have picked fights with allies, buttered up dictators, accelerated a nascent trade war, and created — purely for the sake of cruelty and cynical political leverage — a humanitarian disaster on our border with Mexico. Oh, and in his spare time, he's used his Twitter account to undermine the rule of law in hopes it will save him from prosecution.\n\nAll that in just one month... it's like he is *trying* to secure his legacy as the worst person to occupy the White House"
'That is absolutely disputable. For now. Stop posting stupid shit like this.'
'Ive seen a similar post before, and Ill say it again. I dont like him, but watch your words... worst? What about Andrew Jackson and the Cherokee Trail of Tears? '
'Worst president* in history. '
"ITT: People claiming others were worse for starting the civil war, Vietnam, etc. However you must judge Presidents for the times that they lived in, and lets not act like if Trump had been President at the time that he wouldn't have been all for the civil war.. "
'Based on economy growth? No. \n\nBased on unemployment growth? No. \n\nBased on overall crime levels? No.\n\nBased on military engagements around the world? No.\n\nBased on what exactly?'
"And our obsession with having THE BEST EVER or NEWEST and the flip side THE WORST EVER or ABSOLUTE WORST!  comes to bear.\n\nAndrew Jackson sends his regards motherfuckers.\n\nThis headline is nonsense.  Trump is awful, and he's an absolute loser who now wants to cruelly extract from America what he thinks is his despite him never working for it. \n\nBut Andrew Jackson exists. "
"As horrifically bad as Trump has been, I'd say Reagan was even worse. And he had a full 8 years to reap his destruction upon this country. \n\nMuch of the atrocities he committed did during his administration are still being felt today. For starters, just have a look at the war on drugs and our mental health crisis. "
"WRONG.\n\nHe's the worst person to be president.  Not the worst president.  Not until he can match Dubya's body count anyway."
"\n>Still, unlike Trump, Buchanan also had a long history of service to the public — serving as minister to Russia, ambassador to the United Kingdom, and secretary of state. Even he was better than Trump.\n\nOkay, Buchanan had more accomplishments before becoming president. But his presidency was still far more disastrous than Trump's. The article doesn't address Andrew Johnson, who was also worse than Trump.\n\nTrump is the worst president we've had in a long time. But there have been worse."
'Not even close.  LBJ is absolutely the worst ever'
'It\'s like y\'all are forgetting Andrew Jackson.\n\nSure Trump might be mistreating undocumented immigrants, but Jackson literally murdered Native Americans in scores. One is objectively worse than the other, no matter how you look at it.\n\nAnd let\'s not forget Andrew Johnson, who is singularly responsible for the failure of the reformation of the South after the Civil War. He is the reason we had stuff like segregation and Jim Crow laws for nearly a century, crippling black people. Nothing Trump has done is a screw up of such gargantuan proportion.\n\nAnd let\'s give a shoutout to our boy James Buchanan, who did nothing while the Union fell apart, directly leading to the Civil War which resulted in hundreds of thousands of American deaths. Trump hasn\'t done a screw up that killed hundreds of thousands of Americans yet, has he?\n\nWe have had some really really bad presidents in the past. The only people who think Trump is the worst we\'ve had are people who haven\'t learned enough about American history. \n\nHe\'s not a good president, but he\'s not the worst we\'ve ever had by a long shot.\n\nHell, I\'d challenge you to name a single thing Trump has done that was worse for this country than entering the Iraq war based on lies and getting thousands of Americans killed and wasting trillions of taxpayer dollars. If we hadn\'t done that, our country would be in such a better place right now.\n\nI dare you to go to a child whose lost their father and say, "Trump being rude and disrespectful is worse than George W Bush getting your dad killed". And there are lots of children you\'d have to say that to.\n\nI\'d challenge you to say, to anyone with a basic grasp of economics, "Trump harming our ties to our allies has been worse for America than wasting trillions of dollars on a pointless war, where literally the next president can reverse all the harm Trump has done but it will take decades to recover from the cost of the war."'
'There are presidents who literally murdered other people, owned slaves, committed war crimes...\n\nBut the president who offends my feelings has a different opinion than me, and brought peace in the Korean peninsula is the worst!!!\n\n\n'
'Best economy in decades. Lowest black unemployment in the history of the US. Lowest Hispanic unemployment in US history. Lowest female unemployment in decades. Panmunjom Declaration. Denuclearization of North Korea. '
'Imagine that...Elect someone with no history of public service, or self-sacrifice, who was born wealthy, spent most of his life shitting all over everyone else. Someone who during the election openly mocked a gold star family, a POW and a disabled reporter.\n\nSomeone with a long and well documented history of doing anything to get ahead.\n\nShocker!  he turns out to be a fucking shitty president.  \n\nTrump voters have got to be some of the dumbest fucking people on Earth.  And they still believe his bullshit...'
'I would always press my father about why he hated Obama so much and time and time again he would come back with “because he is the least experienced president in history, and he doesn’t know what he is doing.” He then turned around and voted for Donald Trump. There is no fixing stupid '
'Wow, who would have thought that a C-list celebrity and failed businessman who admitted to sexual assault, mocked a reporter with disabilities, led a racist conspiracy theory against President Obama, and had no experience in politics or knowledge about domestic or foreign policy could somehow end up anything less than a stellar POTUS?'
'I feel like every headline on this subreddit is incredibly biased leaning towards the negative side of the president. Idk maybe it’s just me.'
'This is complete bullshit. Their is simply no way Trump is worse than all of Dubya, Warren Herding, LBJ, and fucking Andrew Johnson. Unless you are literally a member of the KKK than their is no way that Trump is a worse President than Andrew Johnson.'
'Didn’t one kinda betray the Natives, annex their land, kill those that resisted and gave those that survived Smallpox infested linen? Trump might have to settle for a distant second place.'
"Idk I really don't care, this kind of stuff changes no one's mind, and frankly reading it would just depress me. He's an awful, awful person at the head of a backwards, despicable party, is anyone surprised he's not great at presidenting?"
'Alltime low for unemployment amongst black men, thriving economy, wages increase and enormous job creation = worst president ever.\n\nYou guys really do just want to watch the nation burn. Jesus Christ, its indisputable that Bush was objectively worse. Someone says this about every president ever.'
'Maybe true.  I\'m more worried about the next one.  Because now that "self-interested" (to put it mildly and to try to encapsulate it all for brevity) is ok, that\'s going to mean lots of screwball terrible candidates.  Experienced, polished politicians are going to be drowned out.'
'This is such a ridiculously hyperbolic article. Is Trump a bad president? I think so. Is he an awful person? Definitely. Indisputably the worst president? Preposterous. Compare unnecessary body counts and Bush and Johnson have him beat hands down when it comes to their wars. Worse for the economy? Does nobody remember the financial crisis? Granted we don’t know how Trump’s economy will perform in the future and it probably won’t be good, but as of right now, he still has he edge in Bush. Worst for diplomacy? He might tie Bush here. FFS, Obama won a nobel peace prize just for not being Bush. And we haven’t even gotten into crap like the Patriot Act, Nixon’s war on drugs, etc.\n\nThere’s not much (if anything) nice to say about his presidency. He’s a loud mouthed, easy to hate blowhard. That doesn’t make his presidency (thus far) worse than the metric shit ton of damage someone like Bush did.'
'Is he worse than George W bush, who manufactured a war that cost Americans trillions of dollars, and resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians?'
'We are all just upvoting trump hating sentences. This statement has reached the top page of reddit dozens of times since he has become president. The only ones reading it are the ones who feed on this crap. No ones mind is being changed. Less than 10&#37; is reading the article by TheWeek. What is the point?'
'This is some click bait bullshit right here. You simply cannot say if he was the worst of all time yet, it\'s way to fucking early. It\'s too soon to place Obama, Bush, and even Clinton. Trump very well could do down as they all time worst, but stating that at this very moment he is "indisputably the worst president" is just  click bait. There is more than enough reason to shit on what Trump has done without needed to make impossible to prove claims. '
'Trash article.   Writer needs to look up the word "indisputably" and probably just say "in my opinion".\n\nWhich they are entitled to.  And it would probably be a good read and get a lot of support.   A huge issue in the country we are facing though is that if someone doesnt agree with your opinion, that makes them wrong and an evil person in every way you can imagine.  \n\nAll mediums of journalism are dead '
"I respectfully disagree. Trump is a very terrible President, but we've had some pretty damn foul ones. Resegregating the military, even served as a white supremacist from the White House itself, giving the KKK reason to come out of hiding, and I'm not referring to Trump here. \n\nOne President made a deal with a known enemy so he could win election, (and this isn't Trump I'm referring to.) No, Trump's pretty bad, but we've had very foul Presidents. Presidents who deliberately tried packing the Supreme Court, Presidents who were corrupt in and out of office, Presidents who were known for their infidelity, we've had one who shot and killed a Secretary of Treasury in a duel, one President abolished the state legislature of Maryland (granted, he had good reason to), but the point is, there have been Presidents who have committed atrocious, or at best questionable acts. Trump is just a loser idiot. We can ride him out. If we can handle Reagan or Nixon, we can handle Stupid Watergate. "
'Who knew that a reality show host with a terrible business track record, documented history of racism and xenophobia, no political experience, and a bunch of sexual misconduct accusations and admissions would be a supremely bad choice for president?\n\nI mean other than MOST OF AMERICA....'
"Bullshit.  \n\nHe will be in the running for worst president if he can pull off shooting a missile into the military's headquarters, lying us into a war of aggression for oil, and killing a million people while traumatizing two nations.\n\nHe's currently just a huckster from Queens enjoying the power of an executive branch which has been allowed unchecked power.  \n\nFor now...\n\n"
'I honestly can’t believe how this is news. We all knew this from the start. He’s a business man/TV celebrity. Not a politician... but people are still shocked when he does something stupid and detrimental to his country and the world. '
'the president after trump is going to hate life trying to undo all of trumps bullshit'

"I understand he is trying to aggressively negotiate new deals, but moves like this make it seem like he will not act in good faith no matter the deal.  The business community should realize that Trump is a loose cannon.  Yes, he took out regulations and cut their taxes, but the cannon doesn't care who it crushes as it careens around.  "
'Let\'s play the "Are you actually surprised?" game!  \n\nHere\'s how it works: If you are surprised, and you thought up until this point that Donald Trump is an effective administrator... well. you lose. \n\nAND! if you hate DT and think he\'s a fucking moron who\'s running this country into the dirt as fast as he can, and taking the rest of the planet with him... well. You also lose. \n\nReally we all lose. '
'How is their public meant to consent to be governed by someone who is so obviously incompetent, corrupt, disloyal and dishonest?  \n\n\nImagine if you sent your kid to a school and all the teachers were benefiting the kids whose parents paid them under the table. Making off handed idiotic remarks about students they disagreed with. Publicly ridiculing other teachers and students that stood up to them. Constantly lying about things they said at student teacher meetings. Started unnecessary rivalries with neighbouring schools. Then they ask your kids to follow their ridiculous rules and to cough up money each semester. \n\nTheres no way you would subject your child to that kind of eduction.   \nSo why is everyone ok for this to be the very fabric of their government?  \nYou know, the thing that ultimately effects everyone. Including your children.'
"The lesson here is not to put more tariffs on China, by the way. It's that maybe we shouldn't TARIFF OUR FRIENDS so BADLY WHAT"
"Republicans what in the flying F are you doing. To what fucking extent are you gonna get over hilary and Obama? It's been over a year and you are destroying our fucking country \n\nI think we cross a major line when we impose tariffs on our own allie? How ungodly stupid do you have to be to believe this is a good idea?\n\nWhat the fuck"
'Not only has Trump stated that trade with our strategic allies is a national defense hazard and enacted trade restricting tariffs with them, but Trump has specifically harmed US manufacturing by doing so, *while at the same time* those *specific* tariffs have *helped* Russian and Chinese manufacturing. '
'Thats because anyone who helps Iran and sticks to obamas legacy gets attacked. The EU, Mexico, India, etc. Israel fucking hated Obama and went as far as calling him antisemetic. Seeing Clinton would continue his foriegn policy that gave countries in the middle east a way to step away from hardline religious leaders and into liberal democracies, Israel went ape shit. The seriously went to war with America under democratic leadership. It was so bad, Obama secretly got the NSA FBI CIA and other op sec groups to counter Israel. Because of this, Israel began feeding russia and wikileaks dirt on democrats to use to boost trump and cause chaos for democrats. Notice how Pelosi and Schumer, the 2 biggest Israel democrats, were spared despite their large roles in the DNC. They were arguablely elevated by the democrats turmoil. Yes clinton bought the party, but that was just a piece of the puzzle that Israel and Russia exploited. Now Trump is being told what to do by Netanyahu and Trump is following orders. Thats treason. \n\nI get Israel is sensitive and an ally, but they called a war on America. Since Netanyahu beat democrats and Obama leading to israel having great influence, the knesset is giving Netanyahu greater power which means their war on America is only getting worse. Obama followed the rules and did the things the right way but Israel did not so America lost the war. Trump and Kushner have had a personal relationship with Netanyahu for ever. Netanyahu slept in kushners bed on visits.... This was a well orchestrated plan including Putin and Russia.\n\nWe know this is the case since Russia has sided with Netanyahu and Trump. Now Iran is going to the EU China and India and Trump is attacking them evonomically for Israel. We almost saw Iran bust the ayatollahs rule and become a neutral state, but now they are angry and back to hardliners and aggressive defense against the attacks on their economy and culture. \n\nHopefully Mueller will continue his searching into Israel and Russia to stop this in the future. Israel is an ally but seeing how they have treated us, we need to renegotiate our relationship. Since Israel is an ethnic militarized state, like ww2 Japan and Nazi Germany with forced military service, their people cant see their actions for what they are due to military training and psychological breaking. "There is no such thing as a free thinking soldier. He is a rule following piece of a unit. - Marines" if Our Ally works with our enemy, what does that mean?\n\nObama and the NSA found that Israel had got a hold of many Congress members to end JCPOA. Their plan was to get rid of all JCPOA supporters, or DRAIN THE SWAMP. For the NSA spying on Israel, Israel released all NSA cyber tools making america very weak. Israel was then hired by Trump to attack Obama while out of office. Our ally has no issue attacking an ex president. Thats insane.\n\nWe need to support the good side of Israel but really need to put pressure to get rid of their current powers. We need to evaluate our government to see if their religions are causing them to put Israel ahead of the people they represent. Trump and congress gave Israel a raise in aid from 64 billion to 100 billion dollars. During this, these same people said we need to cut welfare, children\'s insurance, and other vital American resources. We need to wake up to the deception. Democrats are the only group capable of this as the conservative religious zealots have torn down the wall of separation of religion and rule. Its our core and is all but gone. We shouldn\'t support any state until they follow this too.\n\nI am a sephardic Jew with family and roots in israel. But I am an American 1st and formost. Israel will always exist so we need to pressure them to exist ethically and not attack and manipulate us into putting them ahead of Americans.\n\nEdit:\n\nhttps://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/spying-israel-congress-netanyahu-217207'
'Trump is double daring his own party to impeach him.\r\n\r\nHe seriously is trying to destroy decades of alliances. Trump knows his time is up. Watch has goes into a frenzy of executive orders that will severely fuck the US and the west.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of the US need to raise up now. Rolling national strikes,  mass demonstrations.\r\n\r\nYou need to remove your president before it gets any worse'
'Here’s hoping this trade war destroys jobs in red states.'
"It's almost funny but more so sad. He is actually making a total mockery of the US, of the people, of his supporters and his haters, of the senate, of congress, of society, of his position, of his country. \n\nI try to keep the sword in it's scabbard with all the Trump news as I think jumping on every single thing he does or thinks will strengthen his position and make the real shit sound worse. But holy shit, the guy knows what he is doing, he has probably been the subject of many bribes and corruption before and knows exactly how to play the game. He is just avidly doing whatever the fuck he wants and knows that he will get away with it. \n\nHe has set him self up a buffer zone with his supporters, like this is an actual President who is openly putting his daughter in positions of power and shamelessly helping her business and making huge profit and it's disgusting. The one thing is all Trump is doing is showing a system that has already been there for years and he is just flaunting it in your faces. Trump will probably retire a very very very very rich man after this and more than likely will see through 2 terms in office and will go of into the sunset and leave the damaged USA behind him. \n\nIt is equally saddening to see the inaction of the citizens of the US, he incites hatred and racism, the Puerto Rico debacle is a total humanitarian crisis, the relentless school shooting (not a creation of Trump) but they're basically ignored by your citizens, the police murdering black people and to watch a nation of people known for their devotion to liberty sit back and take this and in some cases applaud this is gut wrenching to see. \n\nI hope that some day one of these things will annoy you Americans to do something before it is too late. Otherwise Mueller better have a really good case, because the way things are even if he recommends impeachment there is no way Trump resigns and there is no way he spends time in prison, unfortunately the bad guy has won."
"Not just good for China. The U.S. undermining our closest allies is \n Putin's wet dream."
'Look at Trump "University" the fake university he had to scam is OWN followers for millions before they were forced to sue him.\n\nWho are the people voting for this ass clown?  Billionaire hotshot from the big city - People can relate? :D'
'trump is "lowering" taxes and then getting that money, and more, back to the government through tariffs, which are ultimately paid for by consumers. If you think you got a tax cut last year, be prepared to pay it back to trump in the form of higher prices on everything.\n\nBig surprise! A liar lied! '

'**Fox News**\n\nFox News is refusing to cover breaking news revelations with in depth analysis, instead they misrepresent events, obfuscate known information, and peddle debunked conspiracy theories endangering U.S. institutions.^[[1]](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/26/fox-news-deep-state-conspiracies-372856) On the day of President Trump\'s personal attorney\'s office raids, Sean Hannity went on Fox and disparaged Special Counsel Mueller claiming that investigators had *"declared war on the President of the United States."*^[[2]](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/16/sean-hannity-cohen-attorney-trump-527897) Then we found out that Sean Hannity was a client of Michael Cohen, he never disclosed this fact until it was  discovered at a recent court hearing.^[[3]](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/business/media/sean-hannity-michael-cohen-client.html) Furthermore, a report has come out alleging that Sean Hannity speaks to President Trump nearly every weeknight.^[[4]](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/05/14/donald-trump-sean-hannity-speak-nearly-every-weeknight-report/607595002/) Moreover, when news broke that Trump\'s former Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort was indicted by Special Counsel Mueller, Fox News ignored the breaking news throughout the day and instead focused on a hamburger emoji.^[[5]](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fox-news-manafort-coverage-hamburger-emoji-trump-news-a8029821.html)\n\nSo it doesn\'t come as a surprise when Sean Hannity and Fox News push incredibly deceitful portrayals of events over the course of Special Counsel Mueller\'s investigation, omitting facts so that they create an alternate reality that doesn\'t actually exist. For example when news broke that President Trump attempted to fire Special Counsel Mueller, Fox News host Sean Hannity deflected and changed his story several times within an hour on his show; first by claiming the report was fake news, then defended Trump by claiming that he didn\'t do anything wrong omitting the fact that in doing so would be obstructing an ongoing investigation, and finally Hannity cut to a video of a car crash instead of discussing pertinent breaking news.^[[6]](https://mobile.twitter.com/MEPFuller/status/956729170700259329) \n\n**Sinclair Broadcast Group**\n\nSurely Fox News can\'t be the only cause of this distorted reality millions of Americans are entranced by, can it? You\'re not wrong to ask this question, so I\'ll provide another example - Sinclair Broadcast Group. The FCC, under the direction of Ajit Pai, are relaxing regulations in an attempt to allow a pro-Trump news organization to buy out local news stations across the country. Sinclair forces local stations to run pro-Trump news segments. A government organization that is meant to be impartial is tailoring policy to push right-wing propaganda.^[[7]](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/aug/17/sinclair-news-media-fox-trump-white-house-circa-breitbart-news)\n\n>Another cause for concern, and increased scrutiny, is what’s seen as the company’s pronounced political agenda. Sinclair forces its local stations to run pro-Trump “news” segments. In April, they hired Boris Epshteyn, a former Trump campaign spokesman and member of the White House press office, as its chief political analyst. His “must-run” 10-minute political commentary segments unsurprisingly hewed closely to the Trump administration’s message. The news and analysis website Slate, referring to Epshteyn’s contributions, said: “As far as propaganda goes, this is pure, industrial-strength stuff.”\n\nJared Kushner has admitted that the Trump Campaign struck a deal with Sinclair for pro-Trump coverage during the 2016 election.^[[8]](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-campaign-sinclair-broadcasting-jared-kushner-232764) Sinclair requires stations to air segments that tilt to the right.^[[9]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/business/media/sinclair-broadcast-komo-conservative-media.html) Just a reminder that 72% of Americans follow local news closely.^[[10]](http://www.pewinternet.org/2012/04/12/72-of-americans-follow-local-news-closely/) Keeping this in mind, Sinclair forced all its stations to recite the same script across the country that sounded like something out of a dystopian novel.^[[11]](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/business/media/sinclair-news-anchors-script.html) Sinclair forces stations to air segments created and presented by Boris Epshteyn, a former Trump White House official, 9 times a week.^[[12]](https://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2017/07/10/boris-epshteyn-sinclair-broadcasting-240359) \n\nSinclair Broadcasting has told employees not to talk to journalists about the prepared scripts.^[[13]](http://thehill.com/homenews/media/381382-sinclair-station-in-oregon-tells-employees-to-not-talk-to-press-about-script) And if you\'re wondering why more people aren\'t quitting, Sinclair makes their contracts too expensive to quit.^[[14]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-03/sinclair-employees-say-their-contracts-make-it-too-expensive-to-quit)\n\n_____________________________________\n\n1) [Politico - Fox News hosts ramp up ‘deep state’ conspiracies](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/26/fox-news-deep-state-conspiracies-372856)\n\n2) [Politico - Hannity’s ethics under fire; Fox News host’s failure to disclose his relationship with Trump attorney Michael Cohen puts his credibility on the line.](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/16/sean-hannity-cohen-attorney-trump-527897)\n\n3) [New York Times - Sean Hannity Is Named as Client of Michael Cohen, Trump’s Lawyer\nVideo](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/business/media/sean-hannity-michael-cohen-client.html)\n\n4) [USA Today - Report: President Trump and Sean Hannity talk nearly every weeknight](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/05/14/donald-trump-sean-hannity-speak-nearly-every-weeknight-report/607595002/)\n\n5) [The Independent - Fox News reported on the hamburger emoji as Paul Manafort\'s bombshell indictment broke](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fox-news-manafort-coverage-hamburger-emoji-trump-news-a8029821.html)\n\n6) [Video of Sean Hannity cutting to a car crash when news broke that Trump attempted to fire Mueller](https://mobile.twitter.com/MEPFuller/status/956729170700259329)\n\n7) [The Guardian - This is Sinclair, \'the most dangerous US company you\'ve never heard of\'](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/aug/17/sinclair-news-media-fox-trump-white-house-circa-breitbart-news)\n\n8) [Politico - Kushner: We struck deal with Sinclair for straighter coverage](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-campaign-sinclair-broadcasting-jared-kushner-232764)\n\n9) [New York Times - Sinclair Requires TV Stations to Air Segments That Tilt to the Right](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/business/media/sinclair-broadcast-komo-conservative-media.html)\n\n10) [Pew Research Center - 72% of Americans follow local news closely](http://www.pewinternet.org/2012/04/12/72-of-americans-follow-local-news-closely/)\n\n11) [New York Times - Sinclair Made Dozens of Local News Anchors Recite the Same Script](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/business/media/sinclair-news-anchors-script.html)\n\n12) [Politico - Sinclair increases \'must-run\' Boris Epshteyn segments](https://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2017/07/10/boris-epshteyn-sinclair-broadcasting-240359)\n\n13) [The Hill - Sinclair station in Oregon tells employees to not talk to press about script: report](http://thehill.com/homenews/media/381382-sinclair-station-in-oregon-tells-employees-to-not-talk-to-press-about-script)\n\n14) [Bloomberg - Sinclair Employees Say Their Contracts Make It Too Expensive to Quit](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-03/sinclair-employees-say-their-contracts-make-it-too-expensive-to-quit)'

'Aren\'t these the same fucks who said never to meet the NKs with no preconditions?\n\n-"One of the most disturbing displays of Obama\'s lack of foreign policy expertise came during last year\'s YouTube debate," Hannity said Oct. 26, 2008. "The junior senator from Illinois gave what many called a naive answer for a question from the audience about whether he would meet with the leaders of Syria, Venezuela, Cuba or North Korea without preconditions."\n\nAsked during that debate if he would be willing to meet with those leaders without preconditions, Obama said "I would," and compared that to previous presidents.-'
"I'm a Trump supporter. I think it was wrong for people to criticize Obama for wanting to make peace. I think it's wrong now for people to criticize Trump for that. Fox should absolutely be mocked for their double standards."
'For shits and giggles I turned over to Hannity last night. He got into how the left were quick to slam Trump for deals to denuclearize but the left swooned with the biggest boner when Obama got the Iran deal done. He then played clips to back it up. It was all short news bites of various newsmen and women saying an Iran deal was made. No opinions stated. Just a matter of fact that a deal was agreed upon. \n\nMy eyes rolled into the back of my head and I quicjly changed the channel. But this is what they do.  Matter of fact reporting is now liberal bias and Obama dick sucking'
'Just imagine for one moment how Fox would respond if Obama met with North Korea with no preconditions, did some photo ops with Kim Jong Un, and afterwards declared they were no longer a nuclear threat all while pushing for taking away sanctions and ending the military drills\n\nThe channel would literally implode with rage '
'Fuck Fox News and every single piece of shit that watches it. Ignorance is no excuse. '
'If Trump bumbles his way into real "denuclearization" on the Korean pennisula, which is very doubtful. but possible, that will be a good thing. But I will never forget how Republicans chastisized Democrats over the last decades for being weak and naive on foreign policy.  I will never forget their bellicose posturing with their little vile of white powder, and their axis of evil and their readiness to put the US on a war footing.'
'They deserve to be mocked. Hannity really is a unethical piece of shit “journalist”. '
'The difference is Trump and Fox scam their followers just like Trump "University" the fake university Trump used to scam his staunchest followers for millions until they were forced to sue him.  \n\nIf you haven\'t paid Trump $40K like each of these victims you\'re just an armchair follower.  These people were his biggest fanboys and they got scammed by him :D'
'"Mocked" doesn\'t mean shit. These people have no shame'
"Anything that comes out of Hannity's shit hole is pure toxic propaganda. "
'Fox news called Mr. Rogers an evil man. Nothing they say has any validity. '
'Ah, it\'s fun to look back at the stupid bullshit that gets spouted out of that gaping anus of a network.  \'Member *Freedom Fries*?  *Homicide Bombers*?  Obama *Fisting Michelle on stage* with a *Terrorist Fist Jab*?  And, I thought they were shitty people when they were "losing."  Good times.'

"Ted Lieu in twitter:\n>This tape is more evidence that @realDonaldTrump himself was directly involved in a campaign finance law violation. And because the amount exceeded $25,000, it would be punishable as a felony. #TrumpTapes also show Rudy Giuliani lied. But that's not news."
'Remember: Trump originally said he knew NOTHING about this and denied the affair entirely, so the WH arguing semantics is ironic at best and at worst a dumpster fire.'
'"Don\'t believe fake transcripts."  Cohen\'s lawyer is on fire.  \n\nIt\'s obvious he knows Trump is going to hang Cohen out to dry. '
'How the hell did this get out? Cohen? \n\nEdit: Lenny Davis (Cohen attorney) apparently. He\'s going after Trump holy shit.\n\nEdit2: ADDING A FUCKING "NOT" AGAIN! OF FUCKING COURSE THAT IS THEIR ARGUMENT!\n\nEdit3: This guys name is actually *Lanny*. Never heard of a Lanny before. '
'>Cohen tells Trump, "We\'ll have to pay." \nTrump is heard saying "pay with cash" but the audio is muddled and it\'s unclear whether he suggests paying with cash or not paying. \nCohen says, "no, no" but it is not clear what is said next.'
'[Courtesy of Seth Abramson:](https://twitter.com/SethAbramson/status/1021948819452387330)\n\n>TEN REASONS THE FIRST COHEN TAPE IS MUCH WORSE THAN ANYONE YET REALIZES. Early coverage of this bombshell exclusive on CNN has missed almost the entirety of this story, which could shape Trump\'s presidency. \n\n * REASON #1: **THERE ARE MORE TAPES**. Team Trump is playing defense tonight as though this is all Cohen can hurt them with. It\'s not—Cohen only released this tape as a defense against false info about the tape leaked by Team Trump. And if Cohen taped Trump once, he did it many times.\n\n * REASON #2: **A BAD PRIVILEGE WAIVER**. Trump waiving attorney-client privilege to let Giuliani spread *false* info about the tape not only backfired by convincing Cohen\'s lawyer to release the tape, it could also hamstring Trump\'s claims of privilege on the McDougal matter later on.\n\n * REASON #3: **COHEN IS FLIPPING**. By preemptively burning Cohen—making up a lie about the McDougal matter which had Cohen suggesting a payment in cash—Team Trump has absolutely ensured what previously was just very likely: Cohen will flip on Trump. And he has *many* stories to tell.\n\n * REASON #4: **THE AUDIO ESTABLISHES MOTIVE**. CNN edited the audio to exclude some inculpatory moments—notably, Trump telling Cohen, of damning info on his past relationships, "all you\'ve got to do is delay it for [inaudible]." That helps establish this as an *election*-related plot.\n\n * REASON #5: **IT ADDS NEW WITNESSES TO THE CASE**. In the audio, a woman\'s voice—possibly Rhona Graff\'s—is heard, meaning we now know someone else besides Cohen can testify about what Trump said in this conversation. An assistant gets him a Coke, too, so she may also be a witness now.\n\n * REASON #6: **THE FULL AUDIO ESTABLISHES CONTEXT**. CNN appears to have wrongly attributed a reference to "David" as meaning David Pecker, head of AMI. But when Cohen talks about "information regarding our friend \'David\'" he\'s referring to Trump\'s alias for adulteries, David Dennison.\n\n *  REASON #7: **TEAM TRUMP DOUBLED THE DECEIT QUOTIENT**. The audio puts Trump at the center of a pre-election plot to lie to voters about info that could have swayed their votes, but now it\'s even worse, as Trump sent Giuliani out to lie to voters about a tape they can hear themselves.\n\n * REASON #8: **TRUMP CLEARLY PROPOSES AN ILLICIT CASH PAYMENT**. Trump\'s state of mind—one-half what makes up a crime—is established by his comment about Ivana\'s divorce filings, but also by his *clear* attempt to propose an untraceable cash payment rather than (as Cohen says) a check.\n\n * REASON #9: **IVANA\'S RAPE ALLEGATIONS WILL NOW RETURN**. That Team Trump was terrified, pre-election, of Ivana\'s divorce filing getting out—and Trump\'s muffled reference to "a woman" (likely Ivana) not wanting it out—will raise new questions about whether Trump paid *Ivana* off, too.\n\n * REASON #10: **THE TAPE SUGGESTS MANY WOMEN, NOT JUST A FEW.** Cohen repeatedly says that he needs to set up a company to deal with "all the stuff, all the stuff," which tells Americans that *many* more women than Karen McDougal were paid off by Trump pre-election—as Bannon has said.'
'“Get me a coke!” Jesus. \nThis was apparently leaked by Cohen’s team, who’s going to talk to Cuomo on live tv.... this is insane. '
'What does it matter if he paid with cash or not with cash? ITS STILL FUCKING MONEY YOU ORANGE PIECE OF SHIT. '
'I\'m not a lawyer, so I don\'t know the campaign finance laws, but I don\'t think it matters whether he said "cash" or "no cash" or w/e. He could\'ve wired it, sent via bitcoin, western union, anything. The transferring the money is the violation. He\'s not saying don\'t pay it at all. The payments did happen.'
'> "I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David," Cohen said in the recording, likely a reference to American Media head David Pecker.      \nTrump interrupts Cohen asking, "What financing?" according to the recording. When Cohen tells Trump, "We\'ll have to pay." Trump is heard saying "pay with cash" but the audio is muddled and it\'s unclear whether he suggests paying with cash or not paying. Cohen says, "no, no" but it is not clear what is said next. \n\nThis is the problematic portion because the audio quality is poor so it is hard to confirm.    \nI personally think Trump said pay with cash, however, audio engineers will need to clean it up to remove all doubt.'
"It's quite hard to make out. \n\nMC: I need to open up a company for the transfer all the info regarding our friend David. I've spoken to Allan Weisselberg (sp?) about how to set the whole thing up. With funding. All the stuff. I'm all over that. I spoke to Allan about that.. When it comes time for the financing.... \n\nDT: What financing? \n\nMC: Well, we have to pay.\n\nDT. Not pay with cash? (edit: per my TV's closed captioning, it's actually 'you won't pay with cash'?)\n\nMC: No, no no. I got...  no no. \n\n__\n\nMC's lawyer is saying that only mobsters and drug dealers use cash. This tape contradicts Guilliani. \n\nThe transcript sent over from Trump's team claims that DT said 'do not pay with cash' and that he was advising MC to do it on the up and up. \n\nThis is not what the tape says, Lanny Davis asks viewers to believe their own ears. Listen to the tape. "
'The biggest news of this release is that Cohens Lawyer made the tape available to CNN of all outlets, and trashed Trump on live TV, also said that the "Presidents henchmen and toadies" are making Cohen miserable etc etc\n\n\nIf those arent clear signs that Cohen is cooperating and likely turning states idk what is.\n\nShots fired'
"I don't think I've ever seen so much undisputable proof of corruption and crimes in a government. This shit just keeps piling up and yet Conservatives will just keep screaming about Hillary when we literally have physical evidence that the president engaged in criminal activity. "
'There\'s a bit before the relevant parts talking about divorce papers with Ivana and the NYT, something that they "just need to delay 4 weeks" then it won\'t matter? I want to know what the fuck that\'s about too'
'My Trump supporting friend just messaged me saying basically "this really tarnishes the whole fake news thing". I\'m *NOT saying this will be it but I think stuff is finally getting to his supporters. It must be so tiring to defend someone so stupid who doesn\'t in the least bit give a shit about them. '
'Trump suggests paying with cash. Cohen goes "no no no". Then Trump says "check". Ghouliani was lying out of his ass.'

"He was quite possibly the best among the shitty lawyer brigade in this White House.  \n\nlol.  Trump can't even keep the shitty lawyers no one else wants, now.\n\nNow Dowd is being replaced by a Fox News TV lawyer, that believes the \\#derpstate has launched a massive conspiracy to frame Trump, and Trump's best course of action is to fire Mueller.  \n\nTrump just wants someone that will tell him what he wants to hear.  He doesn't want a qualified lawyer.\n\nWhich kind of works out, since no qualified lawyer will come within 1000 yards of this dude.\n\nHe's fucked. \n\nUpdate from CNN: https://twitter.com/ShimonPro/status/976861113060151297\n\n>Four attorneys at major law firms were approached to join Trump’s legal team in recent weeks. All turned Trump down.\n\nI knew superstar attorneys Ted Olson and Emmet Flood turned him down.  Didn't know about the other recent rejections. "
"This means one thing - Trump is going after Mueller and Dowd didn't want any part of it.  That guy he found on Fox News is going to bring about a constitutional crisis with his conspiracy theory.  Buckle up kids, the next few days are going to be insane.  "
"All this talk about leaving because Trump's guilty is hogwash. He probably is guilty of any number of things, but lawyers don't terminate representation because of that. Hell, it'd be grossly unethical to do so. \n\nWhat they do terminate for though is when the client makes the representation unduly difficult, try to use the attorney's advice to commit a crime or fraud, when the client violates a substantial obligation to the lawyer (see: not paying), the client intends to perpetrate a fraud on the court, etc. \n\nYou don't bail out on the highest profile case in possibly all of American history just because your client is obviously guilty. Hell no. That's your time to shine. If you put on a great defense and still lose, it doesn't really matter because your reputation is going to soar anyway. \n\nYou bail on a case like this because the client has put you in a position where you're going to have to violate ethics rules and possibly the law by continuing the representation. \n\nIt may be possible that Dowd has personal reasons for leaving, but unless such facts are brought to light, that is an unlikely explanation. "
'Poor Rachel Maddow, the first 20 minutes of her show will just be her reciting the names of all those fired so far.'
'Because he knows what Trump is going to do next.\n\nTrump spent a long time telegraphing McCabe\'s firing on Twitter before he actually did it.  He tweeted that McCabe was in a race against the clock to retirement and McCabe was fired less than 48 hours before retirement.\n\nNow Trump has been tweeting for a while that (1) he really, really is looking forward to meeting face-to-face with Mueller for an interview and (2) Mueller\'s investigation is illegitimate and he isn\'t needed.\n\nBecause he\'s a child, he\'s going to drop his "You\'re fired" line on Mueller when they sit down to an interview and think he\'s been amazingly clever about it all.\n\nHe feels so hounded by this man, feels like it\'s all such an injustice, that he wants to do it to the man\'s face, and it is killing him that he has to wait for it and hold a thought in his head unexpressed for so long.\n\nHe wants an interview with Mueller so he can say "You\'re fired" and see the reaction because he\'s a trash heap of a human being that\'s shockingly easy to predict and thinks that would be funny.'
'The president* is stark raving insane.  He is a rat.  He is being cornered.  He is very dangerous.  When the hell are the so-called leaders of this country going to do their duty by removing him?  This is a national disgrace.  A complete, fucking disgrace.'
'Let\'s not forget that a few months back, Trump tweeted:\n\n> I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI."\n\nGiven that Trump asked Comey to back off of Michael Flynn a few weeks later, this is tantamount to an admission of obstruction of justice. \n\nJohn Dowd later claimed that he authored this tweet. (But only that one, and that none of Trump\'s other tweets had ever been written by anyone except Trump)\n\nSo either: \n\n* John Dowd is telling the truth, meaning he admitted that his client obstructed justice. This would be a violation of ABA model rule 1.1 pertaining to competence and ABA model rule 1.6 C pertaining to the communication of attorney-client information. \n* John Down is lying, which would be a violation of ABA model rule 4.1, which prohibits the making of false statements to others. \n\nEither way, John Down is going to be in trouble with the bar association and could lose his license. \n\nAlso, either way, he\'s a fact witness. Mueller is absolutely going to investigate to determine who really sent that tweet. That means that his resignation from Trump\'s legal team was a forgone conclusion from the day he admitted he sent that tweet. '
'Hah! Get fucked, Trump!'
'Interesting how, when news like this drops, the Trump brigaders stay away. There is no way to twist this. As an attorney, I can tell you that firing a client (aka resigning in this case) takes a whole hell of a lot. If this were a court proceeding, the attorney would be required to file a motion to withdraw that may in some cases be denied by the court. '
'Imagine how well Dowd will sleep tonight.....  to walk out of a shit hole with no shit on you must be wonderful.\n'
"**John Dowd**: Goddamn Donald! You don't cooperate with the prosecutor if you're guilty! He'll skin you alive. \n\n**Trump**: Come on, he can't touch this! I'm untouchable. I'll sit down with Mueller and remind him that I'm the President of the motherfucking United States. The people love me! All this collusion with Russia, that's all just fake news. Everyone knows it. It's fake news! If Mueller asks me to resign, the American people will go crazy! They'll threaten to riot! Well, not the real American people, but all these automated social media accounts that Putin has, they'll all post about how I'm a great man being subjected to a witch hunt, and that Obama and Hillary are the ones who fucked everything up! And worst-case-scenario, I'll just flip on someone. I'll stay President, and I'll just give the special prosecutor some evidence on Bannon or Sessions or somebody.\n\n**Dowd**: You're going to flip on someone!? What the fuck are you talking about? Mueller doesn't want anyone else. He's prosecuting all these small fish so they'll flip on *you*. You're the top of the food chain. You're a goddamn SVR asset sitting in the White House. \n\n**Trump**: He can't touch this! Can't touch this! I'll fire Mueller. I'll pardon myself! \n\n**Dowd**: Yeah, I'm done with this shit. "
'This will probably be buried:\n\nAs a lawyer, there are only a few things one can do if one’s client is doing something illegal, the attorney has a moral objection to representing the client, or the attorney knows his or her client is lying. Resigning is one of those things. \n\nThis is very telling. \n\nSource: am a lawyer'
'Dowd is 77 years old. Is that not crazy to anyone else??? Why on earth would anyone sign up for this shit at 77?'
'Whenever Trump uses a petty insult like "failing New York Times," or "Fake News CNN," you know it just means they hit home. '
"Note this is **not** the same guy who threatened to resign if Trump got rid of Mueller. That guy is [Don McGahn](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/us/politics/trump-mueller-special-counsel-russia.html), the White House Counsel (ie - not Trump's personal attorney). \n\nIf McGahn leaves, that'd be a much more ominous sign. "
'What this reveals is that Donald Trump fundamentally does not understand how lawyers work. He doesn\'t understand that they work by telling you to not do and say stupid shit. In his mind that\'s just some annoying thing they do while they "be lawyers" by putting out some sort of area effect spell or force field to counter legal attacks.'
"Firing Mueller was always going to happen. And based on Dowd's departure, it looks like it may happen soon.\n\nYou need to remember that all roads lead back to *politics*. The GOP congress has not acted so far because they are in control. But the tides are turning against them politically. Every special election has indicated their destruction in the fall. They are deeply unpopular outside of their idiot base. They are losing gerrymandering cases across the country. They will accomplish nothing significant before the elections because of the Trump white house shitshow. As devoid of ethics as the GOP is, they are political creatures, and political creatures will do what is necessary to ensure their survival.\n\nIt's my hope the Mueller firing will be the tipping point. Watch the *polls* when it happens. A GOP congress will only act if it has no other option. So, in a sense, a reaction to a Mueller firing isn't on congress, it's on us."

"Awww shit. *popping sound intensifies* \n\nThis was the money he was *gonna* donate right? Oh my, tst tst.\n\nEdit: NVM just doing illegal shit with other people's donations.    \n\nEdit edit: it is legal. He is just the first president to use these funds for a criminal defense ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
'>**The U.S. Federal Election Commission allows the use of private campaign funds to pay legal bills arising from being a candidate or elected official.**\n\n>Trump would be the first U.S. president in the modern campaign finance era to use such funds to cover the costs of responding to a criminal probe, said election law experts.\n\n>John Dowd, Trump\'s lead lawyer, declined to say how the president\'s legal bills were being paid, adding: "That\'s none of your business."\n\nThat\'s basically the whole story. Not big news.\n\n**e:** I bold texted the relevant part that makes this not big news, since y\'all are downvoting me out of your need for everything to be a bombshell. Do you think I\'m actually *defending* Trump or something? lol\n\n**e2:** from -30 to +17. Had no idea this would be so controversial. This sub is weird. '
"And now we know why Trump filed for reelection on inauguration day and has subsequently been campaigning and holding rallies since. \n\nTwo possible realities: either Trump isn't as rich as he claims and can't afford his legal bills, or he wants the taxpayers to subsidize them. \n\nI'm not sure which is worse. "
"Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Governor Bentley (ex-Alabama governor) finally go down for using campaign funding to defend himself from a criminal investigation?"
'I miss the days when republicans held the president to higher standards than the bare minimum of what the law says is legal or illegal. Remember when they were mad at Obama for golfing after announcing a terror attack? '

"He just can't help himself. He has now lost both sides of the argument, whether the story is real or not, he shot himself in both feet.\n\nIf the moron story is true, he has now vehemently denied something and is wrong about it, and he was of course called a 'fucking moron' by one of his most senior staff members.\n\nIf the story is indeed fake, he has publicly insulted (yet another) said senior staff member despite him not having done anything. Coupled with his undermining tweets on Tillerson's work with NK, this frays the relationship in the other direction, as we're assuming Tillerson never called Trump a moron but is now still being thrown under the bus for it anyway.\n\nIt isn't how you show yourself to be a good dealmaker, negotiator or diplomat.

"Remember how much trouble W got into after Katrina because he only flew over the city? Really it was just bad optics, but that tone deaf response to a disaster defined his presidency. This is going to be so much worse for Trump. People are now dying because he's a narcissist. "
"I hope more media figures follow Joe's footsteps here.\nIt is so painful watching the country I love come under attack after attack by this President. This culture of hate that he spews cannot be allowed to be sustained."
"I'm glad he said it, but Scarborough is so full of shit I can take him seriously as the voice of anything.  All this time he watched and egged on the fanatical element of the GOP and then when it turned on him, all of a sudden, he's a victim.  That's what fanatics do asshat!"

'This is the second time I copy paste this comment I wrote from another r/politics thread. I feel the need to share this information as much as possible because it seems that a lot of people don\'t understand why his comments are so important and insulting:\n\nThis is the most disgusting and vile thing he has said about us to date.\n\nI\'m here in Puerto Rico and I can confirm that what Trump just accused us of is a straight up lie so as to portray us a leeches on the US Fed. Government. This is a game that has been played out many times in the past few years so as to give Puerto Ricans a bad name in the mainland; a prominent example being the ads that were aired before the PROMESA Bill was passed that said we just wanted free money and we\'re a strain on the US economy. \n\nI know of hundred of relief efforts by our diaspora in both mainland US and even Europe, trying to organize food, medicine, and all types of aid for us from afar. Care packages being sent over, community efforts to bring in money and aid as soon as possible. I know of dozens of local community efforts to provide food to the hungry, organized solely on what money and resources we have left...and I would know of more if our communication infrastructure wasn\'t so devastated. I know of dozens of community brigades being organized and executed to clear up roads, take care of the abandoned elderly who were literally sleeping in their own feces, and to rescue people trapped in their homes. I know of volunteer workers and truck drivers that have showed up to the government\'s and FEMA\'s headquarters in the convention center who have been turned away because of some fucking stupid bureaucracy that won\'t put them to good use unless they are listed and then called back to help, when these same volunteers don\'t have signal in their homes and wasted what little gasoline they have left to get there. I know of hundreds of local businesses that have been doing everything possible to organize and continue operating and producing against all odds. We\'ve been carpooling to work since Monday, using our bosses personal generator and huddling up our office and warehouse team in a consolidated space. We, the people of Puerto Rico, are doing everything we can with a devastated infrastructure and help that took too long to get here. Trump was too busy golfing and tweeting about NFL players to notice us until 5 days after the hurricane hit.\n\nBut to play this "leeches" game now, when lives are at stake, where hundreds have died post-hurricane because of their life support and necessary medicines being cut off because of generators losing power... it\'s just too much to read. We are owed this help as any US citizen deserves. Thousands of our people have died in US wars, our territory of Vieques had been used for over 60 years in bombing experiments with radioactive materials and lead, our citizens were used in covert contraceptive experiments in the 40s, without our knowledge, that lead to a revolution in the industry, Dr. Cornelius Rhodes tried and wanted to exterminate our people by infecting us with cancer and moved on to be a celebrated military doctor. Our economy has served as a tax heaven for US companies that have left when loopholes where taken away and tanked our economy, our agriculture was forcefully turned into a monoculture of sugar and when corn-syrup arrived we lost almost the entire industry, being forced to ship in 80% of our food at almost double the cost of any state because of the Jones Act...and we were just now reviving this industry as part of an effort to revive our economy with local industry when Hurricane Maria came to take it all away. We contribute in tax dollars, in human capital and in natural resources to the US, and he dares call us leeches on the system that we have no choice but to be part of....I don\'t have enough curse words for the massive turd he is laying on a people ravaged by a natural disaster exacerbated by climate change, which he also fucking denies. What a piece of shit. We deserve better.\n\nEdit: I found this article yesterday that perfectly summed up what has happened in Puerto Rico to date, check it out if you\'re interested in more information: http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/how-puerto-rico-is-becoming-trumps-katrina-w505523'
'You have to be a special kind of asshole to attack people when they are in the middle of a disaster and hurting. Doesn\'t matter if they attack you or not. You would think decent people would understand this. You would think they would have the ability to have some empathy and look at the situation and say, "I get it. You are in a tough position right now. Let\'s work together to make this better". Nope. 45 and his supporters are not even capable of that. In their minds, they are the real victims here.'
"It's so fucked up...  American politics is such a dumpster fire, that I find myself agreeing with Joe Scarborough.   "
"Heyyy do yourself a favor and don't ever sort by controversial. Can't believe some of these Republicans are trying to make it look like lefties are using Puerto Rico as a political stunt to make him look bad. He looks bad because he's been completely absent to a disaster effecting hundreds of thousands of Americans. These aren't even foreigners we're talking about. You want to say Trump is being praised for his response by the Puerto Rican governor? Trump already condemned the island, you think the Puerto Rican governor calling out the president on his incompetence is going to help the situation? You guys are so fucking dumb it's surprising any of you even figured out how to vote. In all honesty, anybody standing by this man at this point needs to be evaluated for mental retardation. "
'Trump will get away with this because racism. '
'this guy is pure scum and pure evil.  \nNo ounce of leadership is in this fuckbag whatsoever.  \nFuck this asshole.'
'Most hated president in history. Send him to Russia. '
'Poor leadership is coming up with a bad game plan to attack this problem.\n\nCriminally negligent leadership is golfing while Americans die.'
"This is just embarrassing at this point. I rarely comment on political threads anymore but this is just terribly sad and embarrassing. Americans are dying and our president is at his golf club shooting insulting tweets at the people pleading for help. He's worse than I ever imagined he could be. "
"I have conservative friends that are saying it's all FEMA's fault. That Trump has done everything he can do. That they have like 3000 containers but refuse to send them... They'll blame anything besides their pick for prez."
'My god. Did he actually go to play golf while this shit is happening in Puerto Rico. Man, this is fucked up. '
"All part of the plan. The water gets hotter, the poor animal now senses something is wrong but it's too late.\n\nAt each step, Trump gets away with more, making each travesty the new normal. Each crisis is an opportunity for him to test how far he can push everyone around."
"Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens.  There are over 3.4 million of them on the island.  That's more than the population of Mississippi.  And they're all American Citizens with the right to vote in any election.\n\nThey should all move to one state, like Alabama, or Mississippi, or Louisiana, all at once, and flip that red state forever.  Just vacate the island, move into a red state, make it blue, and fuck this president, and that state's reps in the ass next November."
'Whenever I think Trump cant be more inhumane and dumb, he proves me wrong. There must be a limit somewhere?'
'Is this headline a little sensationalist?  You betcha\n\nIs there a lot of truth to the headline?  You betcha\n\nAmericans die every day, whether it\'s from medical issues, etc.  the president is entitled to his vacations.\n\nThe argument shouldn\'t be "you shouldn\'t be golfing while Americans die".\n\nThe argument should be "it\'s fucked up to call people  who just suffered a storm they had never seen before "lazy" while you golf from the comfort of a home that hasn\'t been ravaged by a storm"\n\nJerkoff'

"Makes the case that there is a big possibility that he didn't even read the 4-page memo that was sent to him by Nunes.

"His show is meant to anger people, not inform then.\n\nDo what everyone who doesn't watch his show does: ignore his dumb, manipulating ass."
"Hannity and the right didn't care when Trump mocked a disabled reporter. "
'Proof that this world is a horrible, evil place:  Sean Hannity lives in luxury making $30 million a year to spread Nazi propaganda while innocent children are being gassed to death in the Middle East.'
"I'm an old guy (51). Imho the two of them shouldn't behave like bickering teenagers if they want the rest of the world to view them as grown ass men.\n\nJust saying..."
'oh good, we’re still listening to this lying racist anti-american hypocrite '
"Call me crazy, but I think it's wrong to mock either of those women. However, it's *more* wrong to mock one then act high-and-mighty and throw slurs at someone else for mocking the other. \n\nYou can't pretend to suddenly care about people mocking the first-family when for 8 years you were not only silent on those throwing racial slurs at the Obama's, but you [were *a part of it*.](https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2012/06/20/to-hannity-ann-romney-is-off-limits-but-michell/184518).\n\nSo yeah, while I think Kimmel's joke about Melania's accent was not funny (I'm just not a fan of Kimmel's comedy, tbh), Sean Hannity of all people has *zero* high ground to stand on and call someone else out for this, when for EIGHT YEARS he took part in the *actual* slandering of Michelle Obama and her children.\n\nHannity doesn't give a shit about Melania, or about people saying negative things about the President or his Wife, he just saw an opportunity to score cheap points with Conservatives and pretend to stand on a soap box for Melania and took it."
"And then he mocks Guillermo's accent right after. It was a bit of jest by a comedian who makes fun of his friends and himself all the time. It was so tame but Hannity looked like he was about to start crying he was so upset. When your whole existence is about being mean-spirited you just can't fathom humor.\n\nSame people shitting on teenagers who just survived a mass shooting. But Melania's accent, that shit is sacred."
"I wonder if Hannity's audience remembers what it used to feel like to actually get outraged on a matter of consistent principle as opposed to having outrage be a conditioned, Pavlovian response to his style of reporting. And while I think it's morally correct to be outraged by what Trump does on a regular basis, I hope the left lets the habit of getting outraged go post-Trump so we don't become the same thing. "
'Sean Hannity can go sit in sugar, I’m sick of him poisoning my dad’s head with nonsense\n\nmy dad’s a jackass sure but I can make progress with him when this motherfucker isn’t waving his pen of moral authority around hating the Chinese or whatever he’s doing these days '
'Republicans have a pretty long history of getting personal. Rush Limbaugh used to call Chelsea Clinton ugly when she was 12. Keep in mind this is when the internet was in its infancy and Rush was arguably at his peak, and he was calling a middle school girl ugly. '
"Sean Hannity could be kidnapped by ISIS, forced to undergo the worst that humanity has to offer, and I can't say with any level of certainty that I would care.  He is the absolute worst that Fox News has ever violated America with.  He'll whine about Trump's Sugar Baby being insulted on late night television, then turn around and laugh with people calling Michelle a man and a monkey.  He'll attack a shooting survivor for not having the right politics and criticize him for being a high school student, but he's a fucking college dropout.  Hannity has the same verifiable education level as the very high school student he attacks.\n\nHonestly, fuck Fox."
'Kimmel was wrong to criticize Melania\'s accent and has been acting wrong throughout this whole situation, but Hannity, like it has been said, is being hypocritical. He is in no place to criticize Kimmel like he has been. I do not know if he has apologized for his remarks about Michelle, and if he did, this is a equally immature way to go and criticize someone for doing the same thing one\'s self had done. Hannity escalated the situation, and Kimmel too, but I believe he started off by calling Kimmel an "assclown." That is not right, and immediately escalates the situation\n\n(Hope able to use that thing above here, was used in tweet, if not, apologies everyone and moderators)\n\n\n'
'Kimmel should have never apologized.\nNever apologize for defendable comedy.\nHannity is just pretending to be offended so people will watch his show at 9pm. Its fabricated insane delusional nonsense outrage for ratings. Hannity had zero legs to stand on.\nEveryone should be able to comprehend the context/intent of a joke. No company will join the sad attempt at a Kimmel Boycott. Hannity + Fox News primetime & mornings is the most destructive delusional insane form of fake journalism/opinion/entertainment ever created. \n\nI think ultimately, the Daily Beast article calling out Kimmel & other comedians for using homophobic jokes is what made Kimmel apologize. Yeah apologize for that. But never apologize to fucking scumbag piece of shit Hannity.\n'
"I'd say I am pretty conservative and wouldn't vote for a democrat, but fuck sean hannity, holy shit I hate that dude. He was talking about his brown belt in karate in regards to beating up kimmel. He's a fucking joke. "
'According to Forbes, Hannity makes $36 million a year.\n\nWhat the actual fuck is wrong with this country?\n\n\n'
"Bottom line: Neither Hannity nor his viewers care what a shitty person Hannity is, or Melania for that matter.  They like it. They're shitty too. "
'Is anyone really surprised that idiotic, fat sack of human waste lacks the self awareness to recognize his own hypocrisy?'
'Michelle Obama was the first lady with former President Barack Obama and Melania Trump is currently the first lady. If Hannity says you can’t mock the first lady, yet they’ve mocked the previous first lady, then they’re being a hypocrite.'
"Hannity is a genuine piece of shit.  Want to know how horrible shit like genocide happens?  People like Sean Hannity encourage and enable evil men, and spout propaganda to the masses so they are a little less uneasy with seeing a fucking atrocity.  Defend them until the end.  There isn't a single thing Hannity wouldn't do for Trump.  Provided Trump could get his dick hard, Hannity would suck it if he were asked to.  He may even suck it if it was flaccid."
'Racist piece of crap is a racist piece of crap...'
"He's such a fake ass prick"
'Person who eats shit says some hypocritical shit.'
'In Hannity’s defense, he’s a hypocritical shit bucket with no recognizable sense of ethics. '
"A: Hannity is a douchebag.  End of story.\n\nB: Melania's accent was the source of the original joke.  Her accent is quite interesting.  Have you ever actually thought about it?  She's been in the U.S. for 22 years, but she still speaks as if she arrived recently.  The way she struggles with English makes me wonder how much English she speaks in her everyday life, if any.\n\nGranted, she chose the life she now leads.  She chose Trump.  She chose to date him, she chose to marry him, and she chose to have a child with him.  She knows her husband cheated on her with multiple women and he didn't even wear a condom.  She knows, and she chose to stay.  Those were her choices, so I don't feel sorry for her...  but I have to assume she is incredibly lonely.\n\nShe's been in the U.S. for 22 years, but the way she struggles when speaking English makes me assume she isn't speaking English in her daily life.  I wonder what her daily life is these days.  Who does she even speak to?  Certainly not her husband and the family she married into.  I can't imagine how lonely and isolated she must feel.\n\n...but she chose it."

'>While the meeting was underway, news broke that one of the Republican members of the commission, Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation’s Election Law Reform Initiative, had written Attorney General Jeff Sessions in February to express anger that Democrats and “mainstream Republicans” would be allowed to serve on it, claiming they would seek to obstruct the investigation. \n\nCrazy'

I wonder what would happen next? How would Donald Trump react?\n\nIt's an interesting time to be alive. Of course they all are, I suppose... "
"Dunlap's lawsuit was a large reason why they had to shut this farce down in the first place. Now they don't want to follow a judge's order."

"Fox News must be laughing its ass off right now. They've managed to create so much blind, visceral hatred of Democrats that 35% of the country thinks Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were the most corrupt politicians in history, but shit like this is fine."
'This story is the most Trump thing ever. A conspiratorial claim about Trump’s enemies, a fraudulent commission convened to investigate it, complete secrecy, leaks about dysfunction and infighting, the whole thing shut down before producing any results, lawsuits, snd a failure to disclose. That pretty much sums up his administration.'
"Can they be held in contempt? If people can just ignore a judge's orders without repercussion, doesn't that mean our checks and balances no longer function?"
"I think the reason for disbanding this effort has more to do with the fact that they were beginning to realize there are many more disenfranchised voters that lean left than that lean right.  Also, that staunch conservative secretaries of state and county clerks are much more likely to cheat than some poor schmuck who tries to vote twice.\n\nIf they continued with their efforts, they would no doubt run right into voter suppression laws in many southern states and unearth situations where local officials skewed the results in favor of conservatives.  They most likely were in the process of learning that fixing voter registration laws and cracking down on locals would result in more votes for the left, not less.\n\nNever underestimate modern conservative deceit.  Trump's continuous lies are just a manifestation of  the right's decades long efforts to bullshit the public into thinking their policies benefit anyone but their donors."

'[Here\'s the official White House press release on the subject.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-presidential-advisory-commission-election-integrit/)\n\nIt looks like he\'s trying to spin this as being the states\' fault -- he claims he is "avoiding endless legal battles" that attempting to pursue this would entail. This way, he doesn\'t have to go through with the commission but he can stand by his earlier allegation that there were millions of illegal votes. '
'He claimed thousands of illegal voters?!?!?\n\nFuck that.  He claimed MILLIONS of illegal voters. '
'Oh my god. \n\n“We’re dissolving the voter fraud commission even though we totes have evidence it’s rampant, we don’t want to waste tax payers money.”\n\nThis should infuriate the Cult Right. If they believe there is rampant fraud, then he’s telling them he doesn’t really care. '
"holy shit, I can't believe he even folded let alone so quickly over a few lawsuits...\n\n...I have no clue why, but all my instincts are telling me to either go hide in the closet or under the guest bed???"
"So let's recap. Trump thinks that there's widespread voter fraud (there isn't) and uses the excuse of tax payer funds being wasted as his reasoning for disbanding the commission. But he's perfectly ok with wasting our money playing golf. I'm starting to think it has nothing to do with money and everything to do with the fact that states told Kobach to fuck himself. "
"I particularly love how Trump claims there were *just* slightly more illegal voters than the margin he lost the election by. \n\nLike, 1 million illegal votes would be a huge fucking deal. Or 2 million. But he says there were 3 million, and *by sheer coincidence* he lost the popular vote by 2.9 million!\n\nIt's so fucking transparent. He's the most predicable liar I've ever seen."
'For all the time and tax money wasted on this, at least issue a one paragraph Official Report so everyone knows about the three documented cases of actual voter fraud in the 2016 Presidential elections:\n\n1) A lady in Des Moines voted twice for Trump.\n2) A Texas man, falsely claiming to be a Trump election employee testing out the election security, also voted twice for Trump.\n3) A Republican election judge in Illinois filled out and sent in an absentee ballot for her dead husband.'
'Waste of money. Witch Hunt'
'Lol. Get fucked, Trump. '
'Trump dissolves fraudulent commission investigating made up voter fraud'
'lemme guess… they could NEVER actually come up with any voter fraud in the election (at least on the Democratic side), and after repeated meltdowns, Trump just lost his cool and decided to dissolve the entire panel for not telling him what he wanted to hear, as if he was Dr. Evil chastising his evil cronies for their "insolence" and hitting the buttons that sent them down to the firey pit below.'
'I’m just trying to understand this. Was there evidence coming to light of actual voter fraud or was this legitimately disbanded because it based on allegations with no basis in fact?'
'Blames states for refusing to turn over voter information, okay to refuse to turn over tax returns. '
'a lot of people seem confused and think that Trump dissolved a commission that existed before it was created by his delusional argument that he actually won the popular vote.\n\nTrump created this. It was a scam. He is dissolving it because it\'s an obvious scam that some of the states said "fuck off" to.'

Then it turned out that he never even met the instructors, most of whom knew nothing about real estate, they were just professional seminar people.  The material that was presented in PowerPoints was just bullshit taken from his books, and the instructors were explicitly told to upsell.

He’s promoting shit talking at the internet troll level. '
"lol what? In what fucking way is he an accomplice? He didn't ask anyone to kill anyone. Anne Frank Center should get their funds cut off."
"Guys... come on. This is making us look bad. Let the President make himself look bad, we don't have to start calling him an accomplice to domestic terrorism. The picture isn't violent and it's not of his opponents getting run over. The cartoon clearly depicts (originally) a donkey (democrats) trying to stop Trump and not being able to. Someone plastered CNN over it but it's the same idea."
'Then Obama was an accomplice to domestic terrorism when police officers in Dallas were shot and killed by a Black radical that subscribed to the ideology pushed by Obama and the Democratic party.\n\nIf you want to play this game, Dems, we can play this game.'
"Lol wut? Can anyone articulate how he is an accomplice to domestic terrorism? No rhetoric, just some facts please?\n\nIs anyone forgetting that previous administrations have funded rebel and separatist groups in other countries? I know that's not domestic, but it is WAY closer to supporting terrorism than anything I've heard in the news about Trump."

Ultimately, by politicizing Anne Frank, the group may undermine her legacy.'
"This is moronic. Leave his Twitter alone! Yes, he's grossly in violation of the TOS and human decency, but we need to see the daily proof of his lack of qualifications for the office. Think of it like a stream of brown liquid escaping from an ass. Without it, people might think someone was healthy. With it, we know there's a serious problem.\n\nIf anything, manually set his follower count so it never equals or exceeds Obama's. It will drive him crazy."
"How about Twitter purges its ISIS and far left and right hate group accounts first. As much as we dislike the don, he's not a nazi sympathizer."
'Was President Obama an "accomplice to domestic terrorism" by failing to label Nidal Hassan\'s attack as an Islamist terror attack and called it "workplace violence" instead? How about when he failed to call the San Bernadino terrorists an act of terror, but instead said how it\'s hard to unravel their motive? \n\nI\'m tired of the double standard on the Left. Trump has said that there is no place in the US for the KKK and Nazis, yet he\'s called an "accomplice to domestic terrorism" when for 8 years Obama refused to acknowledge the role of Islam in terror attacks and nobody on the Left batted an eye.\n\nYes, Trump is an asshole for cozying up with white-supremacists, but by the same token, Obama is an asshole for cozying up with black-supremacists/race-baiters and refusing to condemn Islamic terror attacks. '
"Can someone explain to me how Trump supports terrorism? I'm genuinely confused"
'Both sides are officially insane.  Holy shit this is such a joke.'
"Remember when the father of the murderer behind the largest mass shooting in US history sat behind Hillary Clinton at her rally?\n\nI remember, and I remember the media's silence.\n\n\nRemember when a BLM supporter murdered five police officers in Dallas and Obama lectured the police during their memorial?\n\nI remember.\n\nYour outrage is selective and partisan."
'So Trump now somehow aided white nationalist terrorists despite disavowing them in everyway possible. But we are ok with Obama giving guns to drug cartels? So who aided terrorists again? '

"What a fucking joke of a subreddit. I hate Trump as much as the next guy but this echo chamber is probably one of the most pathetic things I've seen Reddit produce"
"Leave it to the anne frank center to be too blind to realize that the CNN reporter in the cartoon they're so angry about isn't being hit by the train, rather he's trying to stop the train. That's the difference between news and fake news, if you have to mislead people for a story you should fuck off."
'The Anne Frank Center twitter is really an embarrassment to Anne Frank. A liberal activist bought the rights and now uses the twitter to push propaganda. '
"That's a bit ridiculous.  There's whackos on both the left and the right.  Just the other day an antifa guy went on a shooting spree.  You can't blame others for their actions just because you hate Trump."
'What\'s worse? \n\nThat there are hundreds upon hundreds of comments here in complete approval of removing the President\'s right to speak freely for no reason other than you were told not to like him?\n\nOr that not one of you have provided evidence that Donald Trump is "an accomplice to domestic terrorism"?

"According to Homeland Security, there are approximately 3K KKK and NAZI members in the United States.\n\nThe Venitian hotel in Vegas can fit 20K guests, so if you rounded them all up and put them in that hotel it wouldn't even be 1/6th full.\n\nYet Reddit wants to convince us we have NAZIs everywhere in America, supported by our President that has a Jewish daughter that he favors over his sons. *facepalm*\n\nGive it up already.   The 2017 McCarthyism was annoying enough; [listen to Obama's advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS2a44F5TgM).   Although speaking of Obama, does anyone recall his condemnation of the BLM murder of police officers?   Oh, he invited them to the white house afterward?   And how many times have other vehicle based terrorist attacks made it to the front of /r/politics when it didn't fit the agenda?   Interesting selective outrage.  "
"Trump is an incompetent idiot who I hate and who is terrible for America, but this is hyperbolic and weakens the credibility of the Anne Frank Center.\n\nYes, Trump has appealed to Alt Right people and conspiracy theorists, and he has benefited from their support. Yes, he dragged his feet and gave a tepid condemnation of white supremacists. Yes, that means he has failed as a leader.\n\nBut that doesn't mean he's an accomplice. That's not what accomplice means. And as much as I think nearly everything he says is moronic, taking away his Twitter account isn't really a great thing for the free exchange of ideas, which is still an important principle for the US. I hope.\n\n(On a side note, I'm fully expecting downvotes here, of course, because any time you don't enthusiastically go along with 100% of every anti-Trump statement, Reddit treats you as some kind of secret Trump sympathizer. The only acceptable behavior on here is to agree wholeheartedly with any and every anti-Trump statement, no matter how dumb.)"
"That's completely ridiculous.  He denounces it and it's not good enough.  Get fucking bent."
'Expect a torrent of abuse re. the AF Center. This will never end well. The threat of removing Twitter off Trump is akin to an opioid-riddled user having his meds removed.'
"Yay for internet censorship of opinions you disagree with.\n\nFor all the geniuses out there that say it's legal for them to do this, you're right. But where in their terms and services does it say that it's an offense worthy of a ban to have conservative views? And what precedent does that set? Conform to our liberal views or be silenced, pretty fascist of these companies. Google is already going down this route and it's pretty disturbing they're so willing to hold a company policy that is conform to our political beliefs or be silenced and terminated. Sad indeed.   "

The same country that has sophisticated weaponry and whole ass organizations that deal exclusively in locking up black people and profiteering off of racist policies. \n\nBut when push comes to shove, America doesn’t even keep the same energy that they use to victimize us with. Instead, she rolls over and takes the abuse because the abuser is white. \n\nThe world should observe first hand that this is what happens when you build your system on inequality and refuse to address it. It’s no surprise to us minorities here in the US that they’ve been locking innocent children in cages.

Going past fucking protesting, going past sit-ins, going past writing letters and calling our congressmen.\n\n\n They know we wont use our firearms, burn down government buildings, and put corrupt politicians in prisons. Why? Because everybody is too afraid to lose their jobs that pay too little and working 60+ hours per week so we can feed ourselves and our families. They know we are too afraid and would rather let Russia slowly insert itself into America. They know this because they have already began a soft insertion.

Anything is better than thumb sitting and waiting in the chains. '

"More telling than the congrats is that Trump didn't bring up:\n\n1) The Russians' use of banned chemical weapons on British soil\n\n2) Russian intrusions in US energy and infrastructure\n\n3) The legitimacy of Russia's elections.\n\nWhy do we have troops deployed overseas defending democracy if Trump won't even stand for it? Why is he so scared of Vlad?"
'What the fuck did he do to deserve congratulations from the president? He rigs the US election, poisons spies on allied soil last week, rigs the Russian election, then he gets a pat on the back from our president?  \n\nTrump talks more shit on people in his own fucking cabinet than he does on Putin. This shit is past the point of blatant.   \n\nYesterday I was walking to my car after work and someone drove past me in a pickup truck with a Trump yard sign and yelled “Trump or die BROOO!” The GOP base doesn’t give two shits that Trump is fellating Putin, because librul tears, right?'
"Man. If we're this pissed off, imagine how pissed professional national security people are. "

'When the history books are written, I think the writers are going to have a hard time stepping through all this shit without some attention being given to how FUCKING OBVIOUS IT WAS that Donald Trump is compromised. \n\nHow we, as a country, are not united on this is just mind boggling. Then I remember that there is a huge propaganda campaign that people... do not realize is a propaganda campaign. '
'As a Brit, I don’t find the fact that he congratulated Putin particularly problematic. I find the fact that he didn’t even *mention* the alleged use of nerve agents in British soil *very* problematic. '
"No one understands Trump wants to be Putin. Donnie wants the unlimited power, he wants no term limits and he damn well would love to be able to banish his opponents (Lock them up or even kill them). Listen to the insanity of putting to death drug dealers. It's like listening to Grandpa or Great Grandpa ranting on a fucking family get together. "
'The GOP is a joke. Trump is not fit to lead a western democracy. The right wing propaganda machine needs to go away. This shit gets worse every month. '
"He is so obviously Putin's puppet. EVERY SINGLE GOP congressman, including McCain and Flake who have never supported legislation to protect the public from Trump and/or provided empty criticisms, is to blame. When all the shoes drop, our country will be utterly shocked and debased. "
'President REEK '
"The fact that the chemical weapons terrorist attack wasn't mentioned greatly damages Nato.  Trump is destroying long standing alliances and strengthening Russia.\n\nTrump fully legitimizes Russia in this phone call.  Trump is a traitor and criminal of the highest order."
'Stupid people do stupid things. '
'I sometimes wonder if Trump, when not distracting himself with food and Fox, has trouble sleeping. Does he get what\'s happening? Does he understand his damage? Beyond the multiple working women, hookers and Playboy bunny allegations . . . beyond Cambridge Analytica . . . his constant firings of "the best people" . . . Russia . . . tax cuts have benefitted no one but 1% . . .jobs haven\'t come back ... stock market is falling ... opioids are killing us, physically and financially ... nothing  on guns .  . . trade tarrifs . . . Puerto Rico is still a goddamn mess ... net neutrality ...\n\nWhen he falls asleep every night, what goes through his head?  This guy who contribute d money to Hillary Clinton for years.\n\nHe\'s a product of an illegal immigrant. His German grandfather sneaked into America to follow the gold Rush. Opened whore houses. He avoided the war. The US sent him back to Germany but Germany didn\'t want him. \n\nTrump\'s lineage comes from a certified illegal immigrant. His own wife is of questionable status.\n\nHow the fuck does this guy and his followers sleep at night?\n\n'
'We are so fucked'
'So yeah why not congratulate the dictator that attacked and annexed another country and sending a spy to an Allie for a chemical attack. '
"I didn't even have to read the article first to know that his actions were followed by outrage from McCain, moderate disapproval from other republicans, and absolutely no action against the president by Congress whatsoever."
'I love the conservative going "well Obama congratulated him too!" as if trying to make this some non-issue\n\nObama was trying to reset relations with Russia, and Russia wasn\'t as publicly seen as a bad actor then.  Seeing as the crimean invasion was still a year or so off.  Meanwhile Trump congratulated him after the UK and our own government officials declared Russia attacked Britain with a nerve agent less than a month ago!\n\nPutin attacked our ally with a chemical weapon and Trump fucking congratulated him on winning re-election.\n\n\nTrump is seriously dead set on destroying relationships with our allies, and the Kremlin making it public was very much calculated for that effect.'

'Dudes a scumbag. He never should have been HHS Sec. to begin with. Price should be under investigation for insider trading.'
'President Trump should also resign for spending tens of millions of taxpayer dollars so that he, his family, members of his administration, and members of his Secret Service can spend countless weekends at his luxury resorts and high-rise hotels. \n\nPresident Trump even takes the abuse one step further than Price because in Trump\'s case he bills the government the "market rate" for accommodations that *he owns*. So he\'s effectively lining his own pockets with taxpayer money. Unbelievably swampy activity and a total abuse of power -- this motherfucker needs to be impeached faster than it took Price to resign/be fired.\n\n..and that means we need to elect a Democratic Congress in 2018, because the GOP have proven they won\'t do a damn thing about this horrible excuse for a presidency. '
'Remember, Trump publicly promised to fire this guy if the Obamacare repeal failed. The private flight shit is just convenient cover, IMO'
'Anybody think he was fired not because of the abuse of tax payer money, but because they failed again to repeal Obamacare and Trump found out he can’t fire Mitch?'
"It's so hard to keep track of Trump administration scandals that I was thinking this was  [U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/08/21/treasury-secretarys-wife-boasts-of-travel-on-government-plane-touts-hermes-and-valentino-fashion/?utm_term=.2a7f2c9aa5d4) getting fired for this issue but this is a different secretary getting fired for the same thing - the health and human services secretary.\n\n**So when does U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin 'resign' for this very issue?** I'm looking forward to that so people can tweet snarky stuff at his wife."
"THIS is what it takes? This isn't among the top ten abuses of power for this administration. This probably isn't even the top ten power abuses of this administration that we've learned about this WEEK. "
"conservative guy here: I was optimistic about this dude coming in but he turned out to be 1. grossly incompetent in trying to do anything about Obamacare and 2. uhh, hello, mother fucker, you can't gouge the taxpayer for your fuckin trips. Good riddance "
"Price's pricey private planes portray president's people poorly; populance properly pissed"
'No one can beat the speedrun time set by the MOOCH. '

'Fat lazy old man lies to entire nation who employs him.     '
"What is most strange about all of this.  That he is trying to deny golfing AT ALL.  Or at least his staff is.  He's been caught multiple times now doing it and yet they try to deny it. They could come out and say that he has a lot of meetings while he is golfing.  Like I have had more than one meeting like that in my life.  A 2 hour meeting that takes place over a round of golf.  But they don't even do that.  They just continue to insist that he never golfs.  That he is constantly working.  It is just crazy.  It is insulting to the American people even in a pretty direct way.  As though we are too stupid to understand what we are seeing.  "
"Good.  That's 7 less days for that idiot to fuck shit up.  \n\nFrankly, he can spend the rest of his days golfing.  The more time he spends on golf and business, the better off we are."
"Breaking News:  Man who has never worked a full day in his life continues to slack off like a lazy jerkoff.\n\nHe seriously doesn't have the energy to do this job.  He's just too old and brittle (due to his poor diet, lack of exercise, and possible drug use)."
"'Fake news. I don't like it so it's fake news.' - Trump supporters."
"At this point I'd rather the idiot stays on the golf course where the likelihood that he'll make major decisions due to boredom is much much lower "
'Irrespective of Trump, who is a nightmare, I have noticed as I have gotten older that these “big shot” business types have a bizarre opinion about what “work” is. Some of these dudes (and I’m talking about exclusively dudes here) think that if you go golfing with people you work with or party with people you work with or whatever, you’re “working.” My suspicion is that Trump has no idea what working hard is, but since he has no family or social life he has thought for years that just bumming around the office means he’s busting his ass. '
"He dug his own grave on this. It would be harder to give him shit for golfing so much if he wasn't a total hypocrite. That's what a lot of people seem to the miss: it's not the golfing *per se* that is the problem, it's the combination of saying he wouldn't have time to gold as president and consistently railing on Obama for golfing that is the problem."
'Shitty president aside, Trump is also a shitty father. How old is Baron these days? Ten? I bet Trump doesn’t know either. At least take the kid golfing, man. '
'Dear future historians: it really was this bad. In fact, it was worse. '
'I guarantee you this is what is going on.  Back when he had that joke of a physical prior to the election he lied about his weight when he said he weighed 236lbs.  The weight put him and "slightly overweight" rather than "damn close to obese".  Since taking office he has probably put on weight due to stress.  A guy like him who eats fast food has to be a stress eater.  So he has eaten more than normal with the amount of pressure on him and the stress of the russia investigation.  \n\nSince Trump is an optics guy and only cares how things look rather than what they are he is golfing as much as he possibly can and avoiding the press to keep him from being stressed out and eating.  This is all in an effort to lose weight prior to the upcoming physical on January 12th I believe.  A guy like him, if he commits, can actually lost 10-20 lbs in a matter of weeks if he is just starting a diet.\n\nHe is doing all that so he can still tip the scales as only being "overweight" like he was before when he lied about his weight.  If he steps on a scale and the public record says he is now obese the media will have a field day with it and it becomes another line of attack on him.'
'Trump is a lazy fat ass. When he gets back to ‘work’ he will just sit around watching tv all day.'
"How does it feel to have this fucking fool shame and ridicule your nation every time he opens his mouth?\n\nYou do realize he's unravelling 50 years of your reputation?"
'Trump is the least respected President in modern history. Where Obama exuded leadership, Trump oozes pure narcissism, greed, and incompetence. And as such, he doesn’t have many people he can trust in official capacities. Look at all the leaks from 2017 about him losing his temper, saying dumb shit, reaseaching pardoning his family, being called a moron or idiot, etc. You think *nothing* happened in Obama’s White House that didn’t raise an eyebrow? Of course not. But he was respected and represented our country as a world leader. Trump gets no such respect and, with Mueller inching closer by the minute, needs private places to conduct the most secret business and have the most secure of conversations. He didn’t golf for 7 straight days because he’s a lazy ass (well, he is that, too). He did it because he’s preparing for a shit storm.'
'How do the trumpbots explain this? Or is this fake news to them? '
'Because nothing he says matters and no one holds him accountable. He’s a useful idiot that the Republicans use to pass unpopular legislation that their donors love and when it becomes politically convenient they’ll turn on him and blame him for the disaster of GOP policies. '
"We live in a country where the president expects us to eat his shit words like big brother's. It's like watching a scammy magician that doesnt even hide his tricks but fools people anyway"

"I know this stuff is really serious to the survival of our country's democracy, but he's so stupid it's hard not to laugh."
'This moron always chooses the wrong thing to do. Every single time.'
'Donald Trump’s day so far:\n\n- Jeff Sessions flipped on Trump\n- Chuck Schumer tricked Trump\n- FBI Director screwed Trump\n- Melania isn’t screwing Trump\n- Mueller has Trump cornered\n- Trump will have to resign\n- Or he’ll go to prison\n- More bombshells coming'
"Contemporaneous notes and witnesses strike again! Trump can't help himself when it comes to doing stupid shit around career professionals."
'Just a reminder, Obama put Comey in charge. Obama held the record of putting the opposite party in high level positions. Comey who supported mccain over Obama. Comey who supported romeny over the guy who gave him his job.\n\nHilary was also investigated by comey, and never had a hissy fit that he was a republican. Obama didnt either despite the right were absolute racist pricks to him for 8 years.\n\n\nAnd to put a shiner on it, most of us here are progressives, and we complain less than trump despite mueller, is a republican, who was appointed by a trump appointee.. and yet its trump screaming bias.  SHows how fucked up this timeline is.\n\n '
'What the fuck? This idiot has no regard for our democracy, freedoms, or values. Especially values.'
'What an insecure, pathetic man. Must hurt to know the majority of voters said “fuck you” to him at the polls.'
"Trump is a Fox news President. He perfectly represents the modern day GOP. These people can go fuck themselves. I'm done with these fucking morons. I will ridicule the cultists whenever they bring up politics with their typical,  ignorant smugness. These fools still talk about Obama care death panels like it actually happened...\n\n Trump isn't the problem. He's just the fucking moron that American's thought would be a good choice for President. Fuck the GOP and their ignorant and cultist base for defending the indefensible."
'Neither Trump nor his blindly loyal sycophants in Cult45 *ever* acknowledge any circumstance in which Trump does wrong or acts inappropriately or unethically. So naturally it’s A-OK in their minds for  “loyalty over country” Trump to pressure a public official whose agency is involved in investigating the president to waive the constitutional (state and federal) right to cast a secret ballot. \n\nTrump has no use for ethics, transparency or the truth,  and neither do his acolytes,'
'What a douchebag'
'I hope that the first week of business, the next administration will fire every single Trump appointee (who can be fired).\n\nI\'d want them to leave the position vacant for fear of the continued damage these "loyal" appointees could do...'

'Wow. This is literally the story line of an episode of South Park. Cartmen hires butters to filter out any negative comments on social media, and butters eventually quits and has PTSD from reading all the bad stuff.'
'Probably because even racist frog blogs are starting to turn on him. '
'AHAHAhaHAHAHha  thank you, this headline brightened my day.\n\nNormally not a great fan of anyone aiding and abetting the Trump regime, but I feel this poor critter probably already has suffered enough. '
"We're fucked. He's going to be so cranky."
"Oh crap, who is going to keep the evils of the world away from our fragile president's ego."
'It was resign or get fired for coming up with nothing....'
'People are saying he had no material to work with, but there are legions of Russiabots! Legions. Hell, Trump retweeted one of them yesterday. '
"Reminds me of South Park when Butters is forced to curate everyone's social media feeds and remove anything that isn't positive. It was funny then but to think that someone actually had to do something similar is insane. Hopefully this person can find something less stressful that they enjoy."
"One strategy for getting rid of Trump has been to make the job so miserable for him that he resigns. This could be a watershed moment in that effort. If he doesn't have anyone to spoon-feed him flattering bullshit every day, how long can he really last? "
'This is actually a sinister story that should not be dumbed down.  It is too bad people jump on the more obvious funny part of this story and neglect the sinister part. This is not a "win" for the opposition, in fact quite the opposite.   He left for the same reason bannon did. Instead of being in the public eye getting paid shit; he will now be in (relative) private making giant stacks and inventing the positive bullshit stories for the trump administration. These folks will retain complete access and make more money and do unimaginably more damage. '
"We are so fucked. As it was stated on a recent episode of Pod Save America, that guy had the most important job in the White House.\n\nTrump's gonna be like that big baby in Spirited Away. He'll be all pissy and stomp around destroying shit, firing missiles at random countries around the world. \n\nI'm gonna go make some popcorn and put some sunglasses on so I can watch the ensuing nuclear war.

'Imagine if the Chinese had cheated to help elect Obama - and succeeded in getting him elected by a rather slim margin.\n\nNow, just imagine how the Republicans would have reacted every single day until the next election!  They would have been screaming at the top of their lungs - every single day - about how the election was stolen and how Obama was in illegitimate president.  Every single talking-point would have been slamming Obama and the Democrats.  The slander would have been nonstop.  All day, every day.\n\nSo ***why the fuck are the Democrats doing absolutely fucking none of that today?!!***'

'*Someone* is trying very hard lately to normalize Fox News here. Don\'t let them. Fox News is Republican Party propaganda, and is worse than places like ThinkProgress because unlike "biased" outlets on the left, Fox News spouts flat-out lies. They\'re Breitbart Lite (Licht?). Downvote anything from Fox regardless of content. When the news is important, as here, more reputable sources will carry it, and those sources should be the ones that appear here. Fuck Fox.  '
'And Trump still wants a completely private meeting with Putin.  WHY THE FUCK IS EVERYONE SO CALM?!'
"I'm sure as hell not reading this article, but coming from Fox, shouldn't this help people realize that the Republican congressman are batshit crazy?"
'>“As numerous intelligence and national security officials in the Trump administration have since unanimously re-affirmed, the ICA findings were accurate and on point," Warner said.  \n>  \n>But on the other side of Capitol Hill, Republicans on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence have disputed the\xa0 conclusion that Putin wanted to help Trump.  \n>  \n>GOP members of the House panel have cited "significant intelligence tradecraft failings" in the intelligence community\'s findings, saying it is inappropriate to conclude that Russia acted specifically to assist Trump.\n\nWell there we have it folks. I\'d almost agree with them (even though I disagree) if the whole, closed meeting with out any aides with Putin coming up. The whole demanding Putin be re-admitted to the G7 (G8), refusing to denounce the whole election manipulating thing from the start. Declaring the whole charade a witch hunt at every turn.

'Evil Nazi motherfucker.'
'Steven Miller is one horrible looking 32 year old. Maybe being really evil ages a person. Hope so.'
'From his wiki:\n\n>Duke University\'s former senior vice president, John Burness, told The News & Observer in February 2017 that, while at Duke, Miller "seemed to assume that if you were in disagreement with him, there was something malevolent or stupid about your thinking—incredibly intolerant."'
'Fake news. There is no way that dude is 32. '
'I thought this sub was for civil discussion? Nearly every comment I’ve read are just people calling this guy a scumbag. Doesn’t seem very civil to me..'

'Fuck T(ru)mp and fuck Stephen Himmler.'

"He's 32, but evil has aged him and he looks a solid decade older than he is."
'He has eyes like rotting sewage.\n\nEvery moment for him is a complete out of body experience, where his body is the human psyche. \n\nHe likely feels nothing from anything he does. No sorrow, no happiness, no remorse. All he needs to feel is above.\n\nHe has declared humanity trash and he wants to be King Rat.'
'It always seems like Trump has hired a horse of stupid villains and their sidekicks. '
'He looks like the dude that sneaks into frat houses and rapes women who are drunk sleeping and if they wake up he loses his erection immediately.'
'Still cannot believe these painfully insecure and obviously inadequate "master race" trolls still get influence and exposure. Look at this fucking twat; couldn\'t find his shriveled, laughable micro-penis with a microscope. Has serious abandonment issues when his hair-line decided to fuck off, somewhere towards the back of his head. His dead eyes and ineffectual voice make all this obviously racist "immigration reform" rhetoric look that much more pathetic. '
'Provided everything works out in the end and Donald and gang gets a taste of justice, there may be a silver lining in the Trump Era.  Some of the most vile, scheming, hateful cretins are being exposed for who they are.  Their masks are off.  Their actions will be well documented for future reminders of how to try to avoid this again.  Political chemo. Hurts now, but fight the cancer.\n\nSunlight can be the best disinfectant (and in all fairness sunlight can give skin cancer too....for the "both sides" crowd)'
"You know what really makes me mad? This guy is a fucking jew... I hate that jews are ok with this faux nationalism aka new nazi crap.\n\nThese are the same people whose parents, grandparents and great grandparents suffer through this crap.\n\nThey think they are so above this whole racism and prejudice but history has proved them wrong before and soon enough people are gonna turn against them... Again.\n\nAs a jew, I can't understand or even comprehend how other jews, be Ashkenazi, Sephardic, or bukharian can support or even be OK with this shit.\n\nNo one is above hate, eventually we all get thrown in the mix.

'President 1: "Lately, some players in the NFL have been choosing to take a knee during the national anthem, a time which I believe should be reserved to respect our service members,"…”as I\'ve said before, I believe that us honoring our flag and our anthem is part of what binds us together as a nation. But I also always try to remind folks that part of what makes this country special is that we respect people\'s rights to have a different opinion”…”The test of our fidelity to our Constitution, to freedom of speech, to our Bill of Rights, is not when it\'s easy, but when it\'s hard," …"We fight sometimes so that people can do things that we disagree with ... As long as they\'re doing it within the law, then we can voice our opinion objecting to it but it\'s also their right."…."I want (the protesters) to listen to the pain that that may cause somebody who, for example, had a spouse or a child who was killed in combat and why it hurts them to see somebody not standing,"…"But I also want people to think about the pain he may be expressing about somebody who\'s lost a loved one that they think was unfairly shot."\n\n\n\nPresident 2: “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’”…” “You know, some owner is going to do that.

"Sure are a lot of Trump apologists in here saying he never called white supremacists fine people. He did. Stop trying to change how downright assinine and shitty this doofus president is. \n\nSo the monuments brought together neo Nazis, white supremacists, bigots, and...fine people?  I don't give a fuck what the march or protest is about, the moment you look up and see swastikas, you're on the wrong side. Reschedule your protest and explicitly ban those kinds of people if that's not your thing. Don't grab a tiki torch and start chanting with them. \n\nNo fine people marched alongside white supremacists that day. It was all dirtbsg white supremacists.  There is no distinction. If you can't bring yourself to leave the protest once you see who has taken it over, you're a coward "

I thought George W was stupid and was embarrassed by him, but thought we were finally making progress in our national mindset with Obama. But now...I'm horrified.

'This is just fucked up. Trump doesn’t give a shit about spending taxpayer money, he ‘s just a toddler who can’t take criticism. Puerto Ricans were disappointed in the lack of response so they didn’t slob his knob as much as he expected.  Thus, he now decides they can just figure out shit or die after a major disaster. \n\nTo make matters worse, the Trump supporters I know now think Puerto Ricans are lazy ingrates. What the fuck is happening to this country??'
'Oh? But we got "flying to Indianapolis from Vegas in a government jet to go to a football game with a security entourage just to leave to make a stupid fucking point" money? but not "taking care of our citizens" money?\n\nJust checking'

"I live in the area of Bayamón, Puerto Rico. Two people have died of Weil's disease. My father who is suffering from dementia  and I had a very frustrating conversation with him about drinking the water. I tried my best to make him understand it might be poisoned but he just lashed out against me. I understand he's old and he's not processing this well. Then I wake up to this news about threatening to pull out FEMA because its a bit of a financial burden. I am seriously so sad and angered over this president. Lowest of the low. "
"It's been three weeks! Wtf is wrong with this man? FEMA is still in North Carolina a YEAR after Hurricane Mathew. And the damages from that were nothing compared to Maria. "
"So we don't have the money to help Puerto Rico, but we do have the money for Trump and co. to stay at the fancy hotel and golf course Trump owns every mother fucking weekend. Yeah that makes sense. Half the job of President is being constantly pampered.\n\nAs long as Trump is President this is going to keep happening. People said they wanted someone who wasn't a career politician as President. Well, guess what the fuck happens when disaster strikes and the guy in charges has effectively negative experience dealing with disasters. If you still support Trump you are a fucking piece of shit. And if that makes you mad, stop being such a crybaby PC obsessed snowflake pussy."
"Fucking disgusting. Didn't John Oliver do a segment on Puerto Rico stating that much of the pharmaceutical manufacturing left because of Congress? So it's not even Puerto Rico's fault they're in debt and I highly doubt they can borrow more money at this point. So Trump is just going to let them completely collapse? "
"Puertorican lady here currently living in Bayamon, PR...\n\nWhy do we have to be treated like dogs, when our people died for that flag, how is this even ok. I understand they cannot be here forever but why boast that in the middle of this humanitarian crisis, so many STILL no power, water, food, medicine... People have nothing, NOTHING. We have been paying FEMA for 20 yrs since Georges , PR paid the US 3.6 billion in 2016 even in the middle of the worst crisis ever... close to what vermont paid in 2016. Within that there's Fema. And its been like that since Georges.  This isn't a gesture of their heart, its our right as AMERICAN CITIZENS to have that help. Why splurge this in our faces when we have almost nothing. Why turn your back at others who have given everything to the USA, who have lost their lives in the name of the land of the free. I don't know how much I can take of how this person treats us, like we are dogs... how can they? How much can we take of the lack of compassion and empathy.\n\nIts so hard, so incredibly hard for so many people here, no news, no pictures or little videos can do any justice of the destruction this monster left, not adding the constant rains weve been getting... again dozens of areas flooded. its been overwhelming.\n Its crazy that Pence... PENCE seems more compassionate than this piece of orange dog turd. I dunno what to think anymore. We will keep working, keep helping our fellow man, keep our chin up and move forward, thats all we can do...\n\nEdit:  I wanted to mention that we do appreciate what people have one for us from the US, it seems some idiots say that we arent grateful which is a LIE. I was wrong in one part that we payed it in our working taxes, we do if we have federal jobs because we have thousands here that do have those, [but the payment comes from the federal taxes PR pays to the US, which FEMA is included.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/4/16385658/puerto-rico-taxes-hurricane).  I do appreciate what the volunteers and soldiers have done, and its because of those Puertorican soldiers and their families and those that live here have the right to get that help. Man, we only ask for compassion, no need to be complete asses when millions have little to eat, no water, no power, no medical services... compassion."

'90% of the territory is still without power too. Fuck Donald Trump. If he can’t act like a leader in this country’s time of need he should be removed. Abandoning fellow Americans in their time of need is abhorrent. He’s not a president, he’s a joke, a mindless oaf who accidentally stumbled into the Oval Office and squatted there. He doesn’t represent the US, he represents hate, self interest, and division. '

For example, only days ago on or about February 27, 2018, Mr. Trump\'s attorney Mr. Cohen surreptitiously initiated a bogus arbitration proceeding against Ms. Clifford in Los Angeles.  Remarkably, he did so without even providing Ms. Clifford with notice of the proceeding and basic due process.\n\n> 30) Put simply, considerable steps have been taken by Mr. Cohen in the last week to silence Ms. Clifford through the use of an improper and procedurally defective arbitration proceeding hidden from public view.  The extent of Mr. Trump\'s involvement in these efforts is presently unknown, but it strains credibility to conclude that Mr. Cohen is acting on his own accord without the express approval and knowledge of his client Mr. Trump.'

'It appears that Trump is implicated in the plea document, but not by name. \n  \nThe document reffers to the person telling Flynn what to do as a "senior" official on the transition team. Kushner perhaps. \n  \nIt later refers to someone else as a *very senior* member of the transition team. Flynn\'s boss\'s boss. And that person was at Mar a Lago when the documented conversation took place. \n  \nThat could very well mean Trump, and there is more than enough detail in the document to know if it\'s him they\'re talking about. That would mean that Flynn has gone on the record implicating Trump.\n  \nAt the very least, senior and very senior officials in the Trump transition team are directly implicated in the very serious crime of conducting their own foreign policy, independent of the White House.   \n  \nThis might really be the end. \n  \nEdit - It\'s being widely reported that the *very senior official* was Jared Kushner. \n\n  \n\n  '

'Recently, there was a book released in South Africa detailing our president’s corruption by a very credible journalist (he fiercely fought against Apartheid back in the day and even co-founded an anti-establishment newspaper). The worst thing about the book is the lack of reaction to it. Nothing has changed, even though this book ‘factually’ proves Jacob Zuma has robbed the country of more than a R100m ($7m) in taxes alone, regardless of the various corruption implications.\n\nPeople who distrust Zuma have more ammunition now, but people who support him wont read the book or will disbelieve it. Circle jerking about how awful someone is has gotten us nowhere. In our country, the majority of people share a past of apartheid oppression and a present of poverty. While the past motivates our voters heavily, I really hope our present can make even the most skeptical realize they deserve more. \n\nWhich brings me to my point: the audience determines the show. Try to make sure the important news, (the damning news?) is given to skeptics in a relatable way that actually effects change. \n\nFuck this is just awful advice.

"This article, is infuriating to me.  Basically it shows the same behavior that Trump exhibited with Comey regarding dropping the Flynn investigation, then got the whole obstruction of justice investigation started, and he's doing it again with the Senate Intel COmmittee and other Senators... and they all just blow it off not as the apparent obstruction being repeated, but that he's 'not familiar with politics' and protecting him. \n\nNot only does it show a repeated pattern, and the GOP brushed it off, it shows that Trump is also that corrupt, that stupid, and in a way shows he must have some sort of compulsive disorder or other mental issue preventing him from realizing how horrible this is to have done... that the Senate GOP does not work for him and is a separate branch. \n\n\n> Mr. Trump’s requests of lawmakers to end the Senate investigation came during a period in the summer when the president was particularly consumed with Russia and openly raging at his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions, for recusing himself from any inquiries into Russian meddling in the election. Mr. Trump often vented to his own aides and even declared his innocence to virtual strangers he came across on his New Jersey golf course.\n> \n> In this same period, the president complained frequently to Mr. McConnell about not doing enough to bring the investigation to an end, a Republican official close to the leader said.\n> \n> Republicans played down Mr. Trump’s appeals, describing them as the actions of a political newcomer unfamiliar with what is appropriate presidential conduct.\n\n......\n> \n> Mr. Burr said he did not feel pressured by the president’s appeal, portraying it as the action of someone who has “never been in government.” But he acknowledged other members of his committee have had similar discussions with Mr. Trump. “Everybody has promptly shared any conversations that they’ve had,” Mr. Burr said.\n\n........\n\n> Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, said on Thursday that the president had not acted improperly. Mr. Trump, he said, “at no point has attempted to apply undue influence on committee members’’ and believes “there is no evidence of collusion and these investigations must come to a fair and appropriate completion.’’\n\n.......\n\n> Mr. Trump also called other lawmakers over the summer with requests that they push Mr. Burr to finish the inquiry, according to a Republican senator who requested anonymity to discuss his contact with the president.\n> \n> This senator, who was alarmed upon hearing word of the president’s pleas, said Mr. Trump’s request to the other senators was clear: They should urge Mr. Burr to bring the Russia investigation to a close. The senator declined to reveal which colleagues Mr. Trump had contacted with the request.\n\n......\n\n> Another Republican senator said Mr. Trump had not urged him to help bring the Russia inquiry to a halt. Instead, the senator said, the president nudged him to begin an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s connection with the intelligence-gathering firm Fusion GPS, which produced a dossier of allegations about Mr. Trump’s ties to Moscow.\n\n.......\n\n"
'The "he doesn\'t know what he\'s doing"/"he\'s new at this" defence is so maddeningly stupid and offensive.\n\nSlightly off-topic, but I hate the way NYT articles always minimizes the scope of Mueller\'s investigation. This is dangerous in the (not unlikely) scenario that Mueller tries to prosecute Trump/Russia shit that isn\'t related directly to election activities.\n\nThe article writes\n\n> Robert S. Mueller III, the Justice Department’s special counsel who is leading a separate investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, is also examining whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct justice when he fired James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director who was running a federal inquiry into the matter.\n\nBut that\'s just part of it. The scope of Mueller\'s investigation is much bigger, [set out plainly in the one page document that empowers him](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/17/us/politics/document-Robert-Mueller-Special-Counsel-Russia.html), and includes but is not limited to:\n\n* Any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign.\n\n* any matters that arise from the investigation\n\n* federal crimes arising from the investigation \n\nMueller\'s job is much bigger than whether Trump directed the release of hacked emails and/or obstructed Russia investigation in firing Comey (the latter he\'s admitted to btw).'

'Oh shit the GOP Senate basically just cluster-bomb-shelled Trump with evidence of obstruction of justice:\n\n-\n\n* Senator Richard Burr, Chairman Senate Intel; on the record with NYT\n    * *“It was something along the lines of, ‘I hope you can conclude this as quickly as possible,’*\n        * Mr. Burr told other senators that Mr. Trump had stressed that it was time to “**move on**” from the Russia issue, using that language repeatedly, according to people who spoke with Mr. Burr over the summer. \n        * One Republican close to Mr. Burr, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Mr. Trump had been “**very forceful.**”\n    * Other members of his <Senate Intel>committee have had similar discussions with Mr. Trump. \n        * *“Everybody has promptly shared any conversations that they’ve had”*\n\n-\n\n* Senator Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Leader\n    * *"The president complained frequently to Mr. McConnell about not doing enough to bring the investigation to an end"*\n    * Mr. Trump voiced sharp anger that congressional Republicans were not helping lift the cloud of suspicion over Russia, the senators <McConnell & Corker> told political allies\n\n-\n\n* Senator Roy Blunt, Senate Intel member\n\n    * lobbied by Trump to “*to wrap up this investigation*” while about AF1 in Aug\n\n-\n\n* Senator Bob Corker, Chairman Senate Foreign Relations Committee\n    * Mr. Trump voiced sharp anger that congressional Republicans were not helping lift the cloud of suspicion over Russia, the senators <McConnell & Corker> told political allies\n\n-\n\n* Anonymous Republican Senator\n    * This senator, who was alarmed upon hearing word of the president’s pleas, said Mr. Trump’s request to the other **senators** was clear: *They should urge Mr. Burr to bring the Russia investigation to a close.*\n\n-\n\nAnd on top of all this, more insight into Trump\'s state of mind:\n\n-\n\n> Mr. Trump made several calls to senators without senior staff present, according to one West Wing official. According to senators and other Republicans familiar with the conversations, Mr. Trump would begin the talks on a different topic but eventually drift toward the Russia investigation.\n\n-\n\n> Mr. Trump’s requests of lawmakers to end the Senate investigation came during a period in the summer when the president was particularly consumed with Russia and openly raging at his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions, for recusing himself from any inquiries into Russian meddling in the election. Mr. Trump often vented to his own aides and even declared his innocence to virtual strangers he came across on his New Jersey golf course.\n\n-\n\n> Another Republican senator said Mr. Trump had not urged him to help bring the Russia inquiry to a halt. Instead, the senator said, the president nudged him to begin an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s connection with the intelligence-gathering firm Fusion GPS, which produced a dossier of allegations about Mr. Trump’s ties to Moscow.'
'>In conversations with Mr. McConnell and Senator Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Trump voiced sharp anger that congressional Republicans were not helping lift the cloud of suspicion over Russia, the senators told political allies. The Times\xa0reported in Augustthat the president had complained to Mr. McConnell that he was failing to shield Mr. Trump from an ongoing Senate inquiry.\n\nHmmmmmmmmmmmmm'
'>Republicans played down Mr. Trump’s appeals, describing them as the actions of a political newcomer unfamiliar with what is appropriate presidential conduct.\n\nThis is not a valid excuse. Get the fuck outta here. Imagine hearing that from your doctor.\n\n"Sorry for giving you the wrong blood type. I am a medical newcomer that is unfamiliar with proper medical conduct. So if you die it\'s really not my fault".'
"Trump is a criminal and *gasp* a lying sack of shit.  God fucking damn you GOP.  Obama couldn't pick his fucking nose without you pieces of shit giving him hell for it.\n\nFuck the GOP and fuck this GODDAMN abomination of an administration."
"Oh I'm sorry, he just didn't know you weren't supposed to collude with Russia.  He has no campaign experience. \n\nHe didn't know you weren't supposed to profit off the Presidency, he's a businessman you know.\n\nHe didn't know you weren't supposed to fire the director of the FBI, threaten the special prosecutor, or pressure Congress to drop investigations of himself. He has no experience in govt you know. \n\nPathetic! "
"Lost in all this is the commonly accepted fact that the Russians were working like hell to get Trump elected.  You can say there isn't any proof of collusion.  You can say their influence didn't actually sway the outcome.  But it's incredibly concerning that our largest adversary really, really wanted Trump to win.  I don't think they had pee pee tape leverage on him, but I do think they felt that his Presidency would severely undermine our internal stability and our leadership position internationally.  Tip of the cap, they nailed it."
'I just have a sick feeling that our Republican legislature will excuse literally anything that Trump does.  I worry that there is no coming back from this.  What can even be done at this point?'
">Mr. Burr said he did not feel pressured by the president’s appeal, portraying it as the action of someone who has “never been in government.” \n\nThis. is. horseshit. \n\nIt's not an excuse, god damn it! He plays dumb on purpose. And he has advisors and lawyers all over the place! And _especially_ not after they whined and moaned about Obama not having enough experience!"
"Lots of people keep saying Republicans aren't doing anything about this crap because they just want their tax cuts.  I don't get it.  They don't need Trump to pass their shitty bill.  President Pence would certainly sign their shitty bill.  President Ryan would sign their shitty bill.  President Hatch would sign their shitty bill. Presidents Tillerson, Mnuchin, Mattis, and Sessions would all sign off on this shitty bill. Hell, the entire friggin' line of succession is full of Republican money grabbers.  They have absolutely nothing to lose and everything to gain.  I just don't get it.  Get that fucker out of the office NOW, and even if Republicans are worried about pissing off their Trump-lovin' constituents, they've got a full year to get over it before the next election.  "
'The fucker is guilty as shit.'
'"Mr. Trump’s requests were a highly unusual intervention from a president into a legislative inquiry involving his family and close aides."\n\n"Unusual." "Unprecedented."

If the next line doesn\'t state the exact definition of Obstruction of Justice and emphasize how flagrantly he\'s breaking the law, the media is failing you. \n\n'
"So there's basically no way Trump didn't straight-up order Sessions to stop Mueller. Hmm.\n\nThe really fun part here is that now every Republican on the Intel and Senate Judiciary committees is going to have to be questioned by the FBI. Hope they're all truthful!\n\nAnd why is this leaking now? A hint that Congress is finally gearing up to throw Trump overboard? There were a lot of hints early on that the GOP was desperate to do taxes, and once they did that, they'd turn on Trump. (Which never made sense to me, cause Pence would be even easier at this. Could they really be stupid enough think they could blame this unpopular bill on Trump?) But given the tax bill, the timing of this leak seems really suspicious. "
'What bothers me the most, President Obama never asked Congress to stop investigations and more investigation on Clinton. And all this investigation has led to nothing legal on Hillary. But Trump wants to stop all investigation on Russia? Why? That is the biggest question. \n\n\n'

'They harassed (and continue to do so) Hillary over fake Benghazi and emails (she was cleared for both), and this crying snowflake wants "to move on pleeeease."\n\nYeah, we\'ll gladly move on to the "arrest and jail Trump" phase. Sure thing!'
'I fear that Mueller will uncover direct collusion but Trump will call it fake news, his base will believe him, and the Republicans in Congress will do nothing because they want to get reelected.'

Trump is being sued in Maryland and Washington, D.C., for violating the “emoluments clause” of the U.S. Constitution by running his Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.; Paul J. Manafort, the second Trump campaign manager, has been indicted on money laundering charges; Trump’s first national security advisor, Michael Flynn, has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in an investigation that also uncovered secret lobbying work for the Turkish government; and his son-in-law Jared Kushner failed to disclose $1 billion in loans tied to his real-estate company, and has repeatedly had to revise his financial disclosure forms to add items he “forgot.”\n\nSo much swamp draining going on...'

"I'm a believer. Never in my almost 60 years have I witnessed a more corrupt group of mostly old white rich men so brazenly attack the American people and work so hard to deplete any benefits and in full view possibly pull off the largest heist in American history that could end democracy as we've know it. Never.\n\nI didn't even think it was constitutionally possible but now I am fully aware there are no tools to stop it until the pedo party decides he's too much risk. Further I knew there were problems but never imagined this country could vote such a total loser into the highest office. Everything I was taught I now know is utter bullshit and the whole bloody thing is a sham.\n\nIf Americans truly understood how bad things are the streets would be packed, businesses shut down and not a dime spent."
"What people *believe* isn't really the point. The Trump administration *is* the most corrupt and treasonous government the US has had. Objectively.\n\nAdd up all the nepotism, all the profiteering, all the purposeful destruction of good government institutions, the coddling of Nazis and other racists, and of course all the collusion with Russia that enabled them in the first place, and what administration was worse? \n\nNone. It's not even close. And they're not done yet. They want a war with North Korea. There is no need for a war with North Korea, but Trump *wants* a nuclear war because it's the only thing he can imagine that would get people to support him and ease up on the investigations.\n\nThis administration is going to be the subject of a fat, hideous, humiliating chapter in all US history books from now on. That gang may never do actual perp walks, because abundant pardoning will be part of the corruption, and the rest will die of old age before they can be convicted, but they'll all be figuratively perp-walked through American history from now until they stop writing American histories. After they're done hating him and mourning all the damage he has done, people will laugh at Trump from now until forever. \n\nAnd everyone who supports him? They'll be scorned and mocked in history like the people who defended slavery or the Nazis or Stalin. "

"Cue the silent Republican reactions, while Democrats speak up.\n\nI think the worst part that's gone unaddressed is that Republicans sit silently not saying anything at all, and nobody really calls them on it.

Can you tell me what it was like when Donald Trump was President?"\n\nAnd I\'ll answer "Well, sweetie, he was the dumbest fucking moron to ever exist and the fact that he rose to the highest nation in our land is an affront to democracy and a stain on American history rivaled only by systemic racism that treated African Americans horribly during the civil rights movement, Japanese internment camps, systemic sexism that treated women like second class citizens, slavery and every season of Keping up with the kardashians."'
"If the Republicans got their version of the memo public, then the Democrats should have theirs too. I am a Trump supporter who would like to think that we should hear both sides of the story.  Downvote me all you want, but if the GOP got their version of this shit show published, then so should the DNC, regardless of what it says. The fact that both sides of this shit show aren't being published makes me worried."
'The obvious corollary here is that if the Nunes memo was released and it ended up being a nothing burger, then keeping the Democrat’s memo classified means it is seriously damaging to Trump.  \n'

"The GOP facade is starting to crack.\n\nEven though Corker is headed out, a senator taking a public shot at a president in his own party is a big deal.\n\nAs more people stop fearing Trump, you can expect this kind of unvarnished criticism to become more frequent.  Just because Republican leaders have kept their mouths shut doesn't mean that they're blind to the chaos surrounding the Trump admin."
"It's worse than that.

"Yet another example of Donald verbally attacking a lawmaker in his own party for petty reasons.  \n\nNot only is this not how a president should act, it's also not how a vaguely competent leader at any level should act.  Corker is supposedly on the same team.  Only a shit leader would attack someone on his own team."
'I do love when racist GOP assholes start attacking each other.  Gives me hope that this house of cards will come crumbling down before they do too much damage to the country.  '
"Probably an unpopular opinion but I think the media should quit covering these ridiculous Twitter fights. Trump continues to do it because he gets attention for it. We all know Sen Corker hates Trump, and has more integrity in his pinky than Trump and his whole family have. There is no point giving him more attention.\n\nWe have bigger problems. The guy is about to start a war with NK, and is under investigation for stealing an election. Who cares what kind of garbage he tweets while he's on the shitter in the morning. He doesn't know what he's doing, he's just reacting."
"More GOP rats are fleeing the sinking ship. The Dotard will forever be relegated to The Dumpster of history's worst leaders.\n\nI wonder if Donnie realizes yet just how fucked he is.\n"
"It should just be so obvious to everybody in the world that Trump is blatantly lying here. Corker announced he wouldn't be running for re-election *in September* and as another user greatly pointed out, his margin of victory from his last election is higher than Trump's approval rating. The idea that he begged for Trump's endorsement is just so divorced from reality, in what possible scenario could he need it? It's fucking Tennessee we're talking about.\n\nThe lies are obvious and they in turn make it clear that he's a *pathological* liar. That's not just a word of emphasis thrown in front of liar, it means he literally can't stop himself from lying about even the most mundane things, even when it gives him little to no benefit and can really come back to bite him in the ass. This is how somebody with a genuine mental illness acts. Other world leaders pay attention to this."
'Its fucking insanity when the swamp thing ceo from exxon is the grounding and logical voice of reason. What. The. Fuck.'

"Times are bad and the Trump situation gets me depressed so often.\n\nBut this headline made me smile like I haven't smiled in months!  \n\nThank you Corker!"
"Why does the President think it's a good idea to antagonize a Republican senator when they have such a slim majority in the senate? I get that Corker is leaving, but he'll still be a Senator for more than a year, right? Trump needs all of the Senate Republicans on his side to pass his agenda; we've seen that on healthcare. \n\nSo why shit on Corker? \n\nI just don't understand Trump at all, you guys."

Corker told him he could be of more assistance in other areas of govt. Corker was interested in being Sec. of State but really wanted Sec. of the Treasury. Trump is still pissed Corker rejected him.'
"The fact that Corker, who got elected Sen. by running a heavily racist ad, is the voice of reason is something I just can't get over. For him to call out this White House as much as he has says everything. This administration is out of control. "
"So even republicans now are calling him rightfully a moron but yet he still has nuke codes and isn't impeached?  What is wrong with this country. Who is keeping this racists asshat in power? Do we need a military coo?  I'm up for anything at this point.  The damage this administration causes to the world every day makes it imperative we FIRE the entire White House Staff."
"I don't know how Senator Corker even walks with those short legs and YUUUUUGE balls. \n\nI really hope one day, after he gives his very last fuck, Corker walks into the Oval Office and removes Andrew Jackson's portrait to somewhere worthy. I think he earned that right, and responsibility, today. \n\nRacists are a dime a dozen, Jackson was also a world-class badass who could kill every last Trump and most of his cabinet with a plastic spork. I HATE that Trump tries to glom onto that epic legacy with those soft, pudgy little hands. Regardless, Senator Corker did Tennessee proud today. "

Do you think he really believes he had the largest inauguration crowd in history, signed the largest tax cut bill in history and has passed more legislation than any other president?\n\nI've gotten to the point where I honestly wonder if he really believes these things.  Either believing them or lying about such easily verifiable things is just as bad.  The latter is indicative of thorough and habitual dishonesty and the former is some form of deep rooted insanity.  But I've really grown to wonder which is the case."
"Doesn't even know what the FUCK he's signing."

"Not a lot of people are mentioning this, but this isn't just a mentally slipping former game show host/slimy businessman who is telling a person that they can't publish a book...this is the Executive Branch of the United States government making this demand -- this is a first amendment issue.  It should be a much bigger deal -- the Executive Branch of the United States is demanding a book not be published, and is threatening civil action if it is published.  \n\nThat's a first amendment violation that shouldn't stand...it's not just a funny, laughable moment, but a genuine threat to our values as a democratic nation."

"This is actually so brilliantly simple a strategy that I'm shocked that I've never heard it mentioned before now. A public court proceeding will ensure that *all* the information about *everything* that was done to steal the 2016 election will be presented in as clear and thorough a manner as possible, with the no-doubt many shocking revelations stretched out over so long a period and explained in such detail that virtually no American will be able to avoid hearing about them. Even the staunchest Trump-supporting idiot could be pummelled into understanding by the relentless barrage of logic and rational explanation.\n\nMost important of all, the conspiracy will be laid out in as *apolitical* a forum as exists in America today. This may well be the DNC's grand scheme to prevent as much right-wing violence and terrorism as possible when Trump is inevitably revealed and deposed as a traitor. As such, this is the most sensibly patriotic thing that any group of Americans has done since 1945. The rest of the world wishes them good fortune in the courtroom wars to come, and I hope they infuriate the Russians to the utmost by eliminating the possibility of violence in every aspect and every stage of these wars. And may they motivate the Russians to get rid of their own petty, slimy ruler in whatever manner they see fit. "

'God damn it, is the president of the US going to start tweeting shit about a literal little old lady.'
'>Donald Trump\'s planned state visit to the UK has been **downgraded** to a "working visit", likely forming part of a multi-country tour, it has been reported.\n\n>**It means the billionaire will not be a guest of the Queen**, as was previously envisaged.\n\n>Theresa May\'s offer of a state visit to the first-term President was greeted with the threat of mass protests by opponents.\n\n>**Mr Trump\'s visit will now take place without the glitz and pomp of a full state visit**, the Evening Standard reported.\n\n>A state visit was also opposed by London mayor Sadiq Khan, who said he was "not sure it is appropriate for our government to roll out the red carpet" for Mr Trump.\n\n>Hundreds of thousands of people had signed a petition against the plan.\n\n>**During the summer, the White House denied reports that Mr Trump wanted to delay his visit until he could be sure of a better reception**, following a phone call with Theresa May.\n\n>The President\'s spokesman said: "The subject never came up."\n\n>At the time, Downing Street maintained there had been "no change" to plans for a state visit.'
'I\'m reminded of the time when [the British House of Commons debated whether or not Donald should be honored with a state visit.](https://www.c-span.org/video/?424195-1/british-house-commons-debates-president-trumps-state-visit)  Some of the best verbal smackdowns I\'ve heard against our president were from this debate.\n\n> It\'s extraordinary that Trump, from the cavernous depths of his scientific ignorance, is prepared to challenge the conclusions of 97% of the world experts on [climate change].\n\n- Paul Flynn\n\nAlso from Flynn:\n\n> It\'s on the nuclear issue, he\'s again *almost unique* in that he believes in nuclear proliferation and he\'s trying to persuade countries like South Korea and Japan to acquire their own nuclear weapons.  We *know* that the danger of nuclear war is not because of the malice of nations, but the likelihood that it will come by accident, by human error, by technical failure, like when one of our missiles headed in the wrong direction, towards the United States, during a test.  \n\n> The more nations that have nuclear weapons, the more likely it is that this will occur.\n\nThat shit is terrifying.  \n\nBritish MPs were concerned about how dangerously idiotic Donald was back in February.  I wonder what they think about him now that he\'s used terms like "fire and fury" when talking about the US response to North Korean threats, and how he\'s treating possible nuclear war like a reality TV show cliffhanger.'

She put up with him and his awful attitude. \n\nIf she won't deal with Trump that really shows her low opinion of him."
"Not to mention having to meet a Muslim mayor when he gets to London. \n\nTrump has had more chances to succeed than almost any other human on earth. He tries to found companies - fails. Gets bailed out by dad. Does that again multiple times, fails. Tries to found a university - fails. Tries to own an NFL team, fails. It's like he's so unaware of his success to fail ratio, and that scares me. He is, overwhelmingly, a failure. And continues to be over and over again."

'"UN is a shithole country, too. Calling me racist, they am not smart."'
"It is not ever nice to hear another country described as a shithole.  Even with a show like 'Amazing Race', the couple that had actually been to a country where it had been challenging, would have been slammed afterwards for calling it a 'shithole'.\n\nIt seems bizarre that he randomly chose Norway as a counter-example.  I am not aware of any move among Norwegians to move to the US since Trump became President.  Despite what all those Scandanavian noir and crime fiction might mislead you to believe, Scandinavian countries have relatively low incidence of murder and violent crime.  Moreover commerce has flourished - eg Ericcson, Nokia, Volvo, H&M etc, without having to disparage or disregard low-income workers when it comes to health care especially. \n"

"This article refers to an un-named human rights official who works for the UN. This is not equivalent to the UN calling his comment racist.

"Those are Nationalist comments... Not racist ones. And he called the countries shitholes. Not the people. It's two very different things. \n\nIt's a shitty thing to say but not racist.

'My maternal ancestors immigrated to the US about 100-130 years ago from Sweden. At the time, the country was suffering from a fairly severe economic depression. It was as the "President" would call it (if it wasn\'t for the White people living there) a "shit hole".\n\nTen of thousands of immigrants from Ireland, Italy, Poland, Germany, Sweden, etc came to America because they were seeking escape from the hardship in their own land. It is a heartbreaking necessity for some people to have to leave the land their family has lived in for several hundreds of years. It required bravery, and sacrifice.\n\nAnd it is exactly what people are doing now. They come to America for the opportunity here. Maybe their country is in a lot of trouble from war, poverty, disease, crime, corruption... but that is why they are coming here in the first place!\n\nSo to just write them all off as coming from a "shit hole", and saying we should only take European immigrants is *extremely* racist. And it is profoundly inappropriate for a President to say, or in fact to even think. I don\'t want a President to even think like that.\n\nTrump is a prolapsed colon.'
'Hi from a "shithole country" Mr. Trump. I apologise for the way our countries are; after people like you (rich megalomaniacs with God complexes) raped and pillaged our country, didn\'t do much to help during our independence, running neo-colonial organisations that are legally not slavery but still make you billions of dollars, we can only admit that you are clearly are in the right here. We should not come to your country because we deserve to live in shitholes. /s\n\nHonestly fuck this guy. It\'s a wonder why I\'m seeing more an more Africans preferring help from Chinese rather than you guys. There\'s an underlying racism that\'s undeniable in this guy and this furthers the view that America doesn\'t give a shit about Africa. '
"Trump is a fucking national embarrassment with this continued daily regurgitation of mean-spirited blathering.  Actually, at this point I'm ashamed to count him as a member of the human race."
'How is that racist? They are shitholes.'
'As an American, I am so ashamed to be associated with this guy'
'Definitely the worst president we\'ve ever had. I\'m ashamed to call myself American. \n\nTo anyone on this site from these countries, please know that there are millions of American citizens that oppose this monster, and we do not and never will consider your country a "shithole". I wish I could say all Americans do, but that\'s pretty obviously not the case. :( \n\nI also wish there was a time machine so we can go back and stop this train wreck from ever happening, but sadly we just have to live through it and warn future generations what can happen when we put a racist, rich idiot in the White House. '
'Top comment in this thread: "Meltdown in 3.2.1.... Get your popcorn ready."\n\nThe extreme left still thinks their constant allegations of "racism" are powerful weapons. They just don\'t get it. Even after all this time. Trump doesn\'t care if you call him racist. He may fight back because he isn\'t afraid to stand up for himself (or for America). But he also knows he\'s not racist and he knows the repetitive allegations are purely political. Don\'t agree with the extreme left? RACIST! It\'s getting old friends.\n\nThe objective truth is that some of these south and central american countries are straight-up shitholes. I don\'t know how anyone can deny that. Policemen hang from highway overpasses in Juarez because they took action against the wrong cartel. And you\'re going to try to tell me that\'s not a shithole country? \n\nThe extreme left\'s problem is they spend so much time trying to control images and frame reality that they start to lose their grip on what the objective truth really is. Sad.\n\nSPEZ: https://i.redd.it/9ibft8pram901.jpg'
'trump supporters are lost, I tried talking with one directly the other day. Absolute black hole. trump can do no wrong, and anything he says is gospel to them. So his base will be his base for good. However the rest of us who have cognitive thought need to do something about this. Time to call your congressmen and senators again, the president is not a dictator (yet) we still have some power to limit him or stop him completely. Be we need to get the house and senate behind us. Turns out I was wrong in a statement I said a few months back. We have 2 more chances to get rid of this clown\n\n* Mueller Time\n\n* Blue wave Mid-terms 2018\n\nYou know what to do. '
'I’ve usually held Trump to the “standard” that he’s the level of racist that anyone in their 70’s who was insulated from consequences all their life might be, and this shows the same pattern.\n\n'
'Everyone keep talking about it and reporting it. That’s the only way that will prevent it from going away. We need this #1 shithole gone already. He’s the worst thing to ever happen to this country after 9/11.'

">You cannot dismiss entire countries and continents as 's***holes',\n\nI think people who don't see an issue with this think that if these countries were to just disappear off the face of the Earth that there would be zero impact felt because after all they're a shit hole, worthless. \n\nEven though the US trades with these countries, and benefits off of the resources found there like gold, oil, diamond, spices etc. Not to mention that these people are humans like anyone else from anywhere. They have culture - music, food, languages, tradition etc. To just discard all of that and simply brand them as shit is just ... I have no words.\n\nI think anyone who feels this way needs to travel more and get more exposure to people from different walks of life"

"Has Trump changed, even a little, since the day he was carried down his golden escalator?  Seriously, he's the same guy, same conman, just worse as a function a time and power granted.  He will be the same tomorrow, a week from now, a month, a year, if left in power.  The time to stand up was during the primary, during the general election, at the electoral college, after he wouldn't divest his assets and instead opted to violate the Constitution every day, after he fired Comey, after he invited the Russians into the oval office and offered up national secrets, et al.  But, as long as 'standing up to' means 'removing from power', welcome aboard the impeachment express."
'Thread is obviously getting brigaded.  \n\nRex Tillerson called Trump a "fucking moron".  Yes, his Secretary of State. \n\nGWB and Obama just gave scathing speeches about his mental capacity. \n\nBob Corker says he is a manchild that needs babysitting. \n\nJeff Flake  "Mr President, I rise to say enough.  It is my duty and in my honor to speak out" and said he is "reckless, outrageous and unhinged. \n\nTrump is an incompetent, moronic con man that was able to exploit the utterly stupid part of our country. \n\nEdit - spelling'
"What exactly is there to stand up to?  Compared to the massive corruption of selling 20% your country's uranium production and the mishandling of incredibly sensitive national secrets all Trump has done is act rudely.  \n\nThis is the reason he will win reelection.  Down vote all you Clintonistas want, but what you see only bothers those that live on the two narrow coastal areas of this country.  Grow up.

"I'm glad these senators are speaking up, but I fear that since none of them are seeking re-election it could pave the way for people much more in line with Trump's ideology to take their place. That scares me. "
'No, Its been the time since before he was elected. We should of stopped him while he was causing problems before his presidency, and we should still stop him now. '
"While I appreciate the repubs are finally growing a spine and acknowledging that trump's admin is a train wreck of collusion, fraud, lies, subterfuge, indecency and hatred. I can't help but be even more disappointed for several reasons.\n1. being the fact half of the country spoke out against trump long before he got elected and KNEW a trump presidency would cause a upheaval of western society (we've essentially been put into a ideological civil war, even here in Canada, nationalism has grown due to trump's evil) and these guys voted for him. THEY CAUSED THIS and now they're being praised for doing the bare minimum? disgusting.\n2. The only god damned reason these republicans senators and GOP members are speaking out now is because it just dawned on them that THEY WILL NOT GET THEIR TAX CUTS. THAT IS THE ONLY REASON. I refuse to believe that the party of bigotry, hatred, discrimination, right wing corporatism and oligarchs suddenly grew a conscience. Make no mistake, if trump had gotten their tax cuts, he could have done much worse than he's already done and they wouldn't say  DAMN THING. It's all about money, its ALWAYS about money.\n\nIf these right-wingers truly and genuinely cared for the country and decency, trump would have never happened. "

'Right-wing media has turned the GOP into batshit crazy instead of just corrupt af for their corporate masters. Trump is nothing but a typical fox news viewer who became President.

You keep saying that religion has a higher place in our government than intellectualism or actual morality?\n\nWell then you get the culmination of those ideas.\n\nThis isn't from what the party believes at its core.

Unfortunately you can't unwind the stupidity that Republicans have drilled into the country."
"You know what the DNC should do?\n\nThey should pay a former foreign spy to make up stuff and put it in a file, then try to fancy it up by calling it a 'dossier'\n\nThen Obama, Lynch, Comey, and John Brennan can use that to get a FISA warrant to spy on his campaign. They could even unmask him and then leak details of calls to the media. And even if they lose the election they're trying to rig they could try to make up some charges based on anything they find with the FISA warrant, and if he points out the fraud they can try to say he's obstructing 'justice'.

I don't know where the GOP's anonymous operatives were these past 2.5 years, but they should have been in his face *immediately* following that press conference. If he made another move towards running he should have been awakened by the flash of a camera bulb, and next to a Jane Doe corpse borrowed from the morgue.\n\nThose assholes let this psychotic shit-flinging orangutan bully himself into the nomination, then the White House, and there's no going back. \n\nThis is why Flake *has* to run again. \n\nHe can tank the election if he wants to and allow his Democrat opponent to win, but he SHOULD NOT step out of the way of some lunatic fringe candidate who declares loyalty to Trump, agrees with the likes of Roy Moore, becomes a puppet of Bannon, and gives further legitimacy to Alex fucking Jones.\n\nI get the urge to quit, but now is **not** the time. Flake and his party fucked us royally, and they HAVE to fix this shit -- and they can start by drawing up articles of impeachment on ANYTHING THEY CAN MAKE STICK. I know Russia seems like a slam dunk, but they don't need it; the 25th gives *wide* latitude to remove a president from office. It sets a risky precedent, but Republicans have to bear the responsibility for righting this egregious wrong."
'The [NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/18/us/politics/steve-bannon-trump-white-house.html) has an interesting taking on this-\n\n> As of Friday morning, the two men were still discussing Mr. Bannon’s future, the officials said. A person close to Mr. Bannon insisted the parting of ways was his idea, and that he had submitted his resignation to the president on Aug. 7, to be announced at the start of this week, but it was delayed in the wake of the racial unrest in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nI don\'t actually believe this is true, but it seems like a decent way to let Bannon "save face". The administration has to be scared shitless of the damage Bannon can do to their base if he\'s on the outside and pissed off about it.\n\nUpdate (11:01): \n\nFrom [The Daily Beast](http://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-wanted-steve-bannon-gone-now-bannonites-threaten-revolution):\n\n> As The Daily Beast reported on Sunday, Bannon had privately told friends—well after August 7—that Trump and Kelly weren’t itching to fire him; indeed, even supporting him. According to multiple sources close to Bannon and the president, Bannon has described Trump in conversations as “one of us” and a fellow right-wing “nationalist,” who still wanted a him working in his West Wing, despite external and internal pressures.\n\n\n'
"Some are saying Bannon will still have Trump's ear. \n\nI'll believe they're truly separate when Breitbart start treating Trump with the apocalyptic hatred they usually reserve for female comic book characters. "

The Left has been gunning for them because the are so effective at not only fighting the Left, but speaking truth about the Left. And Mr. President has acquiesced.\n\n>Why??\n\n>Unfortunately this is the beginning of the end for the administration.\n\n>With them gone, the Presidency is done for.\n\n>Capitulating to Liberals and delivering to RINOs will not pacify, mollify nor endear any on the Left, but it most certainly will hurt the country and damage his Presidency and reelection. Never Trumpers and Liberals will never support him, say a good word about him, never vote for him, never do anything but continue to lie, libel, smear, slander and slime to bring him down. Appeasing such is beyond futile, its suicide.\n\n>Not only do you damage yourself Mr. President, you damage us. We who loyally support you, this is a slap in our face. And look at the posts by the likes of that idiot ‘Johnsmart’ above? You have weakened us and emboldened the lunatics.

'> This is an incredible, unprecedented moment.  America is being betrayed by its own president. America is under attack and its president absolutely refuses to defend it.\n\n> Simply put, Trump is a traitor and may well be treasonous.\n\nThis.'
'This is sadly accurate \n\n>Trump is right now, before our eyes and those of the world, committing an unbelievable and unforgivable crime against this country. It is his failure to defend.\n\n>The intelligence community long ago concluded that Russia attacked our election in 2016 with the express intention of damaging Hillary Clinton and assisting Trump.\n\n>And it was not only the spreading of inflammatory fake news over social media. As a May report from the Republican-run Senate Intelligence Committee pointed out:\n\n>“In 2016, cyber actors affiliated with the Russian Government conducted an unprecedented, coordinated cyber campaign against state election infrastructure. Russian actors scanned databases for vulnerabilities, attempted intrusions, and in a small number of cases successfully penetrated a voter registration database. This activity was part of a larger campaign to prepare to undermine confidence in the voting process.”'
'Trump is a traitor. This is no longer a rationally debatable point.\n\nHe asked, on national TV, for Russia (a hostile foreign power) to hack into, meddle in and undermine a democratic election process - to actively and deliberately rob each and every American of their fair vote. To *cheat* Americans out of their rightful say in choosing their own leaders, for the benefit of himself. (And now, he\'s trying to alleviate his obvious responsibility for this by suggesting that because another person was President at the time, his crimes somehow mean nothing? Please.)\n\nHe continues to deny Russian collusion despite this being so blindingly, gallingly obvious it\'s a wonder anyone has any retinas left. More than that, he actively encourages it - and is now meeting Putin alone, after all that\'s happened. The entire world can see he is a traitor. \n\nTrump has actively praised and shown respect to dictators - while criticising, insulting and now openly declaring as "foes" America\'s long standing close allies. People who fought with and died for American interests, who trade with America, who share common values with America - who have done nothing but treat America with respect and ongoing friendship. Every action he takes chips away at America\'s freedoms, it\'s global standing, it\'s very credibility.\n\nTrump is a traitor to the United States and he is the antithesis of every good value the US stands for, or has ever stood for, or upon which it was founded. Hell the US was built on tossing out dictators, and on the democratic values of the people Trump now daily (fuck it, hourly) shits all over. His actions in asking for Russia to undermine the election - and the rights of all Americans - is no less treasonous and no less dangerous than if he\'d stood up and asked Russia to carpet bomb Washington DC.\n\nThere is no denying he is a traitor. It is cut and dried. "Make America Great Again" was yet another barefaced lie, because he never, at any point, had America\'s interests in mind. \n\n'
'The media needs to start calling it what it really is. Trump and the Republicans are committing treason.\n\nIt\'s a shame the media is still asking "Is Trump going to confront Putin?". No he\'s not going to confront Putin about the hacking, they were in on it together and are still working together for 2018 and 2020. '
"**Fuck Yes.**\n\nHuge respect to Charles Blow and the Times.\n\n*Finally* we're printing the only message that matters. Sucks that it's two years too late but I'll take it.\n\nTrump is not only outright refusing to defend America from enemies, he's refusing to even acknowledge that our attackers are enemies. \n\n**Trump is a fucking traitor.**"

'While I appreciate the NYT calling the president out they’re preaching to the choir. Everyone who is for/against the president has already made up their mind. The real traitors are the republicans that enable him. We have a system of checks and balances but it doesn’t work when the people entrusted with them are in on the scam. I’d rather see NYT call out Mitch and his buddies. Until mid terms there isn’t even a chance that half of the nation will have any power to stop him and the only way people will be informed to make a change is to vote out their senators/representatives. Until then call out the pos that keeps letting the president get away with this shit so we know who to crucify'
'He absolutely is a traitor, not only to the United States, but Western society as a whole. Trump is an evil man.'
'This is actually one of the first and only articles I have seen that actually gets it right. All the frittering over him lying, offending people, sexually assaulting them, even wrecking healthcare or the economy ... all those things can be fixed within (to a first approximation) one electoral cycle. None of it is within an order of magnitude as important as the simple fact that the president has turned and is collaborating with an enemy that is perpetrating an ongoing attack against the country, explicitly designed to undermine democracy itself.'
"Trump is an idiot with a mental disorder who accidentally won the election with the help of a foreign power and a series of unfortunate circumstances.\n\nThe real offense here is Mitch McConnell and the GOP's complete unwillingness to DO THEIR FUCKING JOBS and hold him accountable for ANYTHING he does."
'Hmm i wonder why Trump is calling the NYT "failing" despite being one of the most successful publications in the country, as it always has been. Surely there can\'t be a coincidence along with him calling the press the enemy of the country. Cause fuck the first amendment, right? There is one country in the entire planet that looks bad if Trump covers for them, while there are dozens of countries for Trump to cuddle up with as easy PR, and yet he still constantly protects Russia while disgustingly trashes EU countries that have been our Allies for decades. As in, risked their lives to fight beside us. There\'s two reasons for someone to defend these actions, they\'re either a paid shill from a hostile state, or they\'re a true American that is so fucking uneducated that a 2nd grader that can\'t read or write has better comprehension skills than them. I suppose i could gather them in with southerners that hate critical thinking. But unfortunately i live in rural Ohio that understands that these people pride themselves on lost battles. 1940s, the confederacy, the 2016 general election, they hold on to lost victories in desperate hopes that it\'ll further their shitty agenda that died and should die with them'
'Treason is a harsh accusation and limited to certain circumstances under the Constitution. AID AND COMFORT TO THE ENEMY is one of them... There is no actual war between Russia and the USA as defined in the Constitution, but Russia DID ATTACK THE USA and in our most sacred institution... free and clear elections. TREASON IS NOT A WORD TOO HARSH TO USE HERE. Trump is a Benedict Arnold.\n\nHe took an oath to defend our Constitution.

'Greed is a sin for a reason.\n\nGreed is whats driving this traitor, and the death cult of Evangelicals will cheer his sins. '
'I dunno - sounds like we should *LOCK HIS TREASONOUS ASS UP!!!*'
"Yes, he is a traitor in the simplest and clearest meaning of that word. He is refusing to stand up to our enemies, and is actually aiding and collaborating with them. That the Republicans in Congress refuse to stop him makes them a gang of thugs at best, traitors themselves at worst. I don't usually talk about politics this way. I consider myself very much a moderate. But this has got to stop. "

This has long gone past a partisan issue, and people who are complicit in this danger are a threat to the country.'
"Trump is like a husband who's cheating and every time his wife brings up his odd and very guilty behavior, he turns it back on her and tries to make it all her fault. Too bad for Donny Dipstick that most of us are past such juvenile attempts at psychological manipulations and can see exactly what he's doing.    "
"He's said more negative shit about Canada and our allies than Putin. Last week's indictments make it clear that Russia attempted to undermine our sovereignty. Now he's going to lick Putin's butthole all week."
"Please don't forget what he's doing to the environment is worse. The death toll of climate change will be untold, and he's massively accelerating it relative to what a sane president would do."

'Jesus lord almighty he is freaking nuts.\n\nBut he knows how to rile up the idiots. I give him credit for being smarter than the dumb asses that voted for him. He can easily manipulate them and they will just nod and obey.\n\nA man who lies, gossips, manipulates, cheated on his several wives, and will gladly grab the pussy of the wives/daughters of so many christians...well, he is the man they flock to.\n\nIs it any wonder that christianity is dead in this country when they see him as godly?'
'This is at least the tenth time I\'ve opened an article thinking, *"They\'ve gotta be over exaggerating, he can\'t possibly make more of an ass of himself,"* only to be proven painfully wrong.\n\nI\'m getting used to it.\n\nAnd that makes me very, very sad.'
'There has to be a reason that EVERY SINGLE TIME the guy gets a foothold in being an actual President (like his speech last night), he blows it to hell within 24 hours.   '
'That was a disaster. Very unpresidented.'
"Every American who didn't vote.  Every American who voted for Trump.  Every voter who voted third party out of spite or irrational hatred of Clinton. \n\nTHIS IS ON YOU."
'So, now, we must ask ourselves the question: How serious is Mattis when he says he has a plan to kill everyone he meets?'
"Even though there have been worse days during the Trump regime, I'm not sure I've ever been so depressed about the state of our country.\n\nThe current president is clearly a corrupt, insane, and ignorant bigot. And yet 35% of the country supports him. One of our two major parties is complicit in all of it. Our media, having made an email server the biggest issue of last year's election, is still normalizing him.\n\nWhat does it take? What on earth is wrong with us? Are we that terrible a people and society?"
"My wife and I decided to watch. It was bizarre. First, he ranted and raved that the mainstream media, particularly CNN, was turning off cameras so that the American public wouldn't be able to watch his speech. *We watched the entire speech on CNN.* Second, he rambled aimlessly quite a bit throughout the speech. He'd start sentences and never finish, jumping to two or three other thoughts before moving on again. As someone who has dealt with three family members with dementia, alzheimers, and strokes, it really appeared that something is going on. \n\nThe whole thing was strange and pathetic. I can't believe this is politics in 2017. "
"So let me get this straight. In his first major public appearance since the accident, he didn't make any mention of the USS McCain collision? No moment of silence for 10 dead US Sailors? No comment on 2 major accidents in 3 months resulting in 17 combined deaths? No comment on the commander of 7th fleet being fired? And furthermore, he had the gall to go into the home state of Sen. McCain (who's father is the ship's namesake) and attack him? These are serious issues that a Commander-in-Chief needs to address, and instead he spent an hour complaining about how HE'S the victim, how everyone is treating HIM unfairly. I'd find it funny if wasn't so very, very sad."
"What an embarrassment he brought his 'woe is me' national tour to my town. Fuck Trump, I hope he doesn't come back anytime soon. All he does is inflame tensions and leave a mess in his wake. "
'I\'m 8k comments deep so this probably won\'t get any views. I was actually watching this last night as I ate dinner and relaxed. I\'m no Trump supporter (go bernie!) but I was once a die hard Republican turned Libertarian who started out as a Alex Jones shill when I was 15-18. I understand both sides... even all 3 or 4 sides if you count Libertarian and conspiracy sides. It was sad to watch him. It was so petty. It sounded like a 10 year old complaining. He said she said. He\'s completely incompetent and can\'t handle this. Besides straight up lying, it was just extremely weird to see a President give rallies like this. For what? "to talk directly to people? - oh please. Obama went around the country giving speeches to get support for Obamacare - one of the most important pieces of legislature ever in America. Trump goes around giving speeches to fulfill his broken ego and lying about facts. No matter how hard Trump tries to destroy and undo Obama\'s legacy, he will never be even a fraction of Obama. I HATED Obama for 8 years and I wish I didn\'t. I really wish he was our president again. Man, it makes me want to cry to see our country in the hands of Trump. '
'"Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you, I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frowned upon, you know, \'cause I\'ve worked in a lot of offices and I tell you people do that all the time."'
'I dislike the articles characterization of the attack in Charlottesville as "a violent clash between white supremacists and counter-protesters that left one woman dead". That makes it seem like it was a brawl between the Left and Right and one woman died durring it.\n\nIt wasnt a clash. It was a bunch of people standing and chanting when a car suddenly plowed through them at high speed. Thats not a "clash" its a fucking terrorist attack. '

'How anyone can listen to this man talk for a couple minutes and not come to the conclusion that he is a damn fool is beyond me. '
"'Our history and our heritage'\n\nI'm not American but even I know two things about that\n\n1. The people that tried to destroy the United States probably are not the people the president should be suggesting are his heritage, especially a president of German ancestry that turned up about 70 years after it ended.\n2. If even I, over here in the UK, am aware that most of these statues were raised in the 1900's in reaction to equal rights legislation and are simply the southern establishment's equivalent of the middle finger to everyone not like them, why is the president of the United States seemingly unaware?\n\nWhen disaster strikes we commemorate the victims, not the perpetrators. \n\nThere are no statues of Sir William Howe in New York City that I am aware of. With good reason. These statues are the equivalent of doing just that.\n\n\n\n"

"Pelosi's been on fire lately. \n\nThey should be bringing his contradicting tweets up on a daily basis. There's no shortage of them!"
'Doesn\'t make a difference. Trump could shoot a kitten on live TV and SHS would deny it ever happened the next day. Hannity would say the Deep State hacked the feed and used CG to doctor the footage, which was "actually" Trump petting a dog. End of the day, nothing changes.'
'Remember when "read my lips: no new taxes" basically killed any chance HW Bush had at re-election?'
"Neither Trump nor his supporters care what Trump may or may not have said in the past. They follow him blindly and without reservation. Remember when Trump said he could go out on 5th Ave (or wherever) and shoot someone and he wouldn't lose any supporters? He was absolutely right. Absolutely right. "
'Trump supporters: WTF I hate Medicare!'
"Wait, so Trump's a huge *liar?*  And his base doesn't care because they're really just ignorant *racists?*\n\nOh boy, this news day is just full of shocking revelations!"
'People who call him out on his hypocrisy and outright lies are forgetting two key things.\n\n1. His supporters absolutely do not care. Sure some of them will take cuts to their benefits, but so will liberals. That makes it okay. Trump could shit in their mouths and they would love it because the liberal standing next to them would have to smell it.\n\n2. Undecided voters and independents are some of the most insanely stupid people on the planet. Rivaling Trump supporters themselves. In 2020, 2022, 2024, ect many of them wont even seem to remember who Trump or any of these insane republicans are.'
"Ok. Genuinely has he kept a single promise? \n\nHe said Mexico is paying for the wall. They aren't.\n\nHe said he would find a replacement to Obamacare and that nobodies rates would go up. He didn't and they did. \n\nHe said he would talk cut Medicare, medicade, or social security. He is. \n\nHe said he would fix the issues in the middle East. He hasn't. \n\nHe said he would drain the swamp. He didn't, but he did go ahead and add about 100' of his own sewage that spewed from his own mouth.\n\nSo honestly. Why does anyone support him when he has done the exact opposite of everything he promised? I know it's 90% neo Nazis and racists but come on. Does your hate for others really make it worth sacrificing your own well being? That's just fucking stupid. I'd say they deserve it but everyone is getting sucked into this shit. "
'"old Trump tweet"\n\nThis was a core part of his platform. It was central to his whole "forgotten Americans" bullshit. He hammered other Republicans on it repeatedly. What a piece of shit.'
'Old man Trump is such a piece of shit. That bastard needs to be removed from the office. Absolute disgrace to our entire nation. Also, Trump supporters are scum of the Earth.'
"For what purpose?  Using fact and logic to fight Donald Trump has NEVER been effective. He was elected off of anger and ego of racists and white rural voters who are mad that Obama didn't bring back their precious coal jobs. "
'The thing is, there are a lot of Republican voters who don\'t even know about Trump\'s tweets. A lot of people just watch Fox News, and they never mention his tweets. I know someone who showed their family members the tweets and they called it "fake news, the President would never do that." Then they showed them his actual Twitter account. Their reaction? They doubled down on supporting him.  \n  \nWhy? Because if you challenge someone a truth contrary to what they believe, it\'s just way too much for them to face head-on, so fight or flight kicks in. Goddamnit, wtf are we supposed to do against that? '
"This route will never result in any meaningful loss in support. He will simply refuse to ever address going back on his word. Or deny he ever said it. And, failing all of that, he will wave his hand and say something about having to make the tough decisions owing to the American carnage he was handed by Obama. \n\nAnyone thinking more of this will lead to his undoing, I fear, is mistaken, deluded, or both. If hypocrisy was going to be his undoing he'd have never won."
'Trump lies, people call him a liar. He lies again. people call him a liar. He lies again. People call him a liar. He lies again...ad nauseum.\n\nDo you know what the definition of insanity is?\n\nThis is all a part of the gas lighting handbook.'
'Breaking News: Liar Lies Like a Liar'
"Because he's a pathological lying insecure egomaniacal ignorant asshole who says whatever bullshit comes to mind or that he's been fed and remembers long enough to regurgitate on camera. I bet he doesnt know or understan half, no, a tenth, if that, of what he's saying. "
'Trump is a man that refused to say he would admit defeat of Hillary won.  He was ready to declare it rigged and a fraud and never surrender.  What is going to happen if he loses the election in 2 years?  Is this a man willing to submit and pass the torch?'
"Netflix could continue House of Cards with this crap shoot we're living in and it would have high enough rating to continue on for a few more years."
'Lying liar and the lies they tell.'
'I like the idea that Trump is actually stuck in the past trying to warn us through tweets about the horrific stuff hes about to do'

"I'm a male, but I would imagine that as a woman there must not be much to look up to in Melania, unless you're a prospective gold digger like her.

"A man who has done so much damage to our country, in such a short period of time is taking a vacation. Based on how hard it is to fuck up our status in the world, not pass a single piece of legislation with majorities in Congress, and watch TV 24/7 I think he's deserved it.\n\nJust wish there was a way to make it permanent."
'One piece of intriguing scuttlebutt is that he\'s recently had a surgical suite installed in his NJ residence and I suppose one could infer from this that he\'ll be having his hair reinstalled or having a facelift procedure or somesuch vainglorious nonsense. It would explain the 17 days of potential recovery time out of the spotlight. \n\nUnder normal circumstances it\'s common knowledge when the president undergoes surgery (necessitates the V.P taking charge temporarily) but such trifling matters probably aren\'t a consideration for Trump. \n\nInterestingly there was a widely circulated rumour around Westminster that the then British PM David Cameron had a cosmetic procedure (publicly acknowledged by his office as a "procedure to correct a minor facial blemish") that was botched to a degree and led to him completely vanishing from public view for a few days for seemingly no reason. Maybe Trump has learnt from his mistake and has scheduled some time away from the cameras in case things go awry. \n\nJust rumours and I claim no particular knowledge of these events but just some interesting gossip that\'s been doing the rounds.'
"I don't mind presidents taking vacations. They all do it. Hell, it's definitely needed as that's one of the most stressful jobs in the world. However, I do mind when they are hypocrites about it. "
'Presidenting is hard, especially when he\'s so fucking bad at it and can\'t do his fucking Job.  He can shout all the racist, sexist, and just mean shit that he wants, but all that does is pump up his base.  Tweeting is not governing, shouting down the news and calling it "fake" is not governing.  And frankly I\'m glad he\'s terrible at his job, god forbid he got off his ass and tried to accomplish any of the shit he said he was going to do.  So thank the heavens for his ineptitude.  Impeach this fuck.'
'If I was a GOP Senator I would be flipping furious right now.\n\n"Vacation? After YOU told us to stay? What vacation do you need after how many days you had golfing already? What happens if there is a crisis?

"Thank God. Take a longer vacation. Trump is not getting anything done.  This is my worst vote for a president ever. I thought he was going to be a deal maker and bring both parties together to move the country forward. I guess he's a bullshitter. This sucks. I thought we were electing a businessman, a CEO, a Dealmaker. We got a Snake Oil Salesman. He's so partisan. I thought he would be  bipartisan since he was a Democrat in the past. I'm from Connecticut and grew up familiar with Trump all my life. I've always known him to be a Democrat. This Trump we have now is totally different. What is wrong with this guy? This whole Russia issue I was not expecting. I for one am not in denial. This President is not acting innocent. Why can't he just come out publicly against the Russians. He talks so much crap about everybody else. Why doesn't he talk like that about the Russians. And he's always caught in a lie. It's like he's the worlds worst Liar. I get so frustrated when he lies about sensless shit. Like the boys scouts calling him after the speech. That's just stupid shit to lie about. I JUST DON'T GET IT. HE'S  A BULLSHITTER.

"This is not surprising considering that Trump is the biggest fraud in American History. He's all about himself and will accomplish nothing with a Republican Congress and Senate which is pathetic. \nHe's never been about charity and never will be. He's obsessed with being ranked high on the Forbes list. \nHe's nothing more than a trust-fund baby along with his kids, led by Princess Ivanka and Secretary of Everything Jared Kushner. "
"One of the saddest things about this is how trump supporters refuse to acknowledge any of these direct lies. They dismiss every single post within seconds with anything they can say. It's just so depressing. They are desperate to defend the administration, at all costs. Nothing anyone says could change their viewpoint and that's fucked up. "

'"Listen Donald, we\'re going to Impe..." \n\n"I QUIT" \n\n"Yeah, umm you don\'t get to quit, we\'re filing for impea...."\n\n"I have thought about this very much, much thinking.

'Just more stupid posturing from the crazy left. Plain stupid. '
"I mean, in 7 months, he fired the FBI director, said he wanted to keep the guy who had been removed because of illegal dealings with Russians, he threatened to remove the guy inspecting him, he lost two comms directors, didn't manage to pass any major legislation, had a spat with multiple allies leaders, has multiple close staff/family members investigated, threatened a war with North Korea over twitter and managed to fail to denounce Nazis. \nEDIT: Probably forgot a lot of stuff over the months."
"Half the country hated he last president too, wasn't leading the news every night though was it.\n\nWhy is that "
"I find myself kind of agreeing with this woman.  We can't have a President who says both the left and right are violent.  That just can't stand.  And we certainly can't have a sitting President wake up every morning *without* repeatedly disavowing Nazis and white supremacists.  He's gotta do that shit everyday for it to count.  And he hasn't called the family of the woman who was ran over by that racist.  That can't stand either.  We need a President that calls the families of victims of white nationalism.  Trump's gotta go.  "
"I don't agree with the president and he hurt my feelings = impeach him\n\nthe irrational left everyone!"
"I didn't vote for Trump. But he won. I'm not wasting the next 3+ years talking shit and getting my blood pressure jacked up. I'm going to be respectful and sit back offering my help wherever I can. Everybody is just playing into a really scary time in our Nation's history. It's getting ludicrous. I am a huge Civil War buff. I think taking down the statues is a mistake. Emancipation Park?  You wanna go get some Freedom Fries before we go down to the rally. I don't want anything to do with the KkK or the fucking Nazis that stand for the statues remaining. Nazis have nothing to do with Robert E Lee. We are letting all this shit Fuck with history. It's up to us to define what the Civil War means to our country. Instead of discussing, on a National level, what was going on in our country back then and what Robert E Lee's role was, why the Civil War happened (it wasn't just about slavery) we actually whitewash history. These people belonged to United States of America rightvuo until they created the Confederate States of America. We are acting as if Lee was some form of Hitler. The CSA's government fuctioned almost exactly like the USA's. This has turned into a nightmare.  All this shit talking only makes things worse. It blows my mind when I think of all the forums, subs, blogs, newspaper and magazine space that's filled with people's opinions, points of view, angry responses, suggestions and of course the old this is- what- is- going-wrong-and-this-is-how-we-should-fix-its. "
"Anyone familiar with the 25th amendment realizes this would be an abuse and inapplicable to remove a President in this context. If you have an issue with President Trump doing things you don't like than either petition Congress or vote the man out of office. "
'I\'d rather see an impeachment resulting from current investigations. Something with a mountain of irrefutable evidence so big that future conspiracy nuts get laughed out of the room whenever they try to claim he was framed.\n\nBecause unless Trump strips naked and runs down Pennsylvania Avenue crying about the martians who have been anally probing him, removal for being "mentally unfit" will lead this country down a very dangerous path. There will be too many people who see it as nothing more than a 3rd world coup.  \n\n'
"Here is how the article defines the 25th Amendment:\n\n>In fact, the amendment was created after former President John F. Kennedy was assassinated to provide a clear path of what would happen if a president and or vice president couldn't perform their duties. \n\nRegardless of what you think of Trump and his mental capacity either he can't perform the job duties or he's choosing not to. Still today over 100 top jobs in his administration are not filled because he hasn't nominated people for the job. [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/07/17/us/politics/trump-appointments.html)\n\nVirtually no legislation has been passed and I'm not counting Executive Orders. How many people have resigned or been fired only 7 months in? How many current or former members of the administration are under investigation? There are currently 5 separate investigations going on right now into this administration. [Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/trump-russia-investigations/)\n\nIt's a dumpster fire. it's a shitshow. Get rid of him - he doesn't care about this job and he isn't fit for it. The things I posted don't even go into all of the other crazy things that have transpired under this administration. It's a complete circus that cannot sustain itself. For the good of the country he needs to go."
"So Trump says stuff at a press conference.  This bitch doesn't like it, so Trump should be removed as president?  Pathetic!"
"Let's be honest. Trumps not being removed from office. Hilary isn't going to jail. Obama isn't part of a shadow government illuminati conspairicy. Wishing death on anyone else is a shit thing to do, yes even if you disagree with their politics. Nuclear war isn't impending. Neither is world war 3 or civil war 2. The news stations aren't pushing false agendas just their own shitty biases. No the protesters aren't getting paid, if we can't have a civil discussion on how to remove statues, most made to honor veterans yes even confederate veterans, we should just leave it and come back to it at a different point. After the south surrendered they were pardoned slowly until a full unconditional pardon on 12/25/1868. After 150 years maybe we should just try to move forward? Nazis have been allowed to march since the 70's. We don't have to like them but they have their right to look like morons in public. Look up Illinois nazis, shown in blues brothers, yes it's based on a real thing. Any American dying no matter how dispicable and low or godly and genuine is tragic. Just like family you don't have to like them, just love them. Emotions are high. Left right center up down wherever on the political spectrum you fall, take a break. Go be with your family's. Turn off the news, close the computers. Enjoy each other. We're not here forever. Experience life. Don't short change yourself so worried about insignificant rich idiots. Whom ever they are."
'This may not go anywhere, but it should. \nWe just watched the man play a game of crazy with NK then a few days later defend actual nazis. The gop needs to understand the shame in removing him now is nowhere near as bad as its going to be after he makes some historically tragic mistake.'
'I mean, I don\'t like the guy, but this is kinda dumb. Not only would it almost certainly not happen, while he\'s been a twat, there\'s not a ton outside of 3rd party hyperbole that\'s he\'s "unfit" in any worthwhile sense. Stop constantly calling for impeachment or removal until there\'s something that can actually, concretely, make it happen. Otherwise it will become dull nonsense. '
"Impeaching Trump would probably tear this country in half. It would be catastrophic. We should allow him to carry out his full term and vote him out in November of 2020. We're worried about Nazis and the far right being emboldened **now**? Man, you'd never seen anything like it had the guy that some of them voted in was impeached or kicked out of office. Forget water turning the frogs gay, this would be a conspiracy that would actually unite the right. We have to actually be liberal about Trump's presidency. Not meet it with hardheadedness and disregard for the future of this nation. "
"Never going to happen. Neither will he be impeached. \n\nUnfortunately you're (or we as he is fucking up the world) are stuck with him until the next election... Besides pence is probably worse "
"Seriously, for the the faults this guy keeps making it's shocking he's still around. Imagine this on any other scale, of any job. He'd have been gone day one most likely.\n\nHow is it that the president is held to lower expectations then someone working say, fast food? "
'why the fuck do people take everything to the extreme with Trump? He\'s a shitty person who\'s the president...that\'s it. But people blow everything he does way out of proportion. Calm the fuck down. We have a bad president. He isn\'t "mentally unstable" or a "literal nazi" or "unhinged" or about to start world war 3 TONIGHT. \n\n\n\n\nTrump hasn\'t fucked anything up yet and people are already losing their shit. Once he *actually* fucks something up, this whole country is gonna be on suicide watch if they continue at this rate. It\'s a "the people who cried wolf" type of scenario. '
'If stupidity was a mental disorder that prevented you from holding office, there would be no one left in Congress.'
"And now she'll he inudated with death threats. "
"Unfortunately, nothing will happen. The GOP doesn't care about the treason. They also will not care about the obvious mental illness. "

'1984 is and forever will be a guide on how to identify fascism and whether or not your country has already fallen. The aspect of fascism that Orwell focused on the most (and that shaped that dystopic society) was the manipulation of the truth, of reality itself.\n\n\nThe power Big Brother has to shape the truth to whatever suits their needs is the thing that keeps them in power, it allows them to control everyone and everything, for if no one knows the truth and reality changes every day, how can anyone know what is wrong or that there is even a problem? For fascists to stay in power, they must keep the people blind and what better to blind the people than to blind reality itself.\n\n\nAs Orwell wrote:\n\n"the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears, it was their final, most essential command."\n\n\n\nDo not let fascism rise again, how many more millions of people must die for the human race to get it, fascism is evil and all those who partake are thusly evil. The time to revolt is now. '

'Maddow\'s A block dealt with the information warfare being waged right now, and this was a big part of it.  Honestly it was chilling. \n\nWhat was worse, though, was the end of that block where she covered how no one on the US side has any idea what happened in the Trump-Putin meeting, yet the Russian media is going on and on about how their military is anxious to start acting on the agreement regarding Syria.  The CENTCOM Commander came out saying he hadn\'t received any order and he wouldn\'t want to shift gears lightly; the Russian media hammered him for contradicting the "*Supreme* Commander in Chief."   They have their hooks in him, and they\'re using it to drive a wedge between the executive branch and rhe military.  '
"It's insanity. You saw what their plan is for the midterms just recently, if the Dems win anything of consequence it will be Russian interference causing it. We are in a full blown American existential crisis. If Mueller does not find a way to topple Trump I will not be surprised to see blood in the streets."

Maybe it's a dumb distinction for me to make but somehow failing to type something up in the official transcript is one thing, but to actually go and edit out the offending video REQUIRES clear malice aforethought. It's just fucking terrifying."
"It's actually terrifying to me how frequently the current White House administration alters the transcripts and videos that are *supposed to be an official, unadulterated record available to the public*, to remove things that make Trump look bad. This has happened a couple times recently and they tried to brush it off as an honest mistake.\n\nThis happening again should be the biggest story in the news right now. People should be outraged. The White House should be feeling tremendous pressure from all sides right now for so blatantly changing reality and the public record. THIS IS WHAT DICTATORS AND AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES DO! This is LITERALLY what Putin does, and did, with the official transcripts of the recent summit, editing out anything that was embarrassing to the regime.\n\nWhy the fuck are you Americans letting the Trump administration get away with this? Your democracy is slipping away right before your eyes and nobody seems to even give a shit. Just look how little attention this thread seems to be getting compared to others. It's mind boggling. Wake up people!"

'The irony is that the GOP/WH trying to deny the "shithole" comment will in fact WANT to release the tapes because Trump knows this incites his base.

'What\'s the point? They will just deny what was said on the tapes and claim "fake news." We all got the jist of what was said. It was racist and exclusionary either way.  We all know that\'s how Trump rolls. '

Left or right, you gotta be sick of this nonsense by now.  i really hope people have learned their lesson this time around and vote on actual issues next time.  we\'ve become a shit-show, media driven political system, with people religiously adhering to 2-party extreme lies and propaganda.  And tada - here we have a dumbass reality TV star as president, with a broken an ineffectual Congress.  we deserve this shit.  its time we start paying attention and pushing the media to focus on actual political issues.

"I honestly suspect Durbin was recording himself. Likely, he is calling on the WH to release the tapes because if he simply came out and released his version, all you would hear on the news is word vomit about the dirty Democrats secretly recording conversations - as if there weren't a good reason to record what Trump says. \n\nHonestly, it doesn't really matter at this point. Reasonable people know the truth and the rest had Fox News shoveling nonstop shit down their throats about how he didn't say 'those words'. People's position won't change. We, and the world, already know Trump said it. We know he is a liar. There are corroborating witnesses that he said it, including Republicans. I don't see how *more* proof will make a difference. If it does, by all means, go for it. "

"So ol' George was quite happy being a Republican all through Ronald Reagans treason and insanity, the real witch hunt that was the pursuit of Clinton, the utter dumbness of George Bush and the economic melt down that it led to and 8 years of obstruction of everything Obama tried to do as well as stealing a supreme court judge nomination?

'What Republican Party ?. There is no Republican Party as this country once knew it. What this country has , since everything needs a name, is Trumpism, the cult party of Trump led by a clinical narcissist, pathological lying wannabe dictator obsessed with lying, deceit, deflection and propaganda.'
"George Will is not going to influence Trump supporters. They don't care. They don't know who he is.\n\nI used to agree with much of what he said, but the republican party lost me with the lies, torture and greed under the Bush administration.\n\nIt sometimes takes experience and reflection to have empathy for others, to understand the republican party has always been tribalist, greedy, fascist. \n\nInteresting to see the line it takes to cross for people, even those with intellectual honesty of a sort to discover themselves.

I’m only pointing out we definitely seem to be regressing, and have been for a while. I am also not taking any sides.\n\n Partisanship and identity politics is bringing down so much progress, and it seems to be only getting worse. From race, class, age, sexual orientation, sex, religion, and of course politics. Basically, you will be identified and categorized into anything you can imagine. \n\n Instead of being a people united, and slowly understanding our differences. We’ve literally missed the point and seem to just focus on the differences between us. We’ve somehow become destructive with a team or tribal attitude focused on *what* we are instead of who we are. \n \n Make no mistake - all sides are guilty.

'Trump is a bigot racist prick.'
'Probably going to try and get the judge removed for bias, no doubt about it.\n\n'
"The GOP has spent years 'educating' its members that judges are activists, and fundamentally aren't fair any and every time they rule against the GOP.  Perhaps this is because fair and unbiased application of the law will usually result in rulings against them, so they need some explanation to feed the poor and middle class members of their party to keep them voting against their own interests.\n\nThus, we had members of the GOP who literally believed that a gay judge could not be fair in a case about gay marriage.  After all, he's gay.  He must have an interest in one side (as if a straight judge wouldn't).\n\nI'm sure we'll get the same thing with a Mexican American judge presiding over the border wall case.

Worse case the judge, being a professional, will be hypersensitive to that and will over correct in Trumps favor.

"Hi everyone, local puertorican gal here working from Bayamon PR. You'll be impressed at the amount of puertoricans saying that we are snowflakes and being too sensitive because the president threw some paper towels. These are puertoricans stationed in the US as well as here, saying that. That we shouldn't be appalled. That what he said about the budget its true so we shouldn't be offended because its the truth. Alas, i understand that it might be true, I'm not discrediting that but its not like we purposely stationed ourselves in the middle of the hurricane, shit happens, like in any other place. We didn't ask for this, we were prepared but who knew how horrible the damage would be, no one had any sort of precedent; if you're being rescued in a fire you dont tell the victim that the town/water company budget will be impacted trying to save them... why? Because they are too traumatized to begin with and its just not the time or place. Same with mass shootings, upping security means more money spent, same with medical care... are you gonna tell a mass shooting victim that the hospital and medicare will get their budget hit because of the tragedy?\n\nIn Katrina, they had a hurricane and then the levees that were constructed weren't made well enough and collapsed, IN Sandy no one thought that the coast would be decimated, with Harvey who knew that the massive amount of rainfall would drown out most of the streets of Texas, when Irma hit we never thought we were going to be spared and we were even though our neighboring islands weren't...\n\n...and then our nightmare began when Maria Cat 5 hurricane hit and lasted over 13 hours destroying so many of the island we once knew. Its so hard seeing so many polarizing views when there are so many people DYING lack of medical care, lack of supplies, food, water and power. Its about saving lives but they dont see that. They even talk shit about Yulin, the San Juan Mayor lacking leadership when she lost part of her house, was sleeping in cots with her fellow citizens, when she plunged in chest deep waters calling out to people needing help, she has done what 75% of the rest of the mayors haven't done and then this shit president has the audacity to call her an ingrate and criticize her when she was just calling out the lack of logistics and the amount of red tape holding everything up, which wasn't even a direct attack on trump. Its just so terrible the amount of division this has created when we should be united. Its sickens me that they still defend this fucking garbage with tooth and nail.\n\nWe thank Mexico for giving us aid even when they are going through a disaster themselves with the earthquake that happened a couple weeks ago, so much heart...\n"
'Newsweek slaps headlines with very childish angst as disastrous smear campaign begins to peak with sensationalist "journalism".\n\n/facepalm\n\nI thought the whole idea of bashing Trump for his very poor choice of words was to be better than him?  What happened to taking the high road? What happened to standing on issues and arguments worthy of merit?\n\nOnly news in the article is the efforts of Mexico.  I\'d like to see a total of efforts of the US and if, in comparison, it really is a "slap in the face"\n\nOdds are it\'s not, its not even close.  Not that it\'s a competition, it\'s good that everyone is helping.  It\'s just dumb to try to make it into one, to try and frame it as if the US has done nothing.  '

Him and his cronies are beyond the pale of what can be considered acceptable in politics, and in life in general. This isn’t even that crazy of a story, it’s just one more piece to add to the already *massive* pile of evidence against him and his company. Why why why WHY do these republican officials continue to defend him and his people? Can they really not see that they’re on the wrong side of history? We will look back on this time as some of the lowest our politics has ever sunk. There is no bottom to this pit, there is nothing these people wouldn’t do, no contradiction too heinous, no strategy too immoral. They’re the worst people with the most power and I’m so sick and tired of people acting like *any* of this is okay. It’s not okay. It’s so FUCKED and it just gets worse and it hasn’t once gotten any better. He’s exactly as disappointing as we thought he’d be, probably even more so. And if you can read all these stories and choose not believe them, fuck you. If you can read these stories and believe them and *still* support him then fuck you even more. And what a crude thing to say, but there’s no better way to put it. It’s just an unfathomable time for our country right now.  '

"You\'re Fired" was LITERALLY his catch-phrase and the thing people know him the most for.\n\nThis may mean high turnover, but it also means that the Executive branch strives for excellence."\n\nThe logic is that he\'s consistently inconsistent.

"The real AND fake media, by the way," he adds.\n\n> Trump says CEOs are quitting his council because they\'re not doing their jobs and are embarrassed that they don\'t manufacture in America.\n\n> Trump says he "didn\'t take long" to condemn neo-Nazis: "I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct."\n\n> Recall that Trump has repeatedly declared various incidents to be Islamic terror before any official confirmation. \n\n> Trump is angry about criticism. "This event just happened" when I spoke, Trump said,  and the media still doesn\'t know the facts.\n\n> Trump keeps saying "I wanted to see the facts." In June, he declared a Phillipines robbery a terror attack. \n\n> This is unreal...\n\n> Trump: "The driver of the car is a disgrace to himself, his family, this country...you can call it terrorism, you can call it murder."\n\n> (Why did he not say this Saturday or Monday?)\n\n> "He\'s not a racist. He\'s a good person...but we\'ll see what happens with Mr. Bannon," the president says of his chief strategist.\n\n> Trump: "Define alt-right to me. No, define it for me. Define it for me." "What about the alt-left? That came charging?" Whoa whoa whoa.\n\n> Trump is now BLASTING THE CHARLOTTESVILLE PROTESTERS: "They came swinging with clubs."\n\n> Trump: "You had a group on one side that was bad," but "the other side was also very violent"..."without a permit...very very violent."\n\n> Trump: "Not all of those people were neo-Nazis...not all of those people were neo-Nazis..."... Some merely wanted the Robert E. Lee statue.\n\n> Trump is going full alt-right.\n\n> Trump: "Where does it stop?" Next week it\'ll be Stonewall Jackson statues...\n\n> In ONE minute, Trump swung from his harshest condemnation of the car attacker to attacking the protesters and defending the alt-right.\n\n> "There is another side," Trump says. "You can call them the left...they came, VIOLENTLY attacking the other group...THAT\'s the way it is."\n\n> Trump has never, ever been this publicly angry in his two years in national politics.\n\n> Trump: "George Washington was a slaveowner...so will George Washington, now, lose his status?" "How \'bout Thomas Jefferson?"\n\n> Trump: "You\'re changing history. You\'re changing culture."\n\n> This is like a quintuple-down to the power of eighty. All of the subtext of Trump\'s Saturday statement has become explicit, enraged text.\n\n> Trump: "I own actually one of the largest wineries in the United States. It\'s in Charlottesville."\n\n> Trump says he\'s going to fix race relations by providing jobs from which "people will be making a lot more money."\n\n> This was an infrastructure event. Trump held up a project-approval flowchart. And then: white rage.\n\n> White supremacists said yesterday that Trump\'s condemnation was clearly insincere. Pundits were more generous.

The Senate should kill it. Full stop. Those who attack protesters, weaponizing their vehicles like terrorists, should find no safe haven in our state.\n\nThe North Carolina GOP is the most cravenly and disgustingly partisan organizations in existence right now, completely entrenched in power by virtue of aggressive and precise gerrymandering. They've been forced to roll back certain voter-suppression techniques they used in the 2016 election because they were literally caught asking for what types of ID blacks were more likely to use, and then specifically excluding those types of ID from the lists of eligible voter IDs.

"I'm making a throwaway to say this since going against the current here - and in this case it's a tsunami - often gets you banned, but I have to say this. \n\nI'm a liberal, and I agree with everything he said. \n\nNeo-Nazis and white supremacists deserve our condemnation and our contempt. They have no place in America. The alt-left and antifa however are routinely violent aggressive thugs that use physical violence against anyone they consider a 'Nazi', which at this point if you listen to what they say is a remarkably big tent. For many of them, including some people in this thread who are literally saying it in their posts, a 'Nazi' at this point is anyone who voted for or continues to support Trump. That basically means you are okay with physical violence against nearly half the people in the country. And if you believe that, you are just as bad as any real Nazi. \n\nThe fringe on the left that is the mirror of the fringe on the right is just as bad, just as violent, and just as insane as their counterparts. Have been for years. We saw it on the news at numerous Trump rallies during the campaign where they attacked people just for supporting Trump. And at this point, anyone who disagrees with them on any of a myriad amount of issues including gender, marriage, race, pronouns, capitalism, trans-issues or any number of identity issues is literally a 'Nazi' and deserves to be violently attacked. \n\nThey are out of control, have been for some time, and I'm glad Trump is saying so. \n\n\n"
"For everyone saying BLM is just as bad... BLM regularly protests alongside white people. Their most prominent members go on television and condemn violence. They're not a hate group, and they're not terrorists. \n\nYou show me how many black or Jewish neo-Nazis you can find outside of a Dave Chapelle skit and tell me they're the same. Their leaders encourage violence. Their mission is about hatred and bigotry.\n\nBLM's mission is to encourage justice under the law and police reform. While some violent extremists may align themselves with them, they are not themselves violent extremists and do not want those people involved. Small groups chanting for violence are not carrying out the message. Leadership is not encouraging anyone to take up arms.\n\nThis false equivalency from people who've never attended a BLM event in their lives drives me fucking bonkers."

'My family was gifted land by the state government of South Carolina after the Revolutionary War for significant aid to the Continental Army and State Militias fighting the British. My several times great grandfather on my father\'s side was named Emanuel Martin Corder. He and his brother, Morgan, were in the 19th SC Infantry. His brother was killed in action in Rome, GA. On my mother\'s side there is George Newton Billings, of the "Bloody 8th NY" at Cold Harbor, husband of Grace Bedell, famous for the Lincoln letters. At Arlington National Cemetery there lies "Hard Times" Corder, really named Hardee, of the 3rd US Pioneer Infantry Battalion, died October 1918 in France. Then there are my grandfathers, an Army sharpshooter one, and a Marine, the other. Then my late father, an infantryman who helped people escape East Germany, and was later recalled for Desert Storm. Then there is I.. An Eagle Scout, JROTC kid, and now 34 year old infantry veteran of 1-26 Infantry, a battalion famous for taking more losses than any other since Vietnam. I personally washed peices of a Medal of Honor winner named Ross Andrew McGinnis out of his truck with bottles of water and paper towels. As someone whose family is part of the lifeblood of this nation.. Someone who has witnessed the ultimate sacrifice and has engaged America\'s enemies head on..

'People, if you haven\'t read [Bill Browder\'s *Red Notice*](https://smile.amazon.com/Red-Notice-Finance-Murder-Justice/dp/1476755744), it\'s high time you do. This lead to the Magnitsky Act, which is one of the biggest things that Putin and Russia\'s oligarchs want removed.\n\nIf you think that any US citizen that Russia wants to "question" will come back the same person (or come back at all), you\'re deluding yourselves. Russia has repeatedly tried to get Browder arrested and sent to Russia using fraudulent [Red Notices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol_notice), which Interpol have repeatedly refused to honor because they\'re so obviously corrupt.\n\nRussia wants Browder, and they\'ll use any means to get him.

So fuck Trump, fuck Putin, and fuck this adminstration for enabling Trump. '
'Ok, I have been holding out hope that maybe, just maybe everything up unto this point was some kind of magical coincidence; But the past 72 hours we have learned that Trump either lacks any ability to actually criticize people and is *incredibly* ignorant & petty, he\'s being black mailed by the Russians or doesn\'t want his pride hurt by admitting he was wrong about Russia interfering, or he\'s legitimately a Russian Asset. I literally see no other alternatives at this point.\n\nI\'m just flabbergasted, disappointed, and disgruntled that this is what our country has turned into. With each new shoe drop in the Trump Russia scandal I think to myself "this has to be the turning point" and I am always surprised by the vague response form Americans on this. Our president, whom we supposedly elected, is essentially working for Russia, whether he knows it or not, and that in and of it self is probably grounds for impeachment and a follow up indictment. \n\nJesus Fucking Christ somebody do something before it\'s too late. \n\nEdit: Spelling '

'This is absolutely insane, and quite frankly, absolutely terrifying due to the unprecedented nature of everything encompassing this clusterfuck, along with the potential precedents that could be set, if shipping off United States citizens to a hostile foreign country, led by a murderous foreign dictator for "questioning" ever becomes a practice. If Trump sends Browder over to Putin, Browder\'s not coming back. Infact, if I were him, I\'d be shitting my fucking pants right now. The man has these unsubstantiated, sketchy-ass allegations being thrown at him by the Russian government, and he can\'t shake the feeling that Putin has his eyes set on torturing the fuck out of him. Not because of the "allegations" however - that\'s likely just a ruse - but rather due to Browder\'s criticisms of Putin, and the sanctions placed on Russia that he had lobbied for. Putin very likely wants to kill Browder for being a nuisance to his agenda. The same goes for Christopher Steele, and former ambassador McFaul. *Interesting* selection of people wanted for "questioning" by Putin. And he wants Trump to deliver them up on a silver fucking platter, which scares me because Donny is a fucking braindead, compromised marionette dancing to the tune of Vlad, which leads me to believe there\'s a startling possibility that he will follow Geppetto\'s orders and send anyone requested.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd then there\'s the *warm* invitation from The Kremlin for Special Prosecutor Robert Muller and his team to travel to Russia and attend the "questioning" of the 12 indicted Russian operatives, *on the condition* that Russia is permitted to "interrogate some people who have something to do with illegal actions in the territory of Russia". Yeah, because as if the constant ambiguity on the part of the Russians isn\'t disconcerting enough, just go ahead and invite the Special Prosecution - the same people indicting their fucking operatives and hammering away to expose Putin\'s agenda - because I can\'t see how anything could go wrong there. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe way I see it, Helsinki really solidified it for me that Trump *truely* is a traitorous, cowardly, sack of shit, who cares not for the country he is supposed to lead, is almost certainly compromised by Putin, and that the two of these motherfuckers have been working hand in hand with each other for quite some time now (call it "collusion"). I can\'t help but feel in the pit of my stomach that things are going to escalate soon, some heads may roll, and the road to dangerous precedents will be paved. I\'m not sure what, entirely, but something needs to be done like yesterday to address it. '

"Well since this is shareblue, there's clearly some important and relevant information intentionally left out of the headline for the sole intention of painting Trump in a bad light.\n\n\nIf Trump really is as bad as his opponents claim, there would be no need to embellish headlines in this incredibly unethical manner as the untampered truth should be more than enough to condemn him.\n\n\nAnd now I anticipate a bunch of comments from people stupidly defending propaganda for reasons that would give them gold in the mental gymnastics Olympics."
"You people need to start reading\n\n>The VA said it was essentially ending a special $460 million program that has dramatically reduced homelessness\n\nThe VA is choosing to reallocate funds on its own. This isn't a Trump policy.\n\nChoose your damn battles, and stop exaggerating. You lose credibility when you spin things like this."
'Sorry if this comment is controversial, but President Donald Trump is a piece of shit. He never had bone spurs. He’s lying sack of shit. \n\nSorry if I’ve lowered the tone of this place. 😐'
"Donald Trump doesn't love the troops. Donald Trump doesn't love the poor. Donald Trump doesn't love the working class. Donald Trump doesn't love anyone that isn't Donald Trump. "
'"God damn lazy librul vets need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps already!" - the GOP, suddenly'
"Not a single conservative or right-wing site has picked this story up, but that's not surprising. There is literally no way to spin this. \n\nBrowsed multiple comments sections where conservatives normally pop up and nothing. The silence is deafening. \n\nBut football players can't kneel because it disrespects the military....."
"Every single group Trump is betraying Coal, military, Union workers, all of them voted for him. \n\nWhat did Michael Moore Say? Gonna seem really funny in the beginning but when the reality sets in the joke will be on you. The Rural GOP Zealots are about to learn a harsh lesson in reality. \n\nThe rich don't care about you. Your skin color isn't a ticket to an exclusive club, it is a marker of gullibility in their world. Trump sees poor white people as marks, nothing more nothing less. The man probably has a Messiah complex. "

"Picking on an American war hero dying of brain cancer?  That's how you know he's a patriot and an alpha.  -TD"
'Yet he is silent on Michael Avenatti. That’s because he knows Avenatti will chew him up and spit him out, humiliate the daylights out of him. Like all bullies, Trump only goes after the people who are less able to take on a fight with this pathetic monster. I can’t wait for the new crop of millennial politicians to take this disgusting piece of crap down.'
"That's the thing, he's playing to the crowd. They eat this shit up. Lowest common denominator. Seriously the most vile people."
'These people will do anything for a small tax cut and to piss off "Dems" and "Libs." They talk about Democrats like we\'re diseased and should die, of course they have no empathy for the bereaved and the sick.'
"America has truly lost its shame.  Regardless of a person's political position for or against you or your platform, is there no decency left?  \n\nDo these people really represent who we are?"
"Has Trump insulted Jimmy Carter yet? Because at this point he's insulted all the other former presidents AND their families."
'Just remember all these idiots who voted for him and claim to support the troops are fake patriots. supporting the troops for them usually boils down to petty shit that lends itself to false patriotism. Wearing the star and stripes, not kneeling during a game, worrying about stolen valor. Its never about making sure troops are provided for during and after war. Mental health, veteran suicides. Its never about sending them to stupid wars or proper use of defense budgeting. Its not about helping homeless vets. Its always whatever token item they can find to be outraged about to prove how patriotic they are, so that they can turn a blind eye to the rest of it. If they can put a sticker on their truck, or a meme on facebook they are much happier. If they can shout second amendment and play war on the weekends with guns and not actually ever enlisted they are happy. it boils down to being a fake patriot every time. '
"If I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times: Donald John Trump is a goddamn sack of fucking goddamn shit."
"I don't feel anything for McCain here. He paved this road to hell. As did GHWB. Trump is the logical conclusion to at least 3 or 4 decades of GOP's march further and further to the Right.\n\nTrump is just Frankenstein's Monster in all of it."
'AutoMod:\n\n>As a reminder, this subreddit is for civil discussion.\n\nTop comment gilded multiple times:\n\n>I cannot believe what bitches the Republican voters are.  These are politicians they admired.  I have been in arguments with many Republicans over criticisms of Bush 1 and McCain.  And now this two-bit wannabe Pol crackPot piece of shit with the failed hair plugs and clipon tie hanging over his shriveled pecker stands up in front of a rally of people who he is shamelessly fleecing through his ponzi scheme administration and mocks these men for things that have nothing to do with their policy *and they eat it up like hungry little guppies.*  No shame, no self-respect.  Just a bunch of bottom bitches for the pimp-in-chief.\n\nCivil discussion, amirite?'
'Surprise everyone! Ponzi-scheming Draft dodger hates war heroes.   \nAlso: President with suspicious ties to Russia gets to make secret deals with Putin.  \nLater: Republicans highly approve of all of this.'
"Trump likes to hurt people for no reason, in service to nothing. He's cruel, like a kid that pulls the wings off flies or drowns cats. He's just a profoundly ugly American, a true scumbag, just a depraved human being. And he's a fucking traitor."
'Immoral piece of shit continues to be immoral'
'...and made fun of rape victims and was racist towards native americans.'
'>\t“What does that mean? I know one thing: Make America Great Again we understand. Putting America first we understand. Thousand points of light, I never quite got that one. What the hell is that? Has anyone ever figured that one out? It was put out by a Republican wasn’t it.”\n\nTranslation: I’m too stupid to understand simple imagery. '
'>"Thousand points of light," Trump said. "What does that mean? I know one thing: Make America Great Again we understand. Putting America first we understand. Thousand points of light, I never quite got that one. What the hell is that? Has anyone ever figured that one out?

'No standards, no class. Which is what we expect now.\n\nThe fact that some people have no problem with him is disgusting.'
'When someone shows you who they are believe them...mr trump may be the most vile, blackhearted person on the planet. This is going to get way worse before it gets better.'
'Pissing everyone off then complaining about being treated oh so unfairly. Dumbass. '
'why tf is this dude holding a rally in the first place? insecure mother fucker man'

'He is just a walking disaster.  Trump is so narcissistic and arrogant, he lacks a basic understanding of how this process works. You just dont slam prominent members of your party if you want to get reelected. '
"Remember during the campaign everyone kept waiting for 'the pivot' when he would stop being the worst and make even a feeble attempt at seeming stately?\n\nWe were so young."
"I would say this is what you get when you hire a third grader to hold this office, but I taught a first grade student this year who showed more maturity, more intelligence, and a hell of a lot more empathy than this orange jackass. I'm no fan of Bush (either one) or McCain, but to mock them at their weakest is a sign of his own weakness. \n\nIn a race to the bottom, he's the guy handing out concrete shoes and 40&#37; of Americans are happy to wear them.  \n\nPlease, deal with this problem as he's causing issues in a lot more places than just the United States of America!

'Trump said he will only lose. Most transparent liar I have ever seen.'
'Fucker lied again.'
'   A little background info: My senior year in high school, I was herded into a crowded gymnasium full of little old lady\'s. It was the great mission of my social studies teacher to get everyone registered to vote. As you can imagine, this was a little chaotic and time consuming. I immediately began to panic as I could hear her going down the line of my fellow classmates, stopping at each student and asking "What are you?". The students offered quick, decisive answers. "Democrat!, Republican!" I could hear her getting closer and closer. "Shit, what do I pick.... What do I pick?" I said to myself. At the time, I felt like this decision was huge and there would be no turning back. She had finally reached me. "What are you?" She said, impatiently pressing her pen to the paper." I stood frozen, not knowing the correct response to such an important choice. I nervously said, "I just don\'t know what I want to be Mrs. B. I just want to be able pick the best one, no matter what party they are!". She smiled at me and declared loudly "independent!".\n\n   So that is what I am. I don\'t side with the donkey\'s or the elephant\'s. I pick the candidate that I agree with most, at that time. Let me be very truthful when I say I don\'t like Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump! Out of the two, I felt as if I was forced to pick the less evil. I used common sense to realize that a crooked business man has nothing in common with me. I wanted to see the swamp drained like everyone else but I certainly was not going to sit in the middle and trust an alligator do it for me! I mean c\'mon, did you REALLY buy that? Are you really going to let a car salesman talk you into a 2 door sport car when you have 4 kids and came for a minivan??!! \n   "But wait" they said. "He is gonna shake up the system". Oh it\'s shaking all right! Shaking with such force that it\'s falling apart. Between the daily news of hire this dude, fire this dude, here a lie, there a lie, everywhere a lie lie, its apparent all the shaking is going to cause us brain damage. I have a prediction and its this: In the history books Donald Trump will be noted as the most reckless president in history. His presidency will be viewed by future generations as a "what not to do" manual for future US president\'s. \n\n   As I always try to see things from both sides of an argument, I couldn\'t quite figure out why in the hell people would not be happy with tax cuts. I know why people loathe the president but how is cutting taxes not great for both sides? So I looked up just exactly what was in the bill. Now let me tell you the big words, mumbo jumbo shit can get pretty confusing. So I did the best I could to apply it all to my little "working poor" life. Here goes.    \n\n* First things first. The guys in the suits need to waive something called a "go budget rule" by today or mom and all her old ass friends are getting their Medicare cut. Let\'s hope they get that shit waived and fast.\n* I\'m pretty sure we fall into the 12%. There is a 10,000 deduction for property taxes or income taxes. Alright my taxes are not even close to 10,000 dollars and I don\'t have a business, so we can scratch this off.\n* We can have a standard deduction. The housing people will cry but it don\'t matter to me cause I\'m not buying or building a house.\n* Obama care repealed. HECK YEAH!! I\'m dropping this bullshit insurance now that I\'m not forced to have it. I should mention that I have had this tiny annoying pain in my side but whatever. In a few months it\'s going to be excruciating. I\'m going to make a trip to the ER where they realize it\'s cancer. SHIT! Its going to take many trips back and forth to the Dr\'s, my medical bills are going to pile up and well..... I just don\'t pay them. I don\'t know how these cost ever get recovered but screw it. I should also mention that the kids insurance premiums went up.\n* I don\'t exactly understand this but we have to pay higher taxes if we have kids under this bill. \n* Estate tax credit. Ha! Not gonna have to worry bout that.\n* Child tax credit. So now I\'m totally confused. We pay higher taxes if we have kids but then get it back? Got to do math. Does that mean they took it but then just gave it back?\n* 529 college savings plan. Hopefully I can stash some money away and make these little shits rich, so they can take care of me when they get older. Wait, whoa...WTF. We only get a tax break if they are home schooled or go to a religious or private school. \n* 500 bucks for taking care of mom. Has anyone ever had another aging adult live with them? They are pretty cheap aren\'t they.\n* Cooperation shit. Yadda, yadda. Skim over this section cause it has no use to me. But I will note that the credits they get, will give them cash or a fancy term called "repartitioned cash". They did the same thing in 2004 and you guessed it, the corporations just gave it to "share holders" and not the actual employees. Go figure. \n* Oil can be drilled in some Arctic wildlife refuge. So if you are all for Donald trump, I do not want to see your bullshit "end animal abuse" Facebook shit no more. Sea lions and pit bulls both deserve to live in my opinion.\n* Some cut on rare disease research. My chances of catching some African Ebola shit are slim to none, so I\'m good. Right?\n* No tax on beer. HOLY SHIT. WHAT DID I JUST READ!!!!!! FUCK YEAH! Bars and good judgment look the fuck out! Whoop whoop. Now I can actually afford to sit at the bar all day. There is a God.\n* Alright we have made it threw what\'s packed in there and by 2021 taxes will begin to increase for those making under 30,000......... OH C\'MON!! Also you poor asses, who make less than the standard deduction, well.......... you\'re shit out of luck. Maybe Walmart will let you work 24 hours??       \n \n   So, my common sense evaluation from all of this is: It\'s not bad. It\'s not good. It does absolutely nothing, for the people like me and probably people like you. It does not matter if you\'re republican, democrat, independent, or anything in between. Unless your rich, it\'s really pointless. It\'s like celebrating your bosses vacation. You can wear the party hat, smile and clap all you want but everyone knows your ass is going back to work afterwards. Let\'s face it, the middle class tax cuts will be spent on living expenses and the corporations will spend it on saving and bigger CEO bonuses. No wonder there was such a circle jerk amongst those rich fuckers on tv the other day. It makes sense now why Paul Ryan had fake tan on his lip..........\n'
'Hey college students:\n\nWhat the fuck are you doing? Go march. Go right fucking now. You have a month off from school. You are the ones with the time and tens of thousands of you also have the resources and money to do this. \n\nCollege students were the vast majority of who protested Vietnam. \n\nPut your fucking phones down and go protest this goddamn sham of a president. '
'So either he was lying or had no idea what the bill actually does. Either way, completely incompetent. '
'He’s been a liar for years. Him running for president, and now in the oval, didn’t change my opinion. The press has a very difficult job. They need to be objective, but also need to be honest. He is a cheat, a liar, a crook and above all a disgrace to the office of the presidency. Him being in the oval is the reason our country is such a flat broken system.'
"People STILL don't get this bill? Ugh.\n\nFirst of all, any and all cuts to the middle and lower classes expire after a few years, so your taxes are going to go back up.\n\nSecondly, something's going to have to pay for those tax cuts. Thus, Paul Ryan are planning to cut social security and medicare. Now, take note that all american citizens basically pay into both of those so they have good healthcare and something to retire on when they're older, so Paul Ryan and the jackass brigade are basically taking your money to pay for a permanent tax cut for the rich and private jets, but also a temporary tax cut that's there to take the appearance of benefiting the average joe, but will go away in a few years, consequentially just when democrats might be getting back into power because most (not all) republican voters don't understand long term effects and consequences, thus blaming everything that happens at that moment on the people currently in power, not on those who put out this bill in the first place.\n\nSo they're cutting taxes so they have an excuse to cut medicare and social security while letting the middle class cuts expire later anyways, thus completely screwing you.\n\nDo you get it now?"
"F****** liars lie. Can't wait until this subhuman idiot is gone."
'So how the fuck are they going to justify that he lied about this, or are they just going to actively ignore a part of our reality once again?  '

'Trump was pitched a softball the size of his ego. All he had to do was say "Nazis are bad", but he managed to fuck it up not once, but fucking twice. Now he\'s engaging in Confederate apologism. I guess treason just runs through his blood.\n\nFuck, this guy is so goddamn stupid.'
"Jesus H. Christ. This motherfucker has gone full Confederate. He's rallying the white suppremecists and spitting on Heather Heyer. \n\nFuck this scumbag. \n\n"
"I still don't get why we defend statues of confederate generals who lost a war? I mean these guys were literally enemies of America. People like Washington and others he mentioned *fought for America*. Confederates *fought against America*. That's the difference, folks. "
"He's honestly fomenting race riots here. He's throwing gasoline on this fire and stoking division. \n\nYou want an action that shows he's demonstrably unfit for office, this is it. Rather than bringing people together, he's picking sides to keep the argument going. And a girl just died this very last weekend. We all know the consequences. It's shameful."
'\n\n\n"Is George Washington next?\n\nGeorge Washington has a murky and regrettable history with regards to slavery. But he fought and risked his life in a war that founded this country, and served as the first president of the United States. \n\n\nRobert E. Lee, while also a complex historical figure, fought and was willing to die in order to destroy the this Union. \n\nCan you not see a slight distinction here?'
'An absolutely ignorant argument which is why his base will eat it up.'
"Just as a heads-up, the Lee/Washington comparison is popular among white supremacists and no one else.\n\nThese are his people. This is what he supports. Violence against minorities and violence against the left is the President's explicit goal."

'To build Trump Tower, Trump demolished the Bonwitt Teller building. The Metropolitan Museum of Art wanted the two huge rare historic Art Deco friezes on the building preserved. Trump promised to do that & to donate them to the museum, when he found out it would cause a two week delay in construction and cost $500,000, he smashed them - after the outcry he lied and he said the delay would have been months & that the [two-ton panels were “without artistic merit,”]( https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/realestate/fifth-avenue-bonwit-teller-opulence-lost.html)'
"The statues weren't even erected during the existence of the Confederacy, or hell even reconstruction.  Most of them were built as a response to the civil rights era.  \n    \nI am still awaiting a reason why Lee and Jackson deserve statues."

'Oh come the fuck on. Don\'t take him out of context:\n\n>Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You can\'t change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who\'s next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\n\nAside from the last sentence, I agree 100%. I understand fully if people don\'t want these statues in public places or in front of government buildings, but wtf don\'t destroy it. Those are still historical figures, we *have* the damned statues, let\'s just move them to a museum. He\'s right 100% on that front: you can\'t change history, but you can learn from it. Destroying and villainizing any Confederate officer to the point we want to destroy any trace of their existence isn\'t going to do any good. No, put those in a museum, explain who they were and why they acted the way they did, and ***that\'s*** how you prevent history from repeating itself. The problem with destroying the statues is that this "buries" history, even if it doesn\'t intend to. We need history to be present, even if it\'s sometimes ugly to look at.'
'How can anyone still deny that our president is a racist? This is ridiculous.'
"Oh, look! It's another day in The Darkest Timeline! I'm sure his base will eat this up. After all, he didn't coin any of those stupid phrases. He's just a dumb parrot."

'By the way, here is one of the "beautiful", "historical" statues he is defending,[ this one of disgusting racist Nathan Bedford Forrest](http://i.imgur.com/BWrGoww.jpg). '
"What is crazy is most of those statues went up during the Jim Crow Law era and the Civil Rights era - they aren't from time of the Civil War. Where are the historians??? "

Lee, the guy whose statue they were protesting the removal of, wanted the Confederacy to be removed entirely after it was defeated and for no flags or monuments to be built honoring it, in order to ensure the country did not remain divided. He lost, he accepted it, and he wished for the country to move on.\n\nFine way of honoring your supposed hero's wishes, right wingers. "
"A young woman died, but Trump is sad that *statues* can't be replaced."
'As we speak, at the behest of an executive order signed by Trump, the federal government is deciding the future of the 30 or so National Natural Monuments by choosing how much funding, if any, they will receive and how many, if any, will keep their designation as National Monuments. \n\nThese are true American monuments, incomparably beautiful stretches of our country which serve as shining beacons and welcome all souls to take in their majesty. They are the "real America" these assholes constantly tout, and Trump is deciding whether to sell them off to corporate wolves. All while he cries about the destruction of racist monuments erected to intimidate black citizens and serve as a constant reminder of their former place in society and to instill in them the fear that comes with the knowledge that the people powerful enough to commission those statues and pay for them are their elected officials. '
'These statues were mostly erected in times of resurgence of KKK. During Jim Crow. These belong in a museum or put them all in a Traitors Park like Russia did with Soviet statues. These men were traitors to their country. Why have statues in public place to them?\n\nMy ancestors were Union soldiers. 4 died at the hands of Robert E Lee in Gettysburg. \n\nThey died protecting their country against rebellious traitors! \n\n'
'The majority of these statues were erected during the early 1900s when the KKK was experiencing a resurgence in the South.  The primary significance was to signify white dominance over the black community by honoring the men who fought to keep them enslaved.\n\nTrump may find these statues to be "beautiful", but the black community is abundantly aware these memorials were erected by the same people who lynched them, whipped them, branded them, and wrote the vile, repressive Jim Crow laws.'
"I argue that the confederates were not American. The moment they seceded from the union they were no longer American. Those aren't American monuments. They are confederate monuments on American soil. \nI see no difference between a confederate monument and a monument to Hitler or Kim Jong Il."

'Foreign terrorist kills people with his car and trump calls him an “animal”. Homegrown white supremacist terrorist kills people with his car and trump says there are bad people “on both sides”. What the fuck man. '
'>To be sure, Trump did express his frustration at the slow pace of the justice system during his Cabinet meeting, saying the nation needed **"to come up with a punishment that\'s far quicker and far greater than the punishment these animals are getting right now."**\n\nThat\'s frightening as hell.'
"Sorry, but the White House denying objective facts isn't news. I'm glad that their BS is being called out, but it's par for the course now. Which is really disheartening."
'Can articles just start calling this what it is: lying. They are lying no to your face. Start using the word.'
"This is a dystopia. It really is. Every person who has supported this shit show is basically admitting that lying doesn't matter as long as it's a a lie in their favor. We are watching the slow motion collapse of our society. We have no future if we can't even agree on a basic set of verifiable, observable, facts"
'\xa0"to come up with a punishment that\'s far quicker and far greater than the punishment these animals are getting right now."\n\nAs a German I have to say, America watch out!\nCalling people animals, no matter if they are psychopathic murderers, is a classic fascist move. Because once you introduce this form of dehumanization and people get use to it, you can start applying it to other groups. Same thing Trump\'s son did saying he stopped seeing Democrats as people. This it\'s really scary and worries me as much as the blatant lying!'
"Does it annoy anyone else that sanders doesn't just obviously deny basic things, but is constantly trying to pull a face as if to suggest that the questioner is possibly slightly deranged? She spends so much time shaking her head and grimacing and appealing to an imaginary audience that it must be exhausting. "
'I don\'t condone violence, and I never would hurt a woman, but holy shit Sarah Huckabee Sanders has the most punchable face I\'ve ever seen.  Her dismissive "can\'t be bothered with facts" approach makes me so seething mad.'
'To me the bigger issue is the wholesale trashing of radicalized people as "animals" or sub-human or monsters. No one comes out of the womb chanting "allah akbar", or donning a klan robe, etc. Every human starts as a blank slate, and for the President to suggest anyone is an animal or not worthy of humanity is disgusting, anti-Enlightment, and anti-American.'
"I think that , in the future as we try to recover from this laughingstock in the White House, there needs to be some kind of check on the Press Secretary.\n\nI know she's supposedly speaking for the president, but she's still a part of the executive branch.  Our government becomes a laughingstock and a step closer to the void when the executive branch can lie with impunity.\n\nYou can argue that all politicians not under oath are free to lie with impunity, but, seriously, we've gone from politicians 'heavily spinning' to lying in the face of damning evidence that they are lying.\n\nLetting this go, in turn, reinforces the la la dreamworld that their supporters live in.  \n\nYou should be punished for lying.  These punitive measures should be common as long as lying is common.\n\n3 lies earns you a suspension or some such.  More lies=longer suspension.\n\nNot only is there a punishment for lying, but this establishes a formal record of it.  Come election time, this should then matter to rational citizens who are not part of the White House laughingstock."
'It\'s amusing watching the Republican panelists on CNN come on and say "But he never said that! He never said--!!" only to be interrupted by Anderson Cooper "Let\'s cut to the video of him saying exactly that."\n\nThe face they make is one of utter defeat and shame. There\'s no possible way to backpedal from such indefensible positions. They just resign themselves to their fates. It\'s hilarious.\n\nAs an aside note, I find it amusing that Trump thinks the US justice system is a laughingstock. The perp is in jail and will probably never see the light of day ever again - how exactly did the justice system fail here? If you ask me, it\'s working fine. Okay, so he wants to send people suspected of terrorism to Gitmo - but then he\'s moving America away from our constitutional justice system which has been the model for 1st world nation across the globe. Even if they committed heinous crimes, they still have the right to a fair trial. You can\'t just inter people into camps in peacetime because you suspect them of being terrorists - that\'s delving into thoughtcrime.\n\nThe real laughingstock here is Trump and his goons. The fact that he thinks stricter law enforcement is the key to stopping terrorism is like the cherry on top. Ancient empires that spanned the known world tried to fight terrorism and collapsed while trying. He\'s not some genius who just now had some epiphany that nobody else could have possibly come up with.'
'It’s getting real irritating that this White House can just lie openly and obviously without any repercussions, hell they impeached Clinton for lying about a personal issue the lies they spout are vindictive and sometimes dangerous on a international level'
'This is what happens when there are no consequences to lying. They do this over and over again and the worst they get out of it is a news article.'
'Now FOX News has an article saying that Mueller is using Papa\'s guilty plea over his head and squeezing him as a witness to give him the information he "wants to hear" about Trump\'s collusion. It\'s fucking infuriating.\n\nThey realize that Trump is guilty as sin so now they\'re trying to spin it that Mueller is threatening witnesses illegally to fabricate evidence. Cancer, the lot of them.'
'I’m sick of her.  At least you could see Spicey’s soul screaming from the basement.'
'Speaking of a joke legal system.  Trump just tweeted the terror suspect in NYC should get the death penalty.  There is now concern he could taint the jury pool and force a mistrial.'

'From an email Cohn sent as featured in Fire and Fury:\n\n>It’s worse than you can imagine. An idiot surrounded by clowns. Trump won’t read anything – not one-page memos, not the brief policy papers; nothing. He gets up halfway through meetings with world leaders because he is bored. And his staff is no better. Kushner is an entitled baby who knows nothing. Bannon is an arrogant prick who thinks he’s smarter than he is. Trump is less a person than a collection of terrible traits. No one will survive the first year but his family. I hate the work, but feel I need to stay because I’m the only person there with a clue what he’s doing. The reason so few jobs have been filled is that they only accept people who pass ridiculous purity tests, even for midlevel policy-making jobs where the people will never see the light of day.”'
'Wow, this is a big deal resignation. One of the professionals, and not one of the completely batshit bizarros.\n\nIt\'ll be interesting to see how the markets react this time.\n\n**Edit:** [Stock futures point to sharply lower opening after Wall Street-friendly Cohn resigns](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/06/stock-futures-point-to-sharply-lower-opening-after-wall-street-friendly-cohn-resigns.html)\n\n**Note:** this almost certainly means Trump is hellbent on further alienating US allies via his dumbass tariffs.\n\n**Note:** earlier today Trump tweeted, "[The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House.

'No love lost for Cohn here, but the shock over firings and resignations is actually growing. This is not normal. This is not okay. At some point, one would expect the admin to level off; instead, the descent deepens. '
"Rough day for Trump's staff and alum: Cohn resigns. Kellyanne was found to have violated the Hatch Act. Cohen is implicated in Mueller's investigation. Nunberg is hungover."
"FFS - this means Trump isn't backing down on tariffs, doesn't it?"
'When he attacked the women, I said nothing, because I wasn’t a woman. \n\nWhen he sided with the white nationalists, I said nothing because I wasn’t a white nationalist. \n\nBut when he threatened tariffs, I left, because there are somethings man just cannot bare.'
"No chaos, no chaos! You're the chaos!"
'Hmmm were Tariffs worst than White Supremacists? '

"> “What would happen if the president didn’t follow my orders,” she asked Wang.\n\nIt's weird that when her attorney asked the judge to order Trump to give a deposition, the judge asked the attorney this question, as if it was a possible excuse to not order it.\n\nI mean, I get that it's a legitimate concern that Trump might ignore a judge's lawful orders (duh), but that's a problem for the judge, our entire justice system, and the country as a whole to tackle. The fear that someone might disobey a lawful order should never dissuade a judge from issuing it."
'"“What would happen if the president didn’t follow my orders,” she asked Wang.\n\n“I don’t believe that … will occur,” Wang said.\n\n“I hope not,” the judge added."\n\nIsn\'t it the court\'s problem if the president disregards its order? That is, not the responsibility of the person or their counsel seeking justice through the court? I can\'t help but wonder why this question would even come up from the judge during proceedings, as if counsel has to come up with an explanation for how the system should work if the executive branch decides to start ignoring the courts. Are jurists openly speculating that Trump will declare himself beyond the law? \n\nPerhaps the judge is pondering and acknowledging that there is nothing the court can do to enforce the law, and that the law therefore depends on unenforceable norms, like voluntary cooperation from those in power.\n\nAlways reassuring to a society just barely restrained from violence and chaos by the rule of law.'
'His base will argue. That as president he’s allowed to sexually assault anyone. '
"I'm as far as it gets from a Trump supporter but I am not sure how much I want to be setting a precedent that the president can be bogged down in lawsuits as a tactic to prevent them from getting things done. To be clear I'm not saying that's why he's being sued but it would open the door for that.  I wouldn't have wanted Obama spending all his time in court due to people suing him over a fake birth certificate or something.  I'm open to reasons to the contrary though."
'The judge\'s comment was troubling. I\'m sure she\'s in a rough spot, but we can\'t just say "the defendant might ignore this so let\'s give them a pass" ESPECIALLY if it\'s the president.\n\nI don\'t envy her position.'

'Jesus Christ his lawyers are pieces of shit. Trump isn’t *half* the man Jefferson was. Even if we pretend he is, [Trump isn’t treating the presidency as a 24/7 job](http://www.newsweek.com/trump-white-house-clinton-638448) so that argument is dog shit. '
">But Trump’s attorney, Marc Kasowitz, argued presidents are immune from civil litigation in state courts under the US Constitution’s supremacy clause. That assertion has never been fully tested by the courts.\n\nwell unfortunately trumps lawyers are probably right. Clinton wasnt as brazen, but there is nothing but the threat of impeachment to compel trump to follow the judges orders. There are no 'police' above trump to arrest and force the issue. I'm not sure if even scotus could order him to attend since there are no one with the power to compel a sitting president.(no cop with the authority and the AG sure as fuck wouldnt do it)\n\nof course clinton had an opposing congress. Trump does not. I suppose, perhaps the judge could summarily rule against him for refusal to show if she ordered it but i dont see the method to force him without a congress willing to impeach.(or a cabinet willing to overthrow him under the 25th by declaring him unfit.)\n"
">Summer Zervos is suing Trump for calling her a liar after she accused him of “thrusting his genitals at her and grabbing her breasts” — the groping accusation came just weeks before the 2016 election.\n\nSuper convenient, considering it supposedly happened in 2007 huh? No lawsuits before then, but all of a sudden he's running for Pres and she decides to sue, lol. So fake"

"This shooting happened in my home town.  \n\nI've been crying on and off since yesterday. My community has been shattered by this event. One of the kids killed was a distant relative of mine, and I know faculty and students personally who witnessed the event.  My own mother works at the hospital where these kids were being transferred. She called me last night and could barely get a word out while she was crying. \n\nThe shooter was a white kid who was heavily bullied, who's father had passed away the day before.  If anything, I would expect Melania to say something since fighting bullying is her First Lady's agenda.  Nothing has been said, though. Just brush it under the rug with all the other school shootings and lets do nothing to acknowlege it.  Why can't our goverment acknowlege the problem?!  Why is funneling money into their pockets more important than the citizens of the country they were elected to represent!? \n\n\nThanks to the Canadian Prime Minister for showing some humanity. I am glad someone cares. "
'trump has yet to publicly acknowledge the 21 people killed in the mudslide two weeks ago. '
"Spoiler: He literally doesn't care. Acknowledging it will not benefit him personally so why bother?"
'This asshole can tweet every time a thought hits his tiny brain, but he can\'t even offer "thoughts and prayers" over this awful incident? You people asking, does he have to respond to every mass shooting? Um...yes. Yes he does, even if it\'s just a lousy tweet. '
"If it was a Muslim, Trump would have made 200 tweets about it by now.  He is a racist, it's that simple"
"School shooting and shootings where lots of people die isn't really worthy of Presidential comment anymore because such incidents are so common. \n\nVegas is way back in the rearview mirror. That thing that happened at the little Church in Texas? Out of the news cycle. Yesterday's incident? Gone by tomorrow afternoon. \n\nIt's better that Trump says nothing because he'd fuck it up anyway. \n\nThat kids are killed in school is so horrifying that a sane society would do something about it. \n\nWe do nothing. \n\nAnd to have the sleaziest piece of shit to have ever walked through the doors of the White House blubber his way through some half-assed comment while inevitably managing to insult our intelligence simply isn't necessary. "
'In every way imaginable, he is the absolute worst. '
"Look, if Trump had to stop everything to acknowledge school shootings, that would be like 50-55 tweets a year.  He can't fit that into his packed schedule of golfing and rage tweeting from the toilet."
"A white, non-Islamic, non-mentally ill shooter does not fit Trump's narrative, so of course he is going to remain silent about it."
"Like sex scandals and WH staffers talking shit about each other, this barely registers on my Fucktrumpometer.\n\nI'm pretty sure what he does or doesn't say is of fuck-all importance to the parents of the victims and the community at large. Neither acknowledgement by Trump nor his silence will make things any better, but given his attitude saying anything could very easily make things worse. All it takes is one shitty, insensitive comment from him, and 24 hours later Hannity will be attacking the character of the shooting victims in a desperate ploy to defend Trump.\n\nAll I care about is (a) Mueller's team ending his presidency or, failing that, (b) Democrats obstructing him *and* Congressional Republicans until Dems take over the House and Senate."
"Isn't that how karma works?  He has to ignore a real violent event in Kentucky to balance out [having made one up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Green_massacre)."

'Remember when Obama got all that shit for not saying the right degree of words to announce the tragedy in Benghazi?\n\nWell at least he made *AN* announcement!'

"You're all missing the point, Fox didn't block her because of the potential Trump/Russia connection, they blocked her because she wanted to do investigative journalism. They can't have some rogue employee out there doing actual journalism besmirching the ~~good~~ shit name of Fox News. Besides, that's what Shep is for. "
"The largest news source in America is blocking journalistic inquiry into the darkest political hour in our nation's history. Let that sink in.\n\nMakes sense, I guess. They turned out the lights. "
"Fox and Breitbart should be removed from the whitelist for blatant propaganda. I mean, they won't with the mods here being fine with outright racism from white list sources. "
'News Corp is a treasonous organization.\nWhen does willfully misleading the population of a nation cross over into treason?'
"Although to us cynical lay persons this isn't surprising at all, to actual journalists this is a gigantic outrage and any real journalist would be incredibly insulted at even the insinuation that their news organization prevented them from chasing a real story for reasons of political bias. They positively bristle at the suggestion. And here's a reporter at a major national org coming right out and saying that's exactly what happens. That's like a a sous chef at a Michelin starred restaurant admitting people spit in the food there. It's like a teacher saying administrators at her school abuse children. It's hard to overstate how much of an outrage this actually is even if us cynical lay persons aren't even surprised."
'fox has just gotten worse as time goes on.\n\n\ngood thing they are fair and balanced.. hey i know they lean a bit right, but at least they arent breitbart.. oh wait i guess they are.\n\nIt would be different if fox just spun things a little right, like msnbc does sometimes a little left(but with pundits only)\n\nbut its not good enough for them, they actually have to control the story. MSNBC which many consider the lefts fox, would never do such a thing.\n\n\ngood thing pai is getting rid of ownership restrictions of the murdochs of the world can fuck up even your local paper.'
"With as much stonewalling, lying, smoke screens, and distracting the Right is doing, you know they are guilty as sin and Mueller has them right in his crosshairs. These roaches are scrambling. We're watching a boxer with weak knees and his back against the ropes trying to make limp-wristed swings at a target it can't hit. It'd be hilarious if it wasn't so sad. "
'I can\'t decide of its funny or terrifying that fox can stir up the Republican base enough to distrust credible sources because they think it\'s just "liberal media", while ignoring this kind of political bias. It\'s funny because of the stupidity of the base, but it\'s also terrifying... Because of the stupidity of the base. '

'"When you\'re attacking FBI agents because you\'re under criminal investigation, you\'re losing." -Huckleberry Sanders '
"Remember, Trump'officially' fired Comey because he was unfair to Clinton."
"Man, how I'm sick of this Republican victimhood:\n\n* FBI and Justice investigating the President? They hate Republicans\n* The American Bar Association says your judicial picks are unqualified? [The ABA hates Republicans.](http://dailycaller.com/2017/11/21/bigoted-the-american-bar-association-is-blackballing-trumps-judicial-nominees-for-their-beliefs/)\n* The Congressional Budget Office scores your healthcare bill in a negative light?

"[When you're attacking FBI agents because you're under criminal investigation, you're losing -Sarah Huckabee Sanders](https://mobile.twitter.com/sarahhuckabee/status/794255968448020480?lang=en)"
"All of this shit is the exact reason why Comey reopened the email investigation. He mentioned that (not in his exact words) the Republicans are whiney fucks who will start endless drama after the election if it's found out the FBI knew there were more emails and didn't say anything before the election.\n\nIt's pretty embarrassing when Republicans at the FBI and DoJ know their own politicians are worse than Democrats."
'At some point we have to put the blame on the people that enable this shitshow to keep going. \n\nRon Johnson - Secret societies guy investigating FBI agents\n\nPaul Ryan - sucking Ann Rands dead body\n\nWhat does this say about the judgment of the people of Wisconsin?\n\nFuck Wisconsin and their voters. Fucking assholes, screwing the whole country for their selfish greed. You are from Wisconsin you ought to be fucking ashamed of yourself this morning. \n'
'It fucking boggles me that the right has figured out a way to completely paint such a fucking weird picture of our intelligence community.\n\nFirst, that people let their personal political beliefs dictate their actions to the point of every action being done to partisan effect is psychological projection. Comey was not partisan. Mueller, Rosenstein, McCabe - not partisan. But **everything** Trump and the Republican party is doing has been 100% partisan - Trump seeks to destroy Obama\'s legacy and the GOP seeks to de-legitimize the left\'s *right* to govern, period. So clearly, anyone who speaks out against them, or does not aid and abet this effort, is an enemy, and most be removed, by any means.\n\nThat, in and of itself, is a dangerous precedent. We live in a time where a party has now become a faction, and that faction is eroding the edges of our democracy in an effort to consolidate and maintain power. That is political terrorism. \n\nAnd before you say, "But that\'s hyperbole!" I\'ll just state that **terrorism is the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.** It is clear that many of the actions taken by this administration and its faction are *not* lawful.\n\nYou have a leadership arm of the GOP that has been taken over by men who are complicit on violence, who encourage intimidation, and who seek hostile takeovers of the very agencies that are there to protect our national security.\n\nSo of course the ONLY reason that the DOJ would oppose Trump is because of the notion that there\'s this...deep state conspiracy run by a shadow government that\'s aided by our intelligence agencies, and has somehow co-opted the very men he placed in power there. And it must be super powerful to have done so, especially since it only very recently was created - since the end of the Obama administration. And this \'Deep State\', which is run not only by a considerable amount of conservatives *as well as* military leaders, somehow *favors* Democrats over Republicans, and wants to depose Trump and/or Republican congressional leadership.\n\nHow is this not the most fucking bonkers narrative?'

'Is this another Twitter thing?\n\nFolks.  At some point we\'re going to have to recognize that the controversial things the President posts to Twitter are intentionally controversial.  It\'s bait.  It\'s all bait.  And for some reason, the news media, the Democrats, the casual consumer of information, we\'re all biting.\n\nPlease understand, I\'m not suggesting that the President is engaging in some sort of multi-dimensional chess match, the way his supporters seem to think.  Donald Trump is observably stupid.  But stupidity doesn\'t preclude a sort of simple cunning sharpened from his days as a television personality: controversy means eyeballs and even bad news is still news.  Whether it\'s a desire to hear his own name on television or because it\'s distracting from the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in our elections doesn\'t really matter.\n\nBecause even if Donald Trump isn\'t smart enough to work the room, so to speak, his party most certainly is.  Watch how the Democrats and some of the newspapers latched on to his lies about viewership numbers for the State of the Union.  While everyone rushes, breathless, to accuse him of lying, the GOP can sit back and point fingers and say, "Look how petty the other side is; why are they so focused on ratings?"  You think your intentions in pointing out the President\'s inaccurate viewership numbers actually make a dent in their narrative?  They don\'t.\n\n**Democrats:** you\'re fumbling what should be an easy win.  You\'re UGA in the National Championship, the Falcons in last year\'s Super Bowl.  All you have to do is ignore the President when he tweets obviously incendiary things.  Petulantly sitting down during every applause line at the State of the Union was... well, petulant.  Better to have stood, provided a blank affect, perfunctorily clapped, and sat down, then fuel the GOP\'s narrative of sour grapes.  Stop giving in to outrage at every thing he does.  If everything is outrageous, nothing is, and your complaints fall on deaf ears.  You should be building actual, tangible legislation you can trot out as a response to the current GOP\'s bizarre and haphazard dismantling of the federal government.  You should be focusing on concrete issues.  Look to Danica Roem for the roadmap to winning an election.\n\n**Mainstream Media:** You\'re fucking up worse than the Democrats.  Every time you cover Donald Trump\'s endless tide of Twitter inanity, you give Fox News one more reason to deride your coverage as biased.  I realize the DOJ has decided the President\'s tweets are official statements; that\'s sort of immaterial.  They\'re tweets, they\'re usually venal and stupid, and more often than not, inaccurate.  Why in the good fuck would you cover that?  It\'s not news, no one\'s surprised, and there are plenty of things happening in this country that deserve the attention of the viewing public.  Do those stories.  You pull the coverage of Donald Trump\'s temper tantrums, you remove all of their power.\n\nTL;DR: This is insanity.  Stop reacting to Donald Trump\'s obvious bait.\n\n**Edit:** Uh oh, I strike a nerve with someone? :)\n\n**Edit 2:** I\'m dumbfounded by how controversial saying "don\'t feed the troll" is.\n\n**Edit 3:** Someone rightly called me out for using a religious epithet. That\'s been removed.'
'Has anyone read Trump supporter comments on various news sites? They want to throw FBI agents into Gitmo.

"I don't know if people understand how serious this really is. The FBI is about as Republican an institution as exists in the U.S. government.\n\nGeorge W. Bush made a point of packing as many Republican-leaning people into the FBI before he left office as possible. The FBI has a tradition of acting professionally, agnostic to political leaning, but the fact is that the FBI is comprised of right-leaning individuals. Try for a second to imagine the FBI agent at the regional office who is a vocal Hillary Clinton supporter. You can't. Because that's how Republican the culture is.\n\nJames Comey is a Republican.\n\nRobert Mueller is a Republican.\n\nThe current Republican congress, and the Trump administration, are not being partisan in the traditional sense. They are extremists who are intent on destroying the former right-wing establishment in the U.S.A. and replacing it with something even farther right, where our nation's basic principles of democracy no longer apply. And they are winning."
"If the FBI and the DOJ are being attacked because of a stupid memo, written after it was discovered by a Fuckboi (Nunes) that a different Fuckboi (Page) was under surveillance, then obviously Page has something major to hide. Carter Page might be Stupid Watergate's Howard Hunt!\n\nAlso, let's not forget that this memo (3~4 pages) was written by a guy with no background in intelligence, based on a secret FISA warrant he never saw (running into 50~60 pages at least), which he then passed around touting as proof that the intelligence community is misusing its powers to target people from a particular party (Page had been looked into for years, for being a Russian spy, which was actually caught as a few years ago). He then proceeded to stop himself from releasing the memo. He then gave a further edited copy (without the House Intelligence Committee's approval, the fuck?) to the White House, to get their backing for a release. The FBI (in a very rare statement) says not to release it because it's partisan as fuck, omits information to make the FBI look bad as points are taken out of context, and threatens peoples trust in the system and how it works. So the White House comes out swinging in support of this memo, which the Democrats say was written with no input from them, and should not be trusted. And now, we're on the verge of the release of this thing, which could bring down the head of the FBI (who Trump himself appointed), all because Carter Page is hiding something. "

'If there is anyone here who seriously thinks the FBI has a leftwing bias, go read up on COINTELPRO or how all the Church commission reforms were thrown out after 9/11 to spy on anti-Iraq War activists.'
'He\'s not just saying the FBI and Justice Department *were* doing that, he\'s saying they *are* doing that. The fucking idiot appointed Christopher Wray and Jeff Sessions. \n\nThis is getting so absurd. Remember it was only last year - less than a year ago! - when Comey was fired and Trump tried to claim he was simply following Rosenstein\'s recommendation, which was partially made because Comey was allegedly "too harsh" on Hillary Clinton. Now Rosenstein\'s in the crosshairs, and Trump is still slamming both departments for going too easy on her.\n\nTrump is a fucking menace to our Democracy, our law enforcement agencies, and the rule of law. And Republicans are just enabling him because they know undermining all three of those things is the only way they can win elections anymore.\n\nTo quote what Adam Schiff said the other day: *"There is nothing that Russia can do that rivals what we are doing to ourselves."*\n\nSeriously, how much longer before we take to the streets and stay there - grind this country to a halt - until Congress is forced to remove this guy? Are we *really* going to wait until Trump fires Mueller to try it? We need to do something *fast*; he needs to be removed! \n'

'Link is dead.\n\n#Here is a mirror: http://archive.is/M5Wdl\n\nWith no explanation, the White House has terminated members of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS amid widespread discontent with President Trump’s approach to the epidemic.\n\nAfter six members of PACHA resigned in June, the White House on Wednesday terminated the remaining 16 members without explanation via a letter from FedEx.\n\nScott Schoettes, a Chicago-based HIV/AIDS activist and senior attorney for Lambda Legal, was one of the six who resigned in June over Trump’s inaction on HIV/AIDS and said on Twitter the remaining members were fired.\n\n“No respect for their service,” Schoettes said. “Dangerous that #Trump and Co. (Pence esp.) are eliminating few remaining people willing to push back against harmful policies, like abstinence-only sex ed.”\n\n> Remaining #HIV/AIDS council members booted by @realDonaldTrump. No respect for their service. Dangerous that #Trump and Co. (Pence esp.) are eliminating few remaining people willing to push back against harmful policies, like abstinence-only sex ed. #WeObject #PACHA6 #Resist\n\n> — Scott A. Schoettes (@PozAdvocate) December 28, 2017\n\nOne source with knowledge of PACHA said many council members were terminated even though additional time remained on their terms as advisers.\n\nGabriel Maldonado, CEO of the Riverside, Calif.,-based LGBT and HIV/AIDS group Truevolution, was a remaining member of PACHA and confirmed they were fired, but said the “explanation is still unclear.”\n\n“I can only speculate,” Maldonado said. “Like any administration, they want their own people there. Many of us were Obama appointees. I was an Obama appointee and my term was continuing until 2018.”\n\nMaldonado said “ideological and philosophical differences” with the administration are a potential reason for the terminations.\n\nAs an example, Maldonado cited a recent Washington Post report the Centers for Disease Control is banned from using words like “diversity” and “transgender” in budge documents. The CDC director has denied those words are banned.\n\n“I was co-chair of the disparities committee, so much of my advocacy and policy references surrounded vulnerable populations, addressing issuing of diverse communities, specifically looking at the impacts of the LGBT community, namely, the disproportionate impact of HIV and AIDS to people of color, gay men, transgender women,” Maldonado said. “And a lot of those key vulnerable populations are not being prioritized in this administration.”\n\nMaldonado added he intends to publish an open letter to the community about his termination on Friday.\n\nCreated in 1995, PACHA has provided advice starting in the Clinton administration and into the George W. Bush and Obama administrations on policy and research to promote effective treatment and prevention for HIV — maintaining the goal of finding a cure.\n\nIn September, Trump signed an executive order that renewed PACHA along with 31 other presidential bodies for an additional year.\n\nTrump’s termination of council members isn’t a first time an administration cleaned house on PACHA. The Obama administration eliminated all of George W. Bush’s appointees before making new appointments.\n\nBut Maldonado said the termination of PACHA members during the Trump administration is only partially consistent with the Obama years.\n\n“It is common for appointees to be terminated and for folks to kind of want their own people in,” Maldonado said. “I think where the discrepancy comes in is why a year later, No. 1? Two, many of us, our terms were over earlier this year and we were sworn back in, and three were stayed on nearly four months after an executive order was signed continuing the council.”\n\nIn June, six members of the PACHA resigned the posts in protest over what they called inaction from Trump on the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. An estimated 1.2 million people have HIV/AIDS in the United States and 37 million have the disease worldwide.\n\nChief among the reasons was the absence of leadership at the White House on HIV/AIDS. To this date, the White House has yet to appoint a director of the Office of National AIDS Policy, which was one of the reasons the six members of PACHA resigned in June.\n\nTrump’s fiscal year 2018 budget proposal also sought massive cuts to HIV/AIDS programs, including $150 million on HIV/AIDS programs at the Centers of Disease Control and more than $1 billion in cuts from global programs like PEPFAR Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis & Malaria. The Republican-controlled Congress has thus far continued to fund these programs at previous levels.\n\nMaldonado noted the PACHA terminations are taking place at the year’s end after the June resignations, which he said is “a little too coincidental.”\n\n“The timing is a little bit unorthodox compared to what the Obama administration’s approach was,” Maldonado said.\n\nMaldonado said he represented a younger demographic on PACHA as the only member under the age of 30, which he said is where the majority of new HIV infections are occurring, and as a young, black gay man.\n\n“I just am coming to the acknowledgment that the traditional tactics of politicking and policy and strategy and negotiation, the kind of standard tools that we’re trying to use, that the status quo is no longer acceptable,” Maldonado said. “The tactics that we had are kind of obsolete, and now we need to craft new strategy to address the troubling and unsettling revelations, particularly around the silence and inaction that have taken place around HIV and AIDS.”\n\nSince the resignations in June, Trump has made public statements on HIV/AIDS consisting of proclamations on National HIV Testing Day and World AIDS Day. Neither statement includes a explicit mention of LGBT people, who are considered to have face the brunt of the disease.\n\nThe White House didn’t immediately respond to a request to comment Thursday evening on the terminations.\n\nNew appointments may be coming soon. The Washington Blade reported in October gay Republicans familiar with HIV/AIDS issues and LGBT people have been among those contacted by a Trump administration official for possible appointments to PACHA.'
'This is just evil, no two ways about it.'
"HIV/AIDS is considered a western conspiracy by the Russian government, don't they literally have propaganda they put out about this ? \n\nTrump probably believes it too. That's the only explanation I can think of for him firing these people. "

'On a Friday afternoon.\n\nYeah fucking right.  So we\'re left with two possibilities:\n\n1. He\'s an amoral douchenozzle\n\n2. The star of "the apprentice" knows exactly jack shit about TV ratings\n\n/por que no los dos'
"This is beyond fucked. And what ratings is he even talking about, Fox?\n Because his polling numbers won't see a bump up from this. "
'And fucking Texas helped vote this mother fucker into office too. Fuck you too Trump.'
'How are people so stupid as to tolerate this crap? '
"Worried more about TV Ratings than the Pardon itself and/or the Hurricane and the devastation it's causing. Sadly, I cannot say I'm surprised by this admission in the slightest. "
"He's a small, pathetic, evil little man"
'Jesus fucking christ. TV Ratings > Human life. What a real piece of shit and I apologize to most of the pieces of shit that people take.'

'That was part of a long rant of disasters where he somehow saved us, yet he is too dense to see the irony that they were all related (somewhat) to climate change. Dang the POTUS is ignorant. '
'As a Puerto Rican I would like a to say a few words about our President and his choice of words on Puerto Rico. Fuck him, fuck his administration, fuck his supporters. '
'To the surprise of what should be absolutely no one, that speech had minor shreads of tough to confirm claims and the rest bold faced lies.\n\nIt had zero credibility, the moments that were supposed to be heart felt came off utterly disingenuous.. I could not dislike all these people any more. \n\nthey are cronies, liars, sellouts. Worst form of corrupt politicians possible.'

"This motherfucker is the sole reason why sodium chloride solution is on a massive shortage.  It's produced in Puerto Rico.  I have 50 vials and 100 IV bags left.  Once those are done, I'm not sure how they're gonna reconstitute the vials of meds needed for the patients.\n\nI seriously hope Mueller ruins him, his family, and his cabinet members and the GOP. "
"This shit is straight up Orwellian double-speak. It's scary what these people think they can get away with"
"Orange fascist pig. Can't wait to celebrate his hopefully soon to arrive obesity induced heart attack. Fuck him, and fuck his band of whores and thieves he calls family and friends. "
"I give zero fucks about trump voters in despair over the government's natural disaster response. It's your government you so badly wanted. It is yours. This whole bullshit message of unity falls on deaf ears after the tremendous shit show you put us through. No reasonable independent and Democrat voter would feel empathy after the shit you put us through every day for a year. Every god damn day it's fucking a pornstar while married to a pregnant wife or childish twitter at government employees, or admitting to some other illegal shit. Fuck you people."
"Again, this not only proves that Trump is all lies, but that he simply doesn't care about his own home country. Puerto Rico is still part of the US. I honestly feel bad for you Americans. At least here in Europe, we have leaders who care for out interests. "

">Mr. Nader is cooperating with the inquiry, and investigators have questioned numerous witnesses in Washington, New York, Atlanta, Tel Aviv and elsewhere about what foreign help may have been pledged or accepted, and about whether any such assistance was coordinated with Russia, according to witnesses and others with knowledge of the interviews.\n\nThis is the same Nader who was stopped and questioned by the FBI as soon as his flight landed in America a couple months ago [as per this NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/george-nader-russia-uae-special-counsel-investigation.html). Mueller and his team had a warrant for his electronic equipment when they stopped him... he's been cooperating with the investigation for months now.\n\nHoly shit, Mueller needs to hurry up because this was already bad, but it's apparently so much worse than the public knows. This article seems to be leading us down the path that the recent decision to decertify the Iran Nuclear Deal was a quid pro quo with the Saudi and Emirati governments. How long until we find out he colluded with China as well? "
"> After the election, he [Prince] worked with the crown prince to arrange a meeting in the Seychelles between Mr. Prince and a financier close to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.\n\nWow. **Seems to contradict Prince's testimony *under oath* that the Seychelles meeting.** Prince testified it was not pre-planned, which the NYTimes now on record disputing.\n\nFrom [Prince's testimony](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IG/IG00/20171130/106661/HHRG-115-IG00-Transcript-20171130.pdf):\n  \n> On or around January 11, 2017, I traveled to the Seychelles to meet with some potential customers from the UAE for the logistics business of which I am chairman. After the meeting, they mentioned a guy I should meet who was also in town to see them, A Kirill Dmitriev from Russia, who ran some sort of hedge fund. [....] I've **had no communications or dealings** with him or any of his colleagues **before or after** than encounter last January. \n\nThat is a crime. One which Mueller has charged others with already."

"> By then, a company connected to Mr. Zamel [an Israeli social media specialist] had been working on a proposal for a covert multimillion-dollar online manipulation campaign to help elect Mr. Trump, according to three people involved and a fourth briefed on the effort. The plan involved using thousands of fake social media accounts to promote Mr. Trump’s candidacy on platforms like Facebook.\n\n\n> There were concerns inside the company, Psy-Group, about the plan’s legality, according to one person familiar with the effort. The company, whose motto is “shape reality,” consulted an American law firm, and was told that it would be illegal if any non-Americans were involved in the effort.\n\nYou can't make this shit up. \n\n"
"This is a huge deal, yes?\n\nWhat's so depressing is that the GOP is basically a criminal organization at this point that has zero interest in a functional government, and the stupid Democrats have their eyes off the prize because they are arguing about Progressive versus moderate dems as our country's democracy falls apart."
'I absolutely understand why Russia wanted Trump in office.\n\nBut what was the motivation for these other countries? Did they just want a president they could bribe? Or did they just want to harm the US by putting an incompetent person at the helm?'
'The bottom line in all of this is not Trump being easily used or selling off the US, but what the fuck was the FBI doing sitting on the sidelines with all these foreign connections during the campaign ????'
"Doesn't matter is you are a Republican or a Democrat or an Independent..... Trump is a humiliation  to this nation and has killed off our credibility. "

"Clearly he's lying right Trumpers?\n\nBecause the first thing a guy who had to take a plea deal for lying to investigators would do is lie again to them. \n\nNot to mention he likely had to prove it. They didn't need to give him a plea deal. "
"Donald Trump remembered this dude by name and his name is PAPADOPOLOUS! Seriously Trump couldn't remember who Frederick Douglass was, how many amendments there are, A dead soldiers name, or what day of the week it is. But he knows remembers a name like Papadopoulos. \n\nLow level volunteer my black ass. "
"Yea, but didn't you hear?  Bill Clinton's penis colluded with Monica Lewinski's mouth, and that's WAY worse! /s"
"All I know is the President sent a tweet yesterday to let us know that Papadopoulos is a liar.  And you know, if you can't trust Donald Trump, who can you trust?\n\n/s"
'Trump supporters are now raging about the truck attack in Manhattan and trying to discredit Mueller. Russian shills have their fingers deep in since no one is buying the Uranium 1 "scandal" and they need some other thing t try and distract the public from the legitimate, unabashed corruption oozing out of the White House like a plague. '
'>It’s unclear whether Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was merely boasting when he sent the July 14, 2016, email to a Kremlin-linked contact. There’s also no indication such a meeting ever occurred.'
"The Trump supporter excuses have become so lame lately. I mean, they used to simply call it fake news or nothing burgers, but now they are backed into a corner and trying to use rational arguments. And they expect everyone to just be okay with the fact they've been a bunch of irrational, biased poo flingers for the past 9 months. \n\n\nThere's a word that represents this best...I think it's...SAD."
'Papadopoulos did some shady ass shit. Actively conspiring w Russians, knowing of but not reporting stolen emails, etc. If Mueller cut him a deal for just lying to the FBI, imagine the kind of fucked up shit the higher ups did. '
'I find it hard to believe Manafort and Gates are facing their only charges. Mueller had to file these charges now to avoid statute of limitation. I hope he’s working diligently on treason charges. This President sure seems deserving of it and none of these mother fuckers seem smart so the case should be easy. '
"Patiently waiting for someone to finger Trump specifically, all hell would break loose at that very moment. If Trump supporters wanted chaos this whole time they'd at least get what they wanted at that point...just at their expense unfortunately. "
'BUT THERE IS NO COLLUSION!!!!!!!!!\n\nlol'
"What's the big deal? The President has already said there is NO COLLUSION!!!!!!1111\n\n/s"
'No meeting ever occurred?? What the heck do you call the meeting between high-level Trump campaign officials Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner with the Russian envoy - Natalia Veselnitskaya and the other Russians? The meeting took place to deliver the stolen emails from the DNC'
'Fucking conspiracy against the US by Trump campaign, disgusting! And that POS defiles the White House now... it is a shame!!'
'Why, if there was nothing to hide about his relationship — or attempted relationship with Russian officials — would Papadopoulos feel the need to put himself in serious legal jeopardy by lying about the timing of his conversations with ‘the Professor’?'
"What's the big deal? The President has already said there is NO COLLUSION!!!!!!1111\n\n/s"
"So what happens if Mueller decides to file charges and indict Trump? Can the president be arrested? Couldn't he just say screw that and ignore it? "

"No, he doesn't. Not only is he a disgusting, pathetic excuse for a president, but he is also a disgusting and pathetic excuse for a person. I'm embarrassed that this piece of garbage represents my country, and I'm embarrassed by inevitable comments in his favor you'll see in this very post by his supporters e-blowing that asshole."

'The time for protest is now. Remember peaceful protest means not violent it does not mean silent. We all need to raise our voices and be heard.

'One of the things Stephen Harper did right was taking a hard stance against Putin in 2014 after the Crimean annexation. Too bad American conservatives are happy to overthrow the post war transatlantic alliance and slurp up Putin’s cum.'
"So over half our country knows this is obvious, and the rest of the world (accept Russia..) agree that this is obvious. However, his die-hards still can't get a grip on the reality of this. The chances of them being right is shot down immediately by the sheer amount of people with common sense in the world. You don't even have to go deeper than that, that's how silly this is.\n\nI live in rural TN, and all of this reminds me of a realization I made long ago.. When you live around racists, and hear their arguments, all you have to do is look over them. All it takes is one time to know something isn't right.\n\nIs it a coincidence that a lot of these racists live in the rural south? A place where they never even experience other cultures and races first-hand? How perfect is it that people who are never even around black people are experts on them? \n\nI bring this up because this is in the same lane as *every* other issue we've had with this presidency. Making these important calls with absolutely no effort to look over themselves. It is, by term, ignorance.\n\nThere's no excuse for this today. None. We have the ability to get outside of our own bubbles with just one choice. People following suit by crapping on Canada, and praising Russia, is entirely based on their unwillingness to look deeper than their peripherals. \n\nAgain, it takes one look. One uncomfortable moment to understand that this is messed up. And no there is no hypocrisy here. I've lived in the middle of a red state my whole life. I've *heard* it all.\n\nThey don't want to put two and two together, and it leads to an obvious pattern. They complicate what Trump and Co are doing. It's the only way they can disregard the obviousness of the 2&2. It's the only way they can make sense of it without jumping over their lines. \n\nSometimes it's just that simple, guys. Hating on Canada for something they didn't even do in the 1800's, compared to a long list of things Russia has done to the entire world? Smarten up please. This has nothing to do with being red or blue. This is a beast we all need to get away from. If this shit was being done by a liberal, I'd say the same damn thing. \n\nYou can actually be a hero if you just stop holding yourself back."
'Now if only the G6 would kick us out until we get our shit together and stop electing corrupt reality television stars with zero political experience.'

'Trump, under no circumstances, will criticise Putin because of the kompromat.\n\nPee tape is real, bitches.'
"There has got to be a pee tape, seriously.  This isn't normal, Putin is bullying our president.  This is the diplomatic equivalent of thanking someone for punching you in the face."
'Trump is still on. Still talking.\nHe is making zero sense.\nSomething is terribly wrong with him, or a big story is coming.\nHe sounds insane AF.'
'He just spit in the face of every US diplomat across the world. The man has no shame'
"Hello, actual diplomat here...\n\nIf Trump is being even remotely serious, this is proof he's outright willfully ignorant.  There is no way someone did not explain this situation to him.  So, again, if he actually believes this, he A) wasn't even remotely listening in his briefings, and B) he has an incredibly uninformed view of how both diplomacy and the government work.\n\nThese people were PNG'd (made Persona Non Grata).  This is the worst *legal* thing you can do to a diplomat, but rather than saving money, it's actually incredibly expensive.  That's also, actually kind of the point.  It's a logistical nightmare *and* it costs the affected country a crapload of money.\n\nForemost, when a government does kick out US diplomats, they're not *fired*.  Every single one of these guys still has a job with Department of State, and every single one will be reassigned and likely out at another post within two years.  All the while, they will be working and receiving pay and benefits.\n\nAdditionally, when you're PNG'd you have to leave the country, like, *yesterday*...you have no more diplomatic protections, you have no visa, no legal permission to be there.  That means you have to take the next flight back to the states, regardless of cost.\n\nAll of your stuff has to be packed up and shipped out, last minute, which, again, raises costs by 25-50%.  On average, it costs anywhere from $100k-$250k to move a US diplomat (this is based on size of household, a limited amount of allowable weight, and where they are going to / coming from).\n\nYou have to break *every* lease of every person that is being sent home, again, this is penalty after penalty.\n\nYou have to fire / break the contracts of all the locally employed staff (LES's) who are Russians who work support jobs in the non-secure parts of the embassy.  This will likely mean paying out whole contracts and / large amounts of severance.\n\nClosed parts of the embassy will have to have all their equipment, computers, office furniture, etc, all shipped back to the US or a depot somewhere in Europe (probably), again, very expensive.\n\nEvery diplomat and their family who is sent home is guaranteed housing and meal support (per diem) for anywhere from 30-90 days, depending, while they get resettled.  Normally these costs are spread out over years.\n\nNow...finally...take all of this times 700.\n\nThis is going to cost the US at least $20 million (possibly up to $50 million) in the short term, probably and additional 50% of that in the mid term as all these PNG'd folks are re-language trained and/or reassigned.  In the long term (post-2020 or 2024), we will likely reestablish a larger diplomatic presence in Russia, which will likely carry a 10-25% premium because the US very rarely has to do this in non-warzones.\n\nAs a final clarification...in the sense that Russia is expelling US *diplomats*, that term is being applied to any US employee with diplomatic status.  Every major embassy has multiple missions, and they are not all State Department, but they *all* get diplomatic status.  The 700-ish likely includes FBI, Commerce, Treasury, FAA, DOD, USDA, and a handful of other agencies I'm not thinking about, but they play critical roles beyond diplomacy that deal with security, safety, and the economy. \n\n\n\n\n"
"R u fucking...seriously...we're doing this now America? *This* is what we're doing? \n\nA small nation with a fraction of our power and GDP attacks our democracy and forcibly banishes our diplomats and WE ARE THANKING THEM.\n\nEven the French wouldn't pull this shit. Y'all are pussies."
"I'm done, I want off this ride now. This is beyond disturbing; his insanity is clear for all to see. His treachery is even clearer."
'The fact that russia sent this big fuck you to america and trump responds with "thank you" just shows how weak he fucking is. They have deffo got some dirt on him if he is too scared to stand up for his country'
"So genius Trump didn't think to fire them himself if he was worried about payroll? Are they even fired and off the payroll or still being paid? Does he think Putin fired the US diplomats for him?! I have so many questions here."
'Wtf I hate sarcastic jokes now'
"He's a sad old man who has a deep psychological problem. He should be in a nursing home. "
'What the fuuuuuuuuuck???????? How does anyone consider this man patriotic?????? He is a traitor.  He obviously cares so much more about Putin than the  asshats who voted for him, but they will continue to gargle his balls and say thanks while they do it.  (As a side note, before this presidency I rarely cursed.  Thanks a lot you fucking selfish man child for ruining the country and my mouth)'
'Does he really think Putin fired US government employees??\n\n'
'What an inconsiderate asshole. Americans lose their jobs and he thanks Putin. At what point..\n\nA literal asshole, at that. He shits on anyone and everyone around him. Far and wide.'
"Shit like this is why I still believe he wants to be impeached. He doesn't want to be there but also can't quit. He needs to be impeached so he can start a new bullshit conspiracy try and make money off of. "
'Geezus, fuck, I hate this guy so much. Everytime I see his name in a headline, saying that I hate him in the comments has become like a nervous tic.'
'Besides the obvious problem with this situation as regards Trump and Putin, what kind of message does this send to employees of the State Department and members of the US diplomatic corps around the world? What, that they’re just a payroll expense? Just a headcount number?\n\nHow insulting and demoralizing for people who take their diplomatic jobs seriously, some in dangerous or hostile countries, that the president makes a statement like this.

'This is not surprising as the Chinese are being strategic with the way they are implementing their tariffs.\n\nWhat is surprising is that Trump loyalists fail to see the irony of MAGA merchandise being made in China. '
"> Several manufacturers across China's eastern Zhejiang Province have reported making flags for Trump's 2020 bid. But a Trump campaign official recently told Business Insider that all their merchandise is made in the US, and vendors who suggest otherwise are lying or violating protected trademark rights. \n\nperhaps American vendors are outsourcing Trump's contracts to China?"
"Trump has ruined red baseball caps for the rest of us. I'm a fire warden at my work, in emergencies, we must wear a red baseball cap that says fire-warden on it, but I'm afraid people will see it and run back into the fire. I'm going to propose a change to that neon green/yellow color used in fire services at our next meeting."
'Fuck this guy.  Fuck his supporters.  Fuck his enablers.  Fuck the speed at which the republicans have fucked us yet done nothing to stop it all.'
'No matter how many times misleading articles like this get posted, the r/politics braintrust still falls for them... every. single. time. \n\nIt does make sense that the average leftist is too dumb to understand the difference between official and bootleg merchandise though. '
"Trump gear isn't made in China but you guys wouldn't know that or believe it anyway. Fake news is your forte."
"It just cracks me up that he has his shit made there anyway and doesn't have an American company making it after all of his talk and bullshit. \n\nHe's a conman. You have to have been dropped on your head as a kid to not see it and in the recent past, I'd suggest at some point something crushed your brain if you're still denying it."
"Just another example of how stupid and gullible Trump's base is."

'For those who will inevitably say that Treason can only occur in the event of a Declaration of War, may I remind you that nearly half of the [treason convictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_convicted_of_treason#United_States) in the US occurred in conflicts that lacked a Declaration of War. Walter Allen was convicted of Treason without any conflict going on at all. Aaron Burr and William Blount were similarly charged with Treason without any ongoing conflict.'
'I saw it. It made me sick to watch the president help the leader of a hostile foreign state attack American citizens and institutions on live television. '
'I think it\'s worth noting that the Globe and Mail is a conservative Canadian newspaper. I understand that the contributor is a professor at an American school, but I cannot recall in my lifetime seeing one of our publications publishing so damning an article regarding a foreign leader, much less the POTUS.\n\nEDIT: many below disagree with my calling the Globe conservative, which is fair enough, though I believe it is center-right leaving. But the point I\'m trying to make is that this article is in a Canadian paper criticizing the POTUS, not some foreign policy or specific issue of import to Canada (e.g. "this stance on softwood lumber is ridiculous!), but rather containing an allegation of treason against him. I\'ve seen intense criticism of foreign leaders in our press before, but I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen them accused of treason. Not Putin, not Kim, not Erdogan.'
"He attacks NATO, the EU, and our allies non-stop with threats, tariffs, and falsehoods. Then he follows it up by standing next to Putin and saying that he believes him rather than the entire intelligence community of our country. It's honestly worse then I could have imagined, our standing in the world is suffering permanent damage. "
'We gotta start flipping the damn flags because this shit is straight up off the handle.'
"Reminder:\n\nTrump is one moron, and he's going to keep being a moron.\n\nThe real offense to democracy here is the GOP's complete refusal to hold him accountable.  The job of congress is to be a check on the President, and force the executive to uphold the expectations of the office.  The shame of Trump sits almost heavier on the heads of Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, and all the other GOP sycophants than it does on Trump himself.\n\nEven if Mueller came forward tomorrow with incontrovertible proof that Donald Trump is being controlled by Putin himself, nothing would happen without the GOP taking action, and at this point it's probably a 50/50 AT BEST."
'Anyone know where Pence is? If Trump is forced to resign they will need him around.'
"Conservative here. Never supported Donald, but others that I have supported in the past (Rand Paul especially) made me physically ill in their defense of Trumps disgraceful and un-american behavior. If today has shown me anything, it's that the discourse in the country is no longer Republican vs Democrat. It's Americans vs. Russians. The Cold War is very much alive and it is crucial that we remain vigilant. The fate of the country depends on it."
'Ok, for those that are confused about this we’re going to put this in kindergarten terms. \n\nThe police officer sends out a message over the PA system saying a bunch of candy bars were missing from the gym teachers office. So the teachers all talk to the students about what happened.\n\nThe principal from the Eagles high school asked the principal from the Bears high school to steal those candy bars. \n\nWhen the police officers looked at the cameras, they found the football team from the Bears had broken into the gym teachers office and stolen the candy bars.\n\nWhen they had a meeting and said “we have found evidence of the football players from the Bears stealing the candy bars, the principal from the Eagles asked the other principal if the football team had done it and the Bears principal said no. \n\nSo the principal from the Eagles sided with the Bears and called the police liars and told all the teachers they’re all liars for telling the children what happened. \n\nAlso it’s the gym teachers fault for not locking the door enough.  \n'
'The only alternative to this cruelty and chaos was to elect a person who used a personal email account for work, so you can see why it was a tough call for so many people.'
"Remind me, what's the punishment for treason again? "
"I always thought treason was something you saw in dramatic movies about international conflicts. I never dreamed that I would actually live to see it. And this isn't just some political activist or a soldier committing treason, it is the President of the United States.\n\nI always though Trump was a dangerous idiot, but this is a new unforgivable low, even for him. I hope he sees the inside of a federal prison for this. I hope he lives the rest of his short, miserable life as the most despised person of the 21st century."
"I just hope people learn their lesson from this. I live in an ultra-liberal area & everyone insisted that Trump was nothing to worry about. The minute I heard he was running, I thought he'd win the presidency. This was largely due to the fact he's a celebrity; we're not the most intelligent nation. Our K - 12 is pathetic & so many people are brainwashed about single payer health care, medical marijuana, gun control, etc. that they're easily manipulated by assholes like Trump.\n\nBut everyone around me seemed to live in this liberal bubble where no one disagrees with them. They figured he'd never win the primary & everyone would see him for the self serving jack-ass he is. \n\nThen the DNC pulled that idiotic & traitorous move by undermining Bernie & placing a weak candidate forward. And instead of rectifying the situation, those idiots started spouting about how voting for Hilary was people's duty. She was the lesser evil but people do not enjoy being manipulated. So many voters chose Trump as their middle finger to the establishment for taking away the people's choice and many more simply decided not to vote. \n\nTrump was always a threat & still is. I'm seriously concerned that despite all the b.s. he's been up to, he'll be re-elected. And again, I see people making the *same mistakes* and dismissing the threat Trump poses. **He still has a huge following guys.**\nThe DNC needs to win back the people's trust sooner rather than later. Otherwise, we will have another term with Trump as he guides our country into ruin."
'Wow.\n\nThis is why people say don’t talk about politics in conversations.\n\nThe amount of fighting here is absolutely awful. None of us are going to change anything if we keep going at each others throats like this. People have opinions. It’s incredibly hard to change those opinions, especially if they were raised to believe anyone who thinks differently is crazy.\n\nWe need to all come together and act like civilized people. This whole “Attack Trump” thing is only going to make Democrats look even worse than they already do to Republicans.\n\nOur country needs to start coming together and focus on being Bipartisan or else nothing will change for the better. Every 4 years, half of this country’s population will be happy while the other half will be upset. I think it’s time to actually focus on things that actually matter and stop focusing on things like the “Blame game” on if Russia hacked the election and who’s responsible. If Russia did it, we can’t blame Trump for it. We have to blame Russia. I think if Democrats want to win the next Election, one main belief will have to be imposing Sanctions on Russia.\n\nI guess this is my 2 Cents, you can downvote me to hell now, reddit.'
"i just hope when this guy is impeached they take away the voting rights of those who voted for him.\n\nlike if you fucked up this bad that you got fooled by trump i can't trust you on future elections."
'It disgusts me to see such an idiotic asshole with that much power..'
'Really, he is not smart enough to do treason, but he is dumb enough to do appeasement.  He sold the country out for his ego, thus showing his ignorance and apathy for our democracy.'
"I don't understand how there aren't hundreds of thousands of people marching on DC right now. The very core of your nation's identity is being completely destroyed by a foreign power with a compromised treasonous buffoon and it seems there will be no consequences."
"He's actually trying to spin the North Korean meetings as a bad thing... As if Trump should have gone there and publicly lambasted Un, as if they wouldn't be mocking him if he'd done just that. \n\nWhat possibly urges people to upvote such trite, clearly myopic garbage as this?\n\nDo you all just gleefully click that upvote button because of the headline?\n\nWhen talking about Fox news lying to it's base and putting them in a bubble, don't you think celebrating garbage like this reeks of hypocricy?"
'Republicans are spineless evil morons'
'And now what? What can we do? Hasn’t shit as bad as this happened already during Trump’s presidency? And what happened then? Will it be different now?\n\nIn America’s current state, I feel completely, utterly helpless. Every single time we call foul on anything there is 0 response. What is actually going to change because of this summit? If the past tells me anything, it’s nothing'
'Are people that support someone that commits treason just as guilty as the person committing treason? '
'Ya know what thought really scares me as a Canadian?  If by some twist of fate America and Russia form an alliance and go to war with... well, basically everyone, Canada is gonna get fucked on SO hard. '
'What happen to all that fire and fury from those campaign rally’s? Trump looked like he just took a belt beating from his daddy. Clammed up and quiet.'

'Kris Kobach is likely one of the most educated politicians in the country, with degrees from Yale, Harvard, and Oxford. Meanwhile he believes in a massive voter fraud conspiracy, has engaged in birtherism, and wants a Muslim registry regardless of whether or not they have a criminal record. It goes to show you that education does not preclude you from having questionable views.'
"Still blows my mind that this panel exists only because the president is deranged. Anyone in govt who goes along w it and doesn't speak out against it needs to lose their job. Any details about who's on the panel are kind of irrelevant. It's a fucking fraud. "
'Good lord.  Trumpbots saying "so what?".  Can you imagine if a paid columnist even from a mainstream pseudo-liberal corporatist outfit like NBC, let alone an actual progressive columnist, was on a Democratic president\'s "voter fraud panel"?  No self-awareness and complete denial of reality.\n\nTrump is a complete idiot to double down on the racism.  It makes no sense.  It kisses up to a small segment of the population who would never vote for a Democrat anyway, at the expense of alienating everyone else.  Due to his emotional make-up, he\'d rather seek the obsessive hyper-approval of a small segment of the population than make any effort to appeal to the broader population.'
'This isn\'t just Trump\'s "voter fraud panel head."\n\nIt\'s [Kris Kobach](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/people/kris-kobach/).\n\nExcluding his name from the title is a serious omission.'

'Breitbart is the perfect home for someone who lies and bullshits as much as they do.\n\n* One judge fined Kobach $1000 by a court because he "made patently misleading representations to the court" and the judge felt "that defendant’s deceptive conduct and lack of candor warrant the imposition of sanctions."\n\n* On appeal, a federal judge pointed out several things that "have called [Kobach\'s] credibility into question" and said "they do demonstrate a pattern, which gives further credence to Judge O’Hara’s conclusion that a sanctions award is necessary to deter defense counsel in this case from misleading the Court about the facts and record in the future."\n\n* He\'s being investigated by the Kansas Supreme Court disciplinary office for his history of lying to courts.\n\nThere\'s a reason Trump put a thoroughly dishonest man at the head of the voter fraud panel.\n\nhttp://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-kris-kobach-fined-for-misleading-court-1498264754-htmlstory.html\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/07/26/federal-judge-upholds-fine-against-kris-kobach-for-pattern-of-misleading-the-court-in-voter-id-cases/\n\nhttp://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/342389-kobach-under-investigation-by-kansas-supreme-court-disciplinary-office'

'You know how you watch GOT and think "When this character finally gets railed by karma, no matter how brutally, I won\'t feel bad for them"???'
"he's running for governor of Kansas and he might be worse than Brownback. I am scared"
'His work is fundamentally racist and anti-democratic in nature, so Kobach found an appropriate home. '
"Trump's idea of politics is pander to his base at all costs. Actually appointing compitant public servants means nothing. Just keep shoveling propaganda at his base, keep them ignorant and angry, that's all that matters. And it has worked, Trump supporters have been brainwashed to the point they don't care that a hostile communist foreign power successfully attacked our democratic American system. They know it happened, they are ok with it. Many will proudly threaten civil war when Trump is removed. "
'> Kobach, who is running for governor of Kansas on a strict immigration platform, wrote on the website.  \n\nIs illegal immigration into Kansas really a problem? I assume anyone there illegally is just passing through on their way to a state with a functional economy.'
'Here’s trump who was born into riches.  He spent his whole career in greed and racism, wheeling and dealing, bullying anyone, and associating with the American and Russian Mobs.  Trump’s only goal is to amass as much money and power as possible, and never once cared who he stepped on (over 3,500 lawsuits) - because it’s all just “business.”  And a serious percentage of misguided American trump supporters elected him President, because they think those qualities are what make America great.  America has failed.  Capitalism is a failed system.  Those of us opposed to trump apologize to the world, and especially we apologize to planet Earth.'
"Hey wasn't Pence a part of this fraudulent voter fraud commission? hmmm - tsk tsk"

'Yeah, no shit.\n\nAnyone who tries to tell me "he\'s a great businessman," I tell them they only believe that because of a reality TV show.\n\nPrior to the show he was a bankrupt clown with no credibility.\n\nAnyone who doesn\'t believe or realize this is probably <30 years old, poor, uneducated or any combination of those three.\n\nWhen the show started, it was a total joke. People were like "Haha oh good, this failure can give it another shot pretending to be boss." I think most people didn\'t believe he even owned "Trump Tower" just that it had his name on it. (And who knows if he really does own it?)\n\nHe then, brilliantly to be honest, leveraged that image to slime his way around the world borrowing from various dumbfucks and putting his name on everything.\n\nAnd for while it seemed like he was in on the joke. He knew he was full of shit, but he would point at the rubes and his bank account with a shrug and a wink.\n\nLegend has it that he would do "business conferences," supposedly leveraging his name with something like "Donald Trumps Business Secrets," show up and say "If you\'re sitting here, you\'re going to fail." and then off he would go. A bunch of dumbfounded idiots sitting there wondering what they spent thousands of dollars on, and traveled thousands of miles to see.\n\nAnd then he leveraged the same name and fraudulent persona to grift a bunch of desperate opium addled dumbfucks, and greedy "business" types into making him President.\n\nHe is a fraud to his core.\n\nEdit: Fixed some typos.'
'I remember watching the opening to the show where they talk about his "comeback" but it was never clear how.  The casinos failed.  All those Trump branded products failed.  Trump Soho was a disaster.   What was the big comeback project?\n\nThere wasn\'t one. '
"If you watch the Conman episode of Dirty Money on Netflix they interview the creators and they said something to the effect of wouldn't it be funny to portray a washed up relic from the 80's as a high-power tycoon. Apparently not enough people saw the irony "
'Trump is a parasitic branding exercise gone terribly, terribly wrong for the host body. In this case, sadly, the host is the United States of America. '
'There was no apprenticeship or job offered.   Fake hair.  Fake bone spurs.  Fake income.  Fake show.'
"I can't take people like this seriously if they are apparently sitting on a goldmine of 'evidence' of all these claims..from sexual harassment, video, audio, etc.. and all you get are crickets from them.  \n\nIn an era of #metoo and standing up for the right thing...they sure are pussies about it."
'81. Trump has claimed to be worth 10 billion dollars.\n2. During the campaign Trump complained that he was losing "a lot of money" by no longer being on the Apprentice\n3. A show like that is likely to pay around 15 to 25million per year.\n4. a person with 10 billion to invest might be able to get an 8 percent return.  That would be a return of 800 million per year.\n5. It makes no business sense to take a full time job that would pay less than you would make by increasing your rate of return from 8% to 8.25%.\n6. Donald Trump is not worth even a billion dollars.\n7. It is highly likely that Trump is still leveraged with more debt than assets and was living hand to mouth with his TV earnings and maybe laundered money. His lavish spending and pretend billionaire status would require a lot of money to maintain.\n8. This would explain why Trump is leveraging his travel and charges to the secret service at Mara Lago and other locations.  This would also explain why he is so willing to imply a degree of access along with a membership at Mara Lago, or spending a lot for a condo or hotel room.  He needs the money and his occupancy is going down along with his popularity.  This is despite this being a clear violation of the emoluments clause of the constitution.\n\nEdit:  I love how a post with just a few upvotes is receiving so much attention from the gullible people at r/the_mcDonald\'s.  One little message to you guys, in the year 2000 many of you voted for George W Bush and if you were old enough, all of you would have voted for him.  You might remember how the other side complained about his deregulation and his war mongering and the corruption in his administration, well we were right about every single point then and we are right now Donald Trump is doomed to fail because he has every fault that GWB had and he is  stupider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
'no shit.  Only idiots thought reality tv was real life.'
'Everyone in the NE states knew that Trump was a disgraced fraud which is why they voted like 9:1 against him.'
'But he was a billionaire real estate tycoon. What the hell is going on?'
'Where the hell were these assholes during the campaign?'
"The problem is the stupid people in middle America and the south don't know the difference between TV and Reality. It is no shock they fall for fake news either. "
'So essentially the reason why we are living through this nightmare is because Trump is amusing to watch for a few minutes when people watch TV,  And the only reason he’s amusing to watch is because he’s a liar who was propped up by terrible people who wanted to make money off  the amusing liar. And only reason why they were able to do that was because others before them enabled the liar because he was famous. And the only reason the liar was famous was because he was a liar. '
"As someone who enjoys some shows The Apprentice at the time was a cool show (hindsight is 20/20 so don't cruisify me)\n\nBut having seen it, you can plainly see this whole Presidency and even his campaign trail it's all about image. Trump cares so much about his image, hides his balding with a fucked up hairstyle nobody would ever sport... Fucks with his physical, releases the wrong numbers on it.. campaign trail, always wanted to be louder and come off stronger that Hillary... But he's still just an out of shape old man who may borderline have some mental problem. Who knows.\n\nAll I know is the guy, whenever he is done his term.. has no place to live in North America or Europe really. "
'No duh, I thought most everyone knew trump was never that super rich, super successful, mr businessman he played on TV.'
"I still think this is what Trump's hiding in his returns.  He doesn't give a shit how much illegal activity is known to the public, there's a LOT more damage to his image if his billionaire-mogul image falls apart."
'He was a douche on that show but I never imagined his real persona was far worse even. '

He's trash and we should totally revel in that, but what's the point of talking about impeachment? Wasn't Clinton only impeached because it was perjury when he was asked about it under oath?"
'nothing will come of this. unlike Bill Clinton, Trump is a Republican.  \n\nRepublicans are allowed to violate the Constitution, commit high crimes, lie with impunity, steal from the American people, engage in adultery, pedophilia and rape, and never face any consequences.'

'Those non disclosure contracts are a bitch. Another reason Trump isn’t revealing his taxes. All those etc. costs might be questioned. '
'Steve Bannon, President Donald Trump\'s former top strategist, alleged in journalist Michael Wolff\'s tell-all book about the Trump White House that the president\'s longtime attorney, Marc Kasowitz, "took care" of 100 women during the presidential campaign.\n\n"Look, Kasowitz has known [Trump] for twenty-five years. Kasowitz has gotten him out of all kinds of jams," Bannon reportedly said. "Kasowitz on the campaign — what did we have, a hundred women? Kasowitz took care of all of them." \n\nThis apparently off-hand remark may take on new significance after The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that another lawyer for the president, Michael Cohen, sent $130,000 to a porn star just weeks before the 2016 presidential election to keep her silent about an alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump.\n\nThe Journal reported that Cohen, who was the Trump Organization\'s top attorney for about a decade, arranged for the payment to Stephanie Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels, in October 2016 after a negotiation between her lawyer and Cohen on a nondisclosure agreement.\n\nClifford has said privately that the encounter happened at a July 2006 celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, the newspaper reported.\n\nTrump married his third wife, Melania Trump, in 2005.\n\nCohen said in a statement to The Journal that Trump "once again vehemently denies any such occurrence as has Ms. Daniels." Cohen also did not address any payment.\n\nBannon made the remark about the 100 women as part of a larger discussion about the president\'s top advisors, some of whom he disparaged at length in Wolff\'s controversial book, "Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House," which the president has condemned as "full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don\'t exist." \n\nNew York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg drew attention to Bannon\'s comment in a tweet on Friday afternoon, shortly after the publication of the Journal report. \n\nAt least 22 women have accused President Donald Trump of sexual misconduct — including ogling, harassment, groping, and rape — between the 1970s and 2013. \n\nAnother adult-film star, Jessica Drake, in October 2016 accused Trump of kissing her without permission at that same 2006 golf tournament that Clifford attended. The White House has called her accusation "totally false and ridiculous."'
"Man, this guy coulda had it made if he lost the election. Coulda started a news org and just bashed Hilary while they dug up and exposed info about her all day every day, twisting it anyway they could do make her and democrats look bad. Instead he's just getting shit all day every day, must be exhausting. All he wanted to do was make fat stacks off republican anger and skepticism for the rest of his days:( "
"That's sad if 100 women decided to take a paycheck instead of speaking out about what he did. There were at least 19 accusers who didn't though but it makes me wonder if the women who were paid off had something worse happen to them."
"One hundred women.\nWhat the actual fuck.\nThere are 106 women in Congress; imagine if every single woman in Congress had been assaulted byTrump.\nThough that wouldn't surprise me at this point."
'Steve Bannon will always be a piece of shit but I guess in this case “the enemy of my enemy is my friend”.'
'The Clinton Campaign still  had enough materials to try and do damage, but chose to fight civil.'
'If a mailroom boy working for Senate Democrat was accused of a sexual transgression, the Republicans would be all over him with Senate, federal, civil, etc investigations, interviews with the accuser, press conferences, blah blah blah\n\nIt says a lot when they keep their shithole mouths shut when their President is accused of the same by tens of accusers.'
'Rapist in Chief '
"I despise Steve Bannon he is a human waste receptacle, however he was the chief strategist of the Trump campaign, he knows where the bodies are buried, this is one guy you don't turn your back on, sad day for Trump."
'The payoff was not because of Trump having whores.  The payoff was to keep the women quiet about Trump\'s tiny limp pecker and what these women had to do to make insecure Donald feel like the "Big Man".  '
'So basically these women got paid to sleep with this bloated, narcissistic, racist, bully buffoon? Makes sense!'
'Part of me wants to say fuck Steve Bannon, while the other part of me loudly yells Fuck Steven Bannon.'
'TBH, trump fucked us all.'

'This is Trump’s first press conference I saw live (normally I’d watch excerpts on the news and stuff). I knew his speech and sentence structure was all over the place, but I didn’t know it was THIS bad. '
"I'm a Canadian just sitting back with my jaw on the fucking floor wondering what the hell has happened to America? If someone told me 3 years ago where we'd be in 2018, I'd have laughed\n\n"
'I expected this to be a huge embarrassment, but what unfolded today is a historic new low. Holy shit. '
'There have been many moments in the past in which have lent credence to the notion Trump is controlled by Russia, but this press conference is the absolute, definitive moment we will look back upon years from now and say “this man doesn’t belong to the United States. He belongs to the man  to his left”. \n\nTo see the President of the United States stand next to Putin, a murderous thug responsible for interfering with America’s democracy, and blame his OWN FUCKING COUNTRY for Russia’s actions is beyond disgusting. \n\nAnd it further sickens me millions of Trump supporters will fall in line with his Russia-loving rhetoric.  \n\nTrump is a danger to America. \n\nEdit: can’t tell my left from my right apparently '
"I wonder what Trump's motivation really is. Is it just money? Just new Trump Towers?\n\nI mean, if it's kompromat it has to be something pretty goddamn awful. Trump raping an underage Ivanka or something.\n\nEDIT: #TRE45ON"
'If Trump was this bad during the press conference, you have to wonder how utterly spineless he was during their one-on-one meeting.'
'Most treasonous performances. '
'Its like there was a big red flashing TREASON arrow pointing at him the whole time.\n\nIF we ever escape from this lunatic this press conference will go down  as one of the most shameful occurrence in American history.'
"Holy hell are the bots out for this. Can't have daddy Russia getting slandered "
'Could that goddamn fucking Oompa Loompa whore himself out to Putin any more blatantly?  At this point he could literally suck Putin off on camera and Republicans would praise him.'
"He is *still* bringing up Clinton's emails while refusing to denounce a Russian attack.\n\nWhat a fucking pussy president. "
'Trump though process: I can either side with the U.S. intelligence community, a group of patriotic and experienced professionals or go with my gut feeling about Putin, an ex-KGB agent, tyrant, and megalomaniac....  Well, for this ignorant fool, the choice was obvious... the lap dog is now licking the boot of his master and undermining our national security.  I cannot say I am surprised, but I am more disgusted than usual about the fact so many good citizens allowed this arrogant tripe to be in a position to represent our nation.  It is one thing for him to pander to his narrow-minded base, but now he is complicit with covering up an assault on this nation\'s institutions and gives this communist tyrant further motivation to repeat his interference in our democratic process.  Any Republicans able to look the other way or spout more hyperbolic rhetoric about "witch-hunt" are now just showing how much they are willing to sell out this nation\'s integrity in exchange for their petty need to feel like they are in charge.  The truth, as long as this moron sits in the White House, is that only chaos and confusion is running this nation, or ruining this nation.'
'Damn it Mueller.  Bring out the Indictments on the Trump crime family already.  '
'This is a repeat of Charlottesville.  Nazis kill someone and Trump blames both sides.  Russia attacks us and Trump blames both sides.'
'Trump has now reached the end of the rope. He has met with the Pope, Jong-un, Japan, China, India, Mexico, Canada, C-7, NATO, the Queen, May, and again with Putin... No results. Now there is no place left for him to to hide. Its time to turn and face the music...\n\nThe Trump Organization has been sued 2,500 times. Trump is not scared at all by rank and file Lawyers, Russian operatives, Mafia types, or Municipal and State legislators. Like a mini mighty dictator he believes he can manipulate or beat them all. He is terrified, however, of Detectives, Auditors, Intelligence Agencies, and Journalist. They can spot the deception, voodoo economics, lies, sales pitches, and the proceeds of crime. \n\nOur problem: What happens to Democracy and the Law when the electorate or a jury are a combination of, the easily manipulated, the uneducated, have a short attention spans, are apathetic or have no moral standards. \n\nIt time for a new civil and moral awakening. Its time to understand that money, the markets, and the processed of commercialization are amoral. Its time to reaffirm that an attention to and a investment in a multi nodal, principle and morals based civilization is going to be important for peaceful existence and our survival. '
'Remember when 44 went to Japan and bowed to the Prime Minister (in a culture where bowing is used for almost every form of conversational messaging except maybe anger)? And people lost their fucking shit?   \n\nCan you IMAGINE if 44 held a press conference with a hostile foreign power and was like “yeah the US IC is totally wrong because this guy swore he didn’t do anything”. \n\nI can’t figure it out. '
'Russian meddling is no problem. But Canada is the national security threat and needs tariffs. What happened to you America? '
'This treasonous piece of shit needs to rot in Guantanamo.'
'Fuck you Trump, you piece of shit. '
"**TRAITOR TRUMP** can't help himself. His incompetence and ego can't be restrained. He needs to betray our country. Along with all the GOP sycophants who complicity enable his toxic agenda."

"This [thread](https://twitter.com/DanielBShapiro/status/1016435137708544001) is a scary scenario to contemplate.\n\n>1. I don't think we are fully grappling with the possibility that we could be on the on the cusp of a completely new era, a fundamental reshaping of the international order. And I don't mean over the course of the Trump Administration. I mean by next week.\n\n>2. It sounds outlandish to even say it out loud, and some can easily call this hyperbole. I hope to God it does not happen. But we would be insane not to grapple with the possibility.\n\n>3. Trump clearly wants to pull the US out of NATO. He doesn't believe in the alliance (or any alliances); he thinks our allies take advantage of us; he complains that NATO is worse than NAFTA(whatever that means); he seeks purely transactional relations with our closest partners.\n\n>4. Should other NATO members meet their 2% of GDP defense spending targets? Absolutely. Trump is on solid ground to push for it. But to consistently trash allies, undervalue their contributions to our security, threaten to withdraw US troops -- that's him wanting out.\n\n>5. Perhaps most damaging is that his rhetoric is building up hostility to NATO among his supporters. It's a huge breach in the consensus American support for the alliance that has undergirded Western security for 70 years, and it won't disappear when Trump does.\n\n>6. What's more, his passionate desire for friendship with Putin is emboldening Russia & risks doing further damage to European security. If he recognizes Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, if he seeks to tone down sanctions on Russia over its aggression vs Ukraine, watch out.\n\n>7. This could play out in the next 2 weeks. If he sabotages the NATO summit the way he did the G-7, don't be surprised if he actually makes a move toward exiting NATO. Think he won't? On what basis? Because his staff restrains him? Because of his strategic understanding? Please.\n\n>8. If we get there, the implications are innumerable & terrifying: Russia pawing at Baltics &other E & C European states; breakdown of joint defense structures; withdrawal of US troops from Euro bases; less restrained German foreign policy; weaker US power projection to Eurasia.\n\n>9. That just scratches the surface. We honestly cannot begin to imagine living in a new era without these international organizing structures. Because for all of NATO's challenges, no sane person or American political leader has or would contemplate such a reckless move.\n\n>10. But it could happen. Our President doesn't know the history or strategy, doesn't listen to experts, personalizes everything & makes it transactional, & loves the drama of the outrageous move that dominates cable TV coverage. For him, pulling out of NATO is all gain, no cost.\n\n>11. Even as I write this, it sounds fantastical. I will be the happiest person on the planet if I look back at this thread and say, man, you were way overreacting. But we need to be ready for this awful scenario to play out.\n\n>12. I repeat: we are potentially on the verge of a wildly dangerous cascade of events that will devastate our interests, weaken our leadership, abandon our allies, embolden our adversaries, and make the world a darker and more brutal place.\n\n>13. We have done no planning for this course of action. No one thinks it is a good idea. But one man, whose knowledge and values are wanting, whose motivation is suspect, and whose supporters follow him blindly, could take us there.

'This could be the meeting that forces the EU to start a joint EU military, and take matters into their own hands. They would no longer be obligated to march lock step with the US, which is something we have been trying to prevent for 70 years.

"Europe can and should do more to look to its own defences, but this administration seems to be saying loud and clear that we can no longer count on American help if it all hits the fan.\n\nThat and America starting trade wars, and the federal government ignoring climate change, it's all so sad.\n\nIn the past America provided the leadership to tackle these problems, and threats to democracy. Flawed at times yes, but now America is stepping back, and that will only be the worse for them. Providing leadership gives a chance to steer things in your desired direction, and I think that whatever benefits Trump believes that abandoning 70+ years of prior precedent, the costs in the long run will massively outweigh the benefits."
'There is no support for attacking NATO, except for Russia. \n\nThis is evidence and maybe even proof Trump is compromised. Trump himself can’t make a cogent argument for how NATO hurts the US, without making stuff up and conflating other issues like trade deficits.\n\nThis is more than odd or strange, it’s evidence of corruption.'

'Conservatives hate the NFL for players silently protesting the police, but are silent when Trump attacks the FBI.'
'They raised holy hell when he wore a tan suit.'
'Wait, what?!\n\n\n\nObama would have been impeached day 1 if he lied about his inauguration crowd!\n\n\n\nI hate to think what would have happened if he criticized the FBI.'
'Because republicans are horrible deceitful fucking assholes. FULL FUCKING STOP. They aren\'t stupid, they aren\'t misguided, they are fully aware of what they are doing. They are legitimately "THE BAD GUYS". They are the fascists they tell everyone to fear. They are the law breakers and criminals they claim we need to be tougher on. '
"Most obvious statement ever.\n\nThey'd be all over Obama if he...\n\n - wasted 6 hours a day watching cable news\n\n - Tweeted catfights with celebrities and foreign leaders\n\n - profited his business from hosting him as president\n\n - assigned his children to crucial govt roles\n\n - voted himself a tax cut\n\n - Met with Russian agents\n\n - encouraged violence at his rallies\n\n - raised fear against migrants and minorities\n\n - Fired the FBI head for investigating him and attacked the entire service\n\n - Called someone Pocahantas\n\n - Had been accused of sexual assault by over a dozen women\n\n - and confessed to such allegations on tape\n\n - Picked a side in the palestinian conflict...\n\n - then Openly feuded with the UN about it\n\n - insulted McCain and other veterans\n\n - insulted women on a daily basis\n\n - praised nazis and the KKK\n\n - threatened to shut down news outlets\n\n - ran a revolving door cabinet with unhear of turnover...\n\n -  and feuded with his own cabinet members, exacerbating the problem\n\n - openly supported a child molester\n\n - leered at underage girls like a child molester\n\n - had been accused of raping a thirteen-year old girl\n\nBut apparently all Obama had to do wrong was be black. Who knew fucking up as president could be so uncomplicated?"
'[Daily reminder that white nationalist terrorist Timothy McVeigh committed the deadliest domestic terror attack in US history because he followed treasonous, anti-FBI conspiracy theories.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDZyyPKAgyw) Make no mistake, McVeigh would identify as "alt-right" today. '
"But that is the point. They have been running Karl Rove's playbook for almost two decades now. To push the hot button issues, create havoc, provoke outrage. All their polling data suggests is that facts are irrelevant to their conservative base, what matters is how they make their base *feel*. Year in year out it works."
"Yep. They would have. Over much less, too.\n\nI don't blame Republicans who attacked brown suits and spicy mustard. It won them majorities.\n\nI blame Democrats who, faced with undeniable corruption and hostility, cower and let it happen. They're failing to combat this nonsense with as much fervor as their opponents railed against mustard.\n\nYou can't always treat children like adults. Sometimes the only way to reach them is on their level. Democrats need a fucking spine already. If this shitshow isn't enough to summon one, I dunno why they even bother showing up."
"Soooo... let's raise holy hell about this one!  Scandal a day be damned, this president is attacking our FBI, and that is unacceptable!  He needs to resign."
'I hate this guy. He was so anti-Hillary during the election and now acting shocked that Trump is a terrible human. Only because his "former" friend (Trump) attacked *his* wife on a personal level. What a crock of shit.'
'Conservatives did raise holy hell when Obama did literally anything.'
"Yes, so *why the fuck* are the Democrats just sitting back and letting them get away with it????\n\nI'll re-post a comment of mine from a few days ago, for why this is such an unbelievably stupid strategy by the Dems that's been failing for literally decades now...:\n\n> Think about it through the lens of game-theory: You have two parties. One of them lies and cheats all the time, while the other one remains (somewhat) honest.\n\n> Now, what happens?...\n\n> 1. When the honest party has control, the dishonest party lies and cheats and obstructs absolutely everything. The honest party tries to be bipartisan, and as such, they get nothing done. They are always being obstructed and slandered.\n\n> 2. When the dishonest party has control, the other party doesn't obstruct everything.\n\n> 3. Therefore, the dishonest party gets more of their agenda passed, whereas the honest party gets virtually nothing passed. The dishonest party gets to pass all sorts of horrible, partisan crap.\n> 4. Now, when the honest party gets control again, they have a mountain of shit to climb, and before they get any of their own agenda passed, they have to repeal an insane amount of partisan shit - but, remember #1, they'll be obstructed the entire time.\n\n> 5. So... They'll spend their entire time in office just trying to get back to where they started. They won't have any time to actually work on their own agenda, they'll be too busy trying to fix the damage done by the dishonest party.\n\n> You'll notice that the above basically describes US politics for the last several decades. By lying, slandering and obstructing, the Republicans get further ahead than the Democrats. And, every year, it gets a little bit worse. The country goes further and further to the right. They've already undone (or tried to undo) virtually everything Obama fought so hard to accomplish in 8 years - in 1 year. So, imagine what they'll do over the next 3! And, Obama had majorities in both houses for the first couple years (and at least one majority for like 6)... Yet, it's all been undone in 1 year - because the Republicans cheat, whereas the Democrats think they're better than that.\n\n> The Dems need to smarten up and fight fire with fire. Their current strategy is doomed to failure. Slow and painful failure."
"Fuck, I'm liberal as hell and I would've raised holy hell if Obama attacked the FBI like this."
'Comparing how Republicans would react to their own behavior coming from Democrats happens so often, there could be a weekly game show based entirely upon recent occurrences.\n\nEDIT: *"THIS Week!  On [crowd joins in] HOW!  HYPOCRITICAL! is the REPUBLICAN! AGENDA!!*" (big applause/show theme song)'
"I truly wonder if we are past the point of return for some citizens, particularly the ones who would vote for Trump if he were to shoot someone on 5th avenue as he said. There is large constituency that republican lawmakers know they can count on to wait for someone else to do their thinking for them and they cannot be dissuaded from republican talking points and misinformation, no matter how deluded and fallacious those talking points may be. It's incredibly frustrating and increasingly dangerous for the American republic.\n"
'*Democrats* would have raised holy hell if Obama attacked FBI like Trump.'
"Joe, they have no shame, don't give two shits about hypocrisy and find your outrage amusing. The only option at this point is to kick them the fuck out of power and make their donors pay a heavy price for being garbage."
"Not that that means anything.  They raised holy hell when he didn't wear a flag pin.  (That was probably made by Republicans and only given to them.)  They raised holy hell when Obama wore a tan suit.  They raised holy hell many times over at the very thought of doing anything to correct the broken medicine system, before the first plan had been put together.  If they weren't rabble-rousing when Obama was in office, they were asleep."
'Actually, conservatives raised holy hell about everything Obama did and didn’t do. '
'Just look at how they attack anyone who (verbally) attacks police. But obviously this is different. '
"These fucking conservatives are going to wake up one day, realize their country is no longer the same and will ask us why we didn't do anything. I'm tired. "

'Trump voting republicans have now killed more Americans in terrorist attacks than foreign terrorists.'
"The Trump/Russia era seems to be about:\n\n * Deepening the division between right and left\n * Making the entire right heavily armed\n * Stopping law enforcement from monitoring far-right groups\n\nAll of the guns and violent intents are massing on one side ... That's what fomenting a revolution looks like.\n\n"
'There was a bill a while ago that proposed that people on a terror list be banned from owning a gun, the bill was shot down.\n\nThis is utterly ridiculous '
"So...his tweet blaming the neighbors was in very poor taste. In reality, it's Trump's fault as well as any other politician who pushed NRA rhetoric. Fuck these greedy pieces of shit politicians who don't fight for us common folk. "
"That rule was terrible. Can't balance your checkbook? No gun for you. No that's not an exaggeration - if you couldn't handle your own social security finances you were going to be put on the NCIS no buy list.\n\nhttp://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/02/mentally_ill_gun_sales_trump.html"
"Is such a rule constitutional? Although I'd like gun control, these sorts of rules seem to discriminate against mentally ill people as if their conditions mean they enjoy fewer rights as citizens. That seems like a bad precedent to set. Until they've actually done something wrong, you shouldn't be able to take away constitutional rights from people. This policy would just discourage people from coming forward with mental illnesses."
'Being mentally ill has no greater likelihood of being violent, actually. I’m sick of us being the scapegoat every time a white supremacist asshole shoots up a school. The aclu fought this law because it was unconstitutional. You were put on a list for receiving ANY SSI benefits. I’m all for gun control, but not laws that put people far more likely to be *victims* of violence on some illegal fucking ban list with no due process. I wish other Democrats would actually look this up before assuming. \n\nEdit: being unfit to handle your own finances can include things as innocent as severe dyslexia. Again, stop equating people who have mental problems with violence. The research has never supported it.'
'I feel like this issue of mental health is a distraction.  I understand it undermines his own message on mental health being an underlying issue for this shooting, but...the idea that mass shooting are to be blamed on America’s mental Heath system is to ignore the fact that other countries have citizens with  mental illness and those countries don’t have the homicide and mass shooting issues we do.  There is only one correlation and that is guns.  Especially our worship of guns.  To look at this guys social media accounts you’d think his actual God(s) were guns.  '
"Reading through these comments reminds me of the reasons I ended up voting republican in 2012. Jesus fucking christ I've never understood how democrats could be rational and level headed until the instant a gun got involved and then you fuckers lose your minds and forget about due process and rights. "
"If you're worried that such rules may interfere with you getting a gun, you should probably loose the MAGA hat and seek therapy."
"Abort a baby to these people, and you're a murderer who should go to prison, and laws should be made to keep it from ever happening again.\n\nShoot and kill 17 children, and it's unfortunate but we can't allow anything to interfere with the most basic and important right of all mankind- the right to have guns. \n\nYou can die of easily treatable problems in this country because the care costs 10x what you make in a year, but you can buy the gun to shoot yourself and get out of it. (bonus: life insurance doesn't pay out on suicides!) \n\nYou can have your right to participate in the democratic process permanently revoked for having a few ounces of a mildly narcotic plant in your possession.  But you'll have plenty of guns to take out your unhappiness at the government. \n\nYou can have your personal property seized by police, even when you haven't been convicted of any crime. But you can get all the guns you want to have an armed standoff with them.  \n\n"
'This is just sick misinformation you guys.'
"This is way oversimplified.  Congress acted to pass a bill that was supported by the ACLU and NIH (neither of which are particularly right wing let alone pro gun) as well as yes the NRA.  The rule that was implace was that anyone including old people and anyone with any degree of mental disability who because of those reasons cannot handle their own finances were put on the criminal background check as inelligible to purchase firearms. This rule was put in place by a government finance agency that has literally no jurisdiction in what firearm laws.  To say that people because of mental impairment who can't handle their own finances are inherently violent and dangerous is stupid and absurd. Needless to say this rule was ultra vires if not blatantly unconstitutional.  But of course why look at the facts when you can just get a dunk on Trump in front of people who don't know any better. "
'So no one here is actually familiar with the law in question? \n\nMentally ill people are still banned from gun ownership. This is a federal law,  long pre-dating this law being removed.  Its not going anywhere. \n\n\nThe part being changed here is where getting someone to help you manage disability/social security benefits and finances makes you automatically considered mentally ill and dangerous. \n\n\n[The ACLU](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ACLU.pdf) also happened to want this section gone(as well as many other rights organizations), and its pretty rare that they take any sort of pro stance on gun stuff unless its also violating the other amendments with issues on due process, etc. \n\n\n\n'
'First off, this rule wouldn\'t have stopped this shooting.\n\nThat said, Trump and Republicans are dead set against any regulation of firearms. That is why we are here.\n\nWe regulate most every other facet of regular life, but people will scream and shout "SECOND AMENDMENT!" whenever regulation is even discussed.\n\nAutomobiles used to be insanely dangerous until regulations were put in place. During WW2 planes were 10,000x more likely to go down than today. Because of rules we generally don\'t have poison in our water (sorry Flint). The list goes on. This isn\'t to say that all laws or regulations are good, but guns are the only vestige of American life that has been like teflon to any solutions.\n\nThis is not about abolishing 2A. This is not about taking your guns. It\'s about living in a reality where a blind person cannot get a commercial airline license and a guy who gets multiple DUIs is not allowed behind the wheel without a breathalyzer. '
"This is mental illness shaming.  Most murderers and shooters don't even have a recorded mental illness."
'Republicans are trying to push the "mentally ill" bullshit to make the shooter seem more human, so you won\'t question why we can get guns so easily. Mentally ill people still know right from wrong. This kid was just a loser who got bullied and decided to shoot people to get petty revenge. He\'s a disgusting failure at life. He even was a white supremacist. We shouldn\'t humanize "people" like this. '
'I think we need more gun control. However, I am very wary of any precedent that takes rights away due to mental illness.\n\nI would prefer to attack this in a different way.'
"I hate Trump as much as anyone, but this isn't really what people want to make it out to be. The rule rolled back was that ANYONE who had any type of SSI mental health assistance would be added to the list and unable to get any firearms.\n\nWhat this meant in practice is that someone who has trouble managing their finances could lose their right to possess firearms, even if they don't have any mental health deficiency that would result in an increased propensity for violence. Even the ACLU was in support of the decision."
"Too bad you don't have rules blocking the mentally ill from holding office."
'Man, leave mentally ill people the fuck out of this shit. '

'Mentally unstable person *the same age as me* shoots up his high school killing 17, then the president ends a rule that blocks mentally ill people from getting guns. What an incredible time to be alive. '
'Wtf. In Illinois, you can’t apply for a FOID card until 5 years after your last visit to a behavioral hospital, which is fair. \nI’ve been treated at a facility three times, and each time this policy was applied. These visits were before the Trump Administration, however. My last visit was in 2015. \nI don’t plan on getting a FOID card, but does this mean I can hypothetical apply for one now that this rule is blocked? Technically I have 2 years left. \n\nI think revoking this rule and allowing the mentally ill to obtain a FOID card despite recent hospital visits is very dangerous. Most of the mentally ill aren’t violent at all, but mix that with white supremacy and an inflated, false sense of self-superiority and boom. It’s better safe than sorry. '
'Don\'t gun owners say Guns don\'t kill people, people kill people?\n\nHow is this logically consistent? What possible fucking reason would there be to lift restrictions on potential risks of gun ownership?\n\n"We have a mental health problem in this country"---sure that\'s true, but how does giving them better access to firearms improve the situation.\n\nTrump and the GOP seem to have an interest in a broken, sick, poor and dangerous America.

"Isn't Trump doing anything regarding the mentally ill a conflict of interest?"
'[The ACLU wanted this rule gone, too.](https://www.aclu.org/blog/disability-rights/gun-control-laws-should-be-fair) The definition of mentally ill can be applied broadly and the rule could forward laws aimed at restrictions on autonomy and the capacity to exercise other rights. Statistically there\'s no relation between mental illness and gun violence. People with mental disabilities are *less* likely to commit firearm crimes than to be the *victims* of violence by others. Though the ACLU doesn\'t say how many perpetrators of mass shootings were correctly diagnosed as mentally ill.\n\n["Disability rights groups and civil rights organizations were also concerned that the rule lacked a solid connection to public safety and might serve to restrict the rights of people with mental disabilities in other areas."](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/2/6/14522132/gun-control-disabilities-republicans-nra-obama)\n\nThe "mentally ill" argument appears to be nothing more than a convenient scapegoat to muddy the waters and prevent gun control laws.'

'"In this moment of national mourning at least we can put aside our differences of politics and all agree that racism and hatred is not welcome here"\n\nDonald Trump: \' "Hold my beer"'
"Does it matter that Trump isn't entirely wrong? The far right and the far left both showed up to brawl. From what I have seen (on Vice), the left side started throwing punches first. One of the Nazi guys, with a history of violence and mental illness, committed a terrorist act resulting in one death and serious injuries. Antifa managed not to kill anyone, but they put in some licks too. Trump deserves a lot of shit, but pointing out that both sides were up to no good is just a fact. All this is just political posturing that will get washed away in a few news cycles. It is tragic that the lady lost her life and no one is going to learn a damn thing from it. They will be fighting again somewhere else next week. "
'> "You had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest and very legally protest," Trump said, referring to individuals protesting against the removal of a\xa0Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee statue in the town.\n\nBeyond Trump\'s insane statement of moral equivalency, this statement is the most indefensible on its face. Allowing for a moment that a "good" person showed up to protest a statue removal for non-racist reasons, the only acceptable behaviors once they saw the swastikas and KKK symbology were to go home or join the counter protest. There\'s no viable justification for continuing to be a part of a protest group clearly led by white supremacists, and claiming otherwise is just absurd.'

The Supreme Court already ruled you can\'t threaten people and you are open for a lawsuit if you defame someone with untrue rumors. Hate speech on the basis of race, culture, nationality, and sex should probably finds its way onto the list at some point.\n\nThe other thing is why was it so bad that there were batons and riots going on? We have such an aversion to violence, but if I knew there were a group of white supremacists rallying to say that I can\'t be in my country based on the fact that I\'m not a pure bred white person, I would be fucking livid.\n\nTheir rationality for their hatred is completely indefensible and Trump is desperate to push this "both sides" narrative so that he can soften the blow. This chump doesn\'t want his approval to drop any further by pissing off his most loyal group, the racists and nationalists that depend on an incompetent government to stop holding them accountable for their ridiculous ideologies.'

"There actually is one area where crime has increased: Anti-Semitism. Unfortunately for Trump, they are by far-right radicals that echo the same sentiment he is tweeting.

The number of such abuses carried out by Muslims appears to be increasing, and that plays into the hands of right-wing movements such as the Alternative for Germany, whose program focuses on anti-migrant and anti-Islam policies\n\nhttps://www.aspistrategist.org.au/anti-semitism-on-the-rise-in-germany/"
'The article and the linked article are not exactly correct.\n\nWhile the total number of crime is lower comparing 1992 ([PKS 1992](https://www.bka.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/PolizeilicheKriminalstatistik/pksJahrbuecherBis2011/pks1992.html)) and 2017 ([PKS 2017](https://www.bka.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/PolizeilicheKriminalstatistik/2017/pks2017ImkBericht.html?nn=96600)).

Take Novorossiya, the name Vladimir Putin has given to the huge wedge of southeastern Ukraine he might, or might not, consider annexing. The term is plucked from tsarist history, when it represented a different geographical space. Nobody who lives in that part of the world today ever thought of themselves as living in Novorossiya and bearing allegiance to it—at least until several months ago. \n\n- “I remember creating the idea of the ‘Putin majority’ and hey, presto, it appeared in real life,” Gleb Pavlovsky, a political technologist who worked on Putin's election campaigns but has since left the Kremlin, told me recently. “Or the idea that ‘there is no alternative to Putin.’ We invented that.

While such crime went down by 21.9 percent between 2007 and 2014, it was up again by 10.4 percent by the end of 2016. Some 83 percent of the cases were solved -- and 92.1 percent of the increase was attributable to the newcomers.\n\n>That's a number the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany, which got into parliament last year thanks to its vocal opposition to Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to let in more than a million asylum seekers, could inscribe on its banner. Other data points are also damning. Between 2014 and 2016, the share of solved violent crimes attributed to asylum seekers increased to 13.3 percent from 4.3 percent -- a disproportionately high share compared with the state's foreign population.\n\nIt's okay to admit there is a problem.

'>[Germany\'s latest police crime statistics report revealed that some 3,372 cases of politically or ideologically motivated crimes by foreigners were recorded in 2016 - a number up 66.5 percent compared to 2015. The overall number of politically driven crimes had also increased compared to the previous year, by 6.6 percent.](http://m.dw.com/en/german-crime-statistics-reveal-steep-rise-in-violent-and-political-crimes/a-38567261?xtref=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F)\n\n>The report, which was presented by de Maiziere in Berlin, also highlighted a considerable growth in murder and manslaughter and in rape and sexual assault cases. The statistics were up 14.3 percent and 12.8 percent from 2015, respectively. The numbers were, however, more dramatic among asylum seekers: crimes committed by refugees were up 52.7 percent in 2016 compared to 2015.\n\n>"There is nothing there to sugarcoat," de Maiziere said, while stressing that the majority of both foreign and German-born offenders in these categories were young men. "There is an overall rise in disrespect, violence, and hate," de Maiziere added.\n\nAnyone care to explain this?'
"Let's look at actual numbers between 2015 - 2017 to see what that Ol' Orange Grump Trump with the frumpy rump is talking about, shall we?!\n\nhttps://www.bka.de/EN/CurrentInformation/PoliceCrimeStatistics/policecrimestatistics_node.html\n\nHave a look at the info on that website, put out by the German Federal government.   Specifically, look at the crime statistics between 2015-2017.  It is an interesting mix of info.  Here are some of the facts provided:\n\n**2015 - 2016:  Total offenses over all - increased 0.7%**\n\n**Violent Crime:**\n\n* Violent Crime increased 6.7%\n* Murder increased 14.3%\n* Rape increased 12.8%\n* Serious Bodily injury increased 9.9%\n* Intentional simple bodily injury increased 8.1%\n* Offenses against the weapons act increased 14.8%\n* Damage to property increased 3.4%\n\n**Non-Violent Crime:**\n\n* falsification of legally relevant data increased 13.50%\n* alteration of data, computer sabotage increased 25%\n* data espionage increased 10.5%\n\n**Miscellaneous:**\n\n* Offenses against foreigners law increased 21.10%\n* Unauthorized entry (border crossing) under the Residence Act increased 61.40%\n\n**Overview of suspects and crime trends:**\n\n* German Suspects DECREASED 3.4%\n* Non-German suspects INCREASED 10.9%, with 52.7% of this being classified as immigrants.\n\nThe interesting thing to me about the 2015-2016 stats are that all of the major crimes are significantly up, such as violent offenses like murder, rape, weapons offenses, and bodily injury.  The thing that is skewing the total overall crime rate to make it seem like such a low increase at 0.7% is all of the MUCH less serious crimes such as theft.  Also interesting to note is the massive increase in unauthorized border entry and non-german (immigrant) suspects.\n\nNow lets look at 2017!\n\n**2016 - 2017:**\n\n**Violent Crimes:** Violent crime overall DECREASED 2.4%.  However, total incidents in 2017 total 188,946.  Total incidents in 2015 total 181,386.  So, violent crime is NOT the lowest it has been since 1992.\n\n* Murder/manslaughter DECREASED 1.6%, HOWEVER, total recorded cases were 2,379.  This is still 263 cases MORE than 2015 at 2,116.  So murder is not the lowest it has been since 1992.\n* Rape/Sexual assaults INCREASED 29.80%!!! This is a pretty big jump!\n* Serious bodily injury DECREASED 2.1%, BUT, still higher than 2015.\n* Intentional simple bodily injury DECREASED 2.8%, still higher than 2015\n* Offenses against the weapons act INCREASED 10.3%\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n* Economic crime INCREASED 28.7%\n* Drug offenses INCREASED 9.2%\n* Computer fraud increased 2.8%\n* Credit fraud increased 24.9%\n* Falsification of legally relevant data increased 2.4%\n\nHere is where it is gets REALLY interesting:\n\n* Offenses against foreigners law DECREASED 63.1%\n* Unauthorized entry (border crossing) under the residence act DECREASED by a MASSIVE 79.9%!\n* Immigrant suspects decreased by 4.1%\n* Robberies DECREASED 9.7%\n\nAgain, really interesting to note is that all of the less serious crimes are significantly down, which seems to be impacting the overall change from year to year.  Total crime may be down 9.6% in 2017, but I think it is pretty irrelevant/intellectually dishonest to look at statistics in this way.  Each category should be looked at and assessed individually.  Murder, rape, injury/assault, weapons crimes, are unarguably the most serious offenses.\n\nAlso, the massive fluctuation in offenses against foreigners, unauthorized border entry, and a decrease in immigrant/non-german suspects raises a question: could the overall decrease in total offenses be correlated with these?\n\nNote: the info above is not opinion.  It is pure fact.  Vox is propagating pure bullshit to you.  Trump's tweet isn't necessarily false.  If you look at the trend between 2015 - 2017, he is absolutely correct in quite a few areas, the ones that matter, like rape, murder, assault, etc.  If you're going to look at the overall trend and include petty crimes like theft, then yea, crime is down.  But reading stats like that has no meaningful significance. "

'This is extremly dangerous. Tillerson seems to be one of the more rational members of trumps cabinett. The german foreign minister said something like "I know Trump ist chaotic, but at least we can rely on Tillerson". What\'s gonna happen now if he has fallen into disrepute?'
"Even Trumps administration believes he's a moron. Pathetic"
"Tillerson is no fool. He ran the largest company on the planet for decades and made his way through the ranks of a very insular company. As much as Exxon is a known polluter, as much as it engages in legal jujitsu to avoid culpability in climate change, as much as it fucked Alaska out of recompense for the Exxon Valdez spill, it's not all black and white. The company has imposed an insane amount of order and economies of scale to a wild, chaotic industry. It's used soft power and legal wrangling to broker contracts in some truly fringe areas of the globe and bring some semblance of law there. (It has also more or less brought the war and violence of [the resource curse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse) with it, but that's for another post.) \n\nThe story of the company is fascinating and varied, and though I would be beyond happy to see the relic of the industrial age die a quick death, [Coll's Private Empire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13372977-private-empire) and [Yergin's The Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prize:_The_Epic_Quest_for_Oil,_Money,_and_Power) paint a truly incredible story of Exxon and other oil companies and how they came to dominate the world they way they do today. \n\nIt's good to know what kind of world Tillerson comes from to understand he does, in some ways, have the bona fides to be a potentially good Sec. of State. That he works for, and has thrown in his lot with, a dangerous and malignant pervert means he deserves exactly what's coming to him."
"Here's an idea: when the president resigns he sends the letter to the secretary of state. Tllerson should write Trump's resignation letter saying it was his and get him to sign. Being a moron that doesn't read he would probably fall for it. "
'Insult to morons everywhere.'
'If SecState resigns, I would expect *this* president to either take over the role of Secretary of State or fold the entire State department into the military. \n\nTrump has always hated that diplomacy comes before weapons in dealing with other countries, even allies. All he understands is *my gun is bigger than your gun.*'
'And just now Tillerson said that was BS and he is not one to deal with such "petty nonsense".\n\nWe\'ll leave the petty nonsense to reddit and the media.'
'Lets play a drinking game.\n\nSet comments to Contriversal and take a shot everytime somone says "Fake News"\n\nCongratulations now your suffering from liver failure and alcohol poisoning.'
'Its pretty bad when a climate terrorist is the most reputable person in the entire administration'
'Tillerson just spoke, denied wanting to quit but did not deny calling Trump a moron. \n\nHe said he doesn\'t get involved in "petty nonsense". It\'s too bad for him, and his job, that his boss is the personification of petty nonsense. '
'Can we just take a moment to remember that Tillerson rarely talks to the reporters. \n\nBut in this fraught moment amidst elevated tensions with North Korea and humanitarian disasters in the Caribbean, he called a conference so that he could address the press about ... the most inconsequential headline of the morning.'
'I just watched [this press conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLHoE1-i3tw) in which Tillerson was directly asked about both of these claims.\n\nWhen asked whether the claim that he was going to resign was the only inaccurate thing in the article, Tillerson said that he wants to "dispel this notion that I have ever considered leaving", a direct denial. When asked about calling Trump a moron, Tillerson said "I\'m just — I\'m not going to deal with petty stuff like that ... I\'m just not going to be part of that effort to divide this administration". Lol.\n\nSo to recap, he explicitly denied the claim that he had considered resigning but refused to answer questions about the claim that he called Trump a moron. In other words, he *definitely* called Trump a moron—probably in earshot of several high profile staffers—and he feels confident about getting away with denying the resignation claim (we can\'t read his thoughts) but not about getting away with denying the moron claim (someone might call him out or leak and get him fired by Trump).'
"This is a man who is too stupid to realize just how stupid he is. It's like he's an animal and not a human (go away, pedants). The brains of a cat or dog, and that's being mean to cats and dogs, actually."
"LOL. Lets see. Tillerson thinks Trump is a moron. Half of Trumps cabinet at this point has seemingly resigned. Scandal after scandal emerges. Distraction after distraction.  So maybe Trump is just a terrible....\n\nNah. He must be playing 40D Chess. That's the most logical reason.  "
'Not that Kim Jon Un is the best guy or anything but if youre the leader of a country jeering at another leader as "little rocket man" just screams playground bully to me. \n\nAnd then "little rocket man" shoots up the playground'

"Brief and incomplete list of Arpaio's crimes:\n\n- Contempt of court\n- Abuse of power and corruption\n- Ignoring sex crimes (including child molestation) and failing to follow through on these cases (especially when the victims were Latino)\n- Cruel and unusual conditions in his jails, which he proudly considered concentration camps for criminals who deserved it -- even though most inmates were awaiting trial\n- Illegally profiling hispanics and harsh enforcement of immigration laws\n- Entrapping and framing a man for attempting to assassinate him as a publicity stunt for his re-election, let him rot in jail for years before the truth came out and the county settled for millions\n\nSuffice it to say, one of the most evil, sadistic, hateful, cruel, bigoted, corrupt human beings on the face of the planet. And Trump just pardoned him. Probably because he's one of the few people more evil, sadistic, hateful, cruel, bigoted, and corrupt than himself."

"All while Texas is being barraged and the media wasn't focused on him. What a vile, shitty man..."
"Trump just used the distress of the people of Texas, who right now are dealing with a Cat 4 Hurricane, to quietly pull off this bullshit. There's people out there in shelters while the president is doing his shady shit instead of being available in case resources are needed. Hurricane Harvey was just upgraded to Cat 4 and THIS is what he's been doing?\n\nRemember this, Texans.\n\nEdit: There's also that memo banning transgenders in the military. Surely he could've waited for tomorrow or a few days to do all this. I'm just trying to imagine what I would think if Obama had done this while Hurricane Sandy hit us (and then left us without power for days). 12 years later and the whole country still talk about Katrina and how the Bush handled it."
'Everyone needs to read this thread from the Phoenix News Times listing the atrocities Arpaio committed during his time as Sheriff. I knew the man was lower than scum, but I had no idea how absolutely evil he is. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/phoenixnewtimes/status/901263384087334914\n\nI feel sick.'
'Joe Arpaio engaged in illegal racial profiling. A court ordered him to stop. Instead, he left unconstitutional practices in place and defied a federal judge for 17 months and many were arrested illegally. He used his deputies to surveil and harass elected officials. He was a birther who attempted to diminish the status and damage the credibility of the previous President by suggesting repeatedly he (the first elected black President) was not born in the United States. Today, during a Friday news dump and a Category 4 Hurricane, he was pardoned even before being sentenced.There was no involvement with the Justice Department and usual procedures, protocols and vetting did not occur. A symbolic move with serious implications. This will not blow over with the storm because it is the storm. Race relations are being strained today in ways not seen for decades. These are days when good people have to stand up to lawlessness, racism and bigotry. If you are upset, you should be. It means your conscience is still working.'
'The "law and order" president just pardoned a political ally who was convicted of criminal contempt for violating a court order prohibiting him from engaging in racist practices as Sheriff.  Is there any doubt left that trump is a racist tyrant?'
"The man was literally told by the court to stop racial profiling Latino communities and got it in his head he was above the law. He's the definition of racist old man who believe the rules don't apply to him and trump goes ahead and pardons him or at least is attempting to pardon him. Crap like this is nothing more than an obvious blow horn to radical right wing nationalist that the president is with them and has there back, if Obama even once thought of pardoning an antifa member guilty of assaulting people the right would absolutely lose what's left of their collective minds. Incredibly disappointed."
'I cannot describe my anger and disgust. "Law and order" only applies to blacks and illegals in this country, apparently -- if you\'re a white supremacist or a corrupt law enforcement official, break the law and abuse your authority with the comfort that your president will circumvent the judiciary for you.\n\nLatinos, turn out and vote in Arizona.\n\nAmerica, make the GOP pay for allowing this fucking chaos to take hold.\n\nMueller, take my fucking energy.'
'This is a man who:\n\n-Was found to have violated the constitutional rights of detainees in his prisons(by a George W. Bush-appointed judge, no less) by feeding them spoiled food and denying them proper medical care - and these included detainees who had not yet been convicted of a crime.\n\n-Understaffed his departments special victims unit, leaving hundreds of sex crimes uninvestigated, because of his prioritzation of immigration enforcement over protecting his community from its most serious criminals.\n\n-Misappropriated public funds explicitly designated for other purposes in his quest to clamp down on illegal immigration\n\n-Has racially profiled Latinos, detaining them without probable cause on "suspicion" of their immigration status.\n\n-Stoked racial/xenophobic tensions by playing an active role in the "Birther" movement\n\n-Abused the power of his office by using the Maricopa County Sheriff\'s office "cold case posse" to further the bogus claims of the Birther movement.\n\n...when Donald Trump calls on us to unite as a country, then goes and pardons one of the most corrupt, bigoted, divisive public officials in in recent memory, the juxtaposition is both saddening and deeply disturbing.'
'Fucking coward.  Waiting until the nation is on pins and needles with the largest storm in 10 years to announce this bullshit.  Fuck you Trump.  '
"I'm going to be honest... This is fucking shitty. \n\nWe knew it would happen, but the audacity of pressing onward with it just to cause controversy.\n\nHe doesn't give a rats ass about Arpaio, he really doesn't, he's using the situation to see how far Congress will bend over backwards and kiss his ass at the same time.\n\n\nNo, he did this to piss off people, and to begin his list of pardons for everyone that clearly knows they're completely fucked...and god damn I hope Mueller is anticipating this, and maneuvers through this tyranny.\n\n\nPhoenix is not going to be quiet this weekend, we finally kicked this racist asshole out, finally saw the motherfucker get convicted, just to walk. We watched him waste millions, and millions, and fucking millions of dollars defending his racist actions, to be proven guilty, and to be fucking pardoned.\n\n\nTrump, you really fucked up this time."
"LMAO there's a goddamn Cat4 hurricane here in Texas, and not a word from President Mangosalt, but he pardons a goddamn racist fuck while everyone's occupied with storm coverage. I'd expect nothing less. "
'I used to work for Arpaio. In 1997 He had lowered the minimum age of Detention Officers from 21 to 18. His Deputy, Dep. Hendershott, recruited several of us 18 yr olds from jr. law enforcement cadet programs in the Phoenix area. While working as a detention officer I was amazed at how the living conditions were. Overcrowding was an issue with dozens of inmates sleeping on bunk beds in gen-pop areas, in a facility designated Medium-Max Security. That\'s not even the bad part. Immigration holds were treated like trash. They were held in holding tanks that were 25-50inmates, a single toilet and held without phone call rights. They were rounded up in his immigration raids. If you were latino, working in a latino focused business, hotels, restaurants his deputies would raid them. If you didn\'t have "proof of citizenship" you were "detained" until your legal status could be determined. This wasn\'t a quick process and took days, keeping these people from parental duties, work, medical treatment etc... This guy is a top of the line asshole.\n\n I was ultimately released from employment without being given a reason. (It\'s a right to work state). I had no administrative action or derogatory information in my records. I went into the Air Force and became a military cop and deployed man times, earned decorations, and saw limited combat, so I know it wasn\'t my ability to do the job. Who knows, but a short while after I was terminated there were riots after a Detention Officers pepper sprayed and locked an inmate in a port-a-john in his infamous tent city, where desert heat often reached 115+ in the shade. He had some high profile inmate deaths that his office was found responsible for and fined millions. \n\nWhen I talk about his policies. I put it this way to my white friends. "show me your proof of citizenship right now." Whatever they provided ie; drivers license, social security card or work ID, I found to be possibly counterfeit and warranted detainment until I could find out for sure. That is what Latinos faced on a daily basis in Maricopa County at the hands of his deputies per his direction.  Parents were scared to pick up their kids from school because his deputies would round Latinos up there. They were scared to take their children to shop for school items because of the fear of being arrested even if they were legal residents. Deputies would just say their documents were forged and they\'d be arrested. No phone calls to attain documents. When phone calls were made family and friends were too scared to go to the offices out of fear of being arrested.\n\nThe fact Trump pardoned this guy shows he is a racist prick and is setting a bad example. Make no mistake this is a sad day and I wouldn\'t be surprised if his adviser Miller didn\'t have a role in this. This guy needs to be impeached!'
"Quick remainder that Arpaio's proudest achievement, Tent City, was one of the worst run prisons in all of America. For starters, 98% of the inmates in Tent City were serving time for non-violent crimes or violation of their probation. Arpaio forced them to stay in tents in the middle of the desert. [The temperature in these tents was once recorded at 145 degrees by *Arpaio himself*.](http://archive.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/20110703tent-city-temperatures-rise-145.html)\n\nThe prison was also a terrible layout, endangering the guards who ran it. And drug abuse was rampant. I read an AMA a while ago of a guy who served time in Tent City. He said it was very common for a prisoner to go into Tent City clean and come out an addict.\n\nIn conclusion, it is disgusting that Trump has pardoned Arpaio, and even worse that many of Trump's supporters are happy with this."
'This is a good reminder: Joe Arpaio staged an assassination plot against himself to better his election chances, resulting in James Saville spending four years in jail awaiting trial. \n\n>In 1999, undercover MCSO deputies arrested James Saville, then 18 years old, and charged him with plotting to kill Arpaio with a pipe bomb. A local television station had been tipped off to the arrest by the MCSO, and broadcast footage of the arrest that evening. The MCSO held a news conference shortly after the arrest, and Arpaio appeared in interviews on local television stations, saying "If they think they are going to scare me away with bombs and everything else, it\'s not going to bother me."\n\n> After spending four years in jail awaiting trial, Saville was about to sign a plea deal that would have sent him to prison for 20 years. Although he maintained his innocence, he was initially unwilling to take a chance on being given an even longer sentence if convicted. However, the former head of undercover investigations for the MCSO called Saville\'s legal team with a bombshell -- based on his review of the case, he felt that Saville had been entrapped. Although entrapment is all but impossible to prove in most jurisdictions, Saville\'s attorneys eventually discovered that MCSO detectives had bought the bomb parts themselves, then convinced Saville to build it even though he was not predisposed to commit such a crime. On July 9, 2003, a Maricopa County Superior Court jury acquitted Saville, finding that the bomb plot was an elaborate publicity stunt to boost Arpaio\'s reelection bid.\n\n> In 2004, Saville sued Arpaio and Maricopa County for wrongful arrest and entrapment, seeking $10 million in damages. In 2008, the suit was settled, with Maricopa County paying Saville $1.6 million.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Arpaio#Staged_assassination_plot'
"This is so, so disheartening. The man was ordered by a federal judge to stop mandating that police officers detain people for appearing hispanic, without suspicion of any actual crime, in order to determine whether they are an illegal immigrant. This is textbook racial profiling. Arpaio ignored the order outright and continued his department's racist policies. \n\nPhoenix is a major city with an ENORMOUS hispanic population. Almost everywhere you go you will hear people speaking Spanish and see signs and advertisements written in the Spanish language. Many lawful immigrants and American citizens DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH. Under Arpaio's policies, basically half the population could have been unlawfully detained at any given time. \n\nThis pardon is a slap in the face to decades of cultural/racial progress. It signals that Trump, the president of the United States, 100% approves of racist practices by law enforcement, and that those that carry out these practices should have no fear of legal retribution. "
"This isn't really about the law. Sometimes, pardons are justified. Sometimes, the law goes overboard. I'm not against pardons in general when needed.\n\nWhat this is about is who Arpaio is and what he represents. Namely racism, oppressive law enforcement, and injustice. His entire career is what is being pardoned here as well as white supremacy as a whole.\n\nIt's a message. A horrifying signal to racists everywhere."
'As an Arizonan I feel like the federal government has failed me. This piece of shit is convicted and guilty of racist crimes against the county I live in.\n\nFuck you, Donald Trump.'
"Joe Arpaio basically ran a [concentration camp] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Arpaio#Unconstitutional_jail_conditions) - literally something he himself compared to a concentration camp for the people of color he arrested. He admitted to saying that he wouldn't run them differently if he had a billion dollars. \n\nHe refused to adequately investigate or try to address / put a stop to [more than 400 cases of child abuse and molestation] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Arpaio#Failure_to_investigate_sex_crimes) many in immigrant communities. He removed detectives from working sex crimes cases to do things like investigate credit card fraud on the Arizona Diamondbacks and mortgage fraud.\n\nHe has numerous cases of abuses of power and mismanagement of funds.\n\nJoe Arpaio is a terrible human being, and a bad officer of the law. \n\nMany have pointed out that Obama pardonned people - and while I disagree with many of those pardons, after researching a couple I can at least determine a moral thought process behind them.\n\nJoe Arpaio's sentence was relatively light in comparison to the crimes he committed, and his mitigating circumstances appear to be loyalty to the President and racial animosity. This is despicable."
'Fuck this shitty President. Fuck him right in his fat orange face. '
"Arpaio has a laundry list of convictions and cases awaiting trial including,\n\nFraming an assassination attempt against himself while running for reelection, the county had to pay the victim of this entrapment 1.6 million dollars.\n\nArresting two journalists who were preparing to publish an article that was negative of Arpaio in their local news paper. The journalists were paid 3.75 million dollars by Apario's county to settle the case.\n\nIgnoring sex crime cases, with 75% not being investigated or no arrests made. Arpaio blamed it on the special victim unit only having 3 members, so the state gave his department 600,000 dollars to expand the unit, the 600,000 dollars promptly disappeared and the SVU wasn't expanded.\n\nMisuse of public funds, which found that he misspent 100,000,000 from 2006-2011, including vacations to Alaska, trips to Disneyland, and a half million dollar bus for his election campaign.\n\nHe was convicted of contempt of court for refusing to abide by a federal court ruling that he must stop his departments practice of racial profiling.\n\nHe's a literal piece of shit that the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES PARDONED."
'We all knew this was coming, but still - what the everloving fuck? Why? Why is he dead-set on making the absolute worst decision *in every single case?*\n\nI have no words for this. Except fuck Trump, fuck Arpaio, and fuck the Republican Party that has allowed this shit-show to continue for as long as it has.'
'If anyone hasn\'t, I\'d **highly** recommend reading [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-08-23/arpaio-pardon-would-show-contempt-for-constitution) article from Bloomberg, which might be a little long but is a phenomenal explanation of just why this is so out of the ordinary and frightening:\n\n>To see why pardoning Arpaio ~~would be~~ [is] so exceptional -- and so bad -- you have to start with the sheriff’s crime. Arpaio wasn’t convicted by a jury after a trial for violating some specific federal statute. Rather, he was convicted by a federal judge on the rather unusual charge of criminal contempt of court.\n\n>...This is the crime that Trump ~~is suggesting he might~~ pardon[ed]: willful defiance of a federal judge’s lawful order to enforce the Constitution.\n\n\nIt\'s one thing to pardon someone who you think has paid their debt to society, has been exonerated by evidence, or who has learned the error of their ways; Trump is pardoning Arpaio, who was busted for contempt of court and basically saying "Fuck you," to the judiciary branch by continuing unethical behavior long after being told to stop. The police are supposed to be officers of the court; how well is that going to hold up when their loyalty is split and the rule of law is not allowed to efficiently run its course? When the executive and judicial branch are at loggerheads? \n\n\n>[James Madison noted at the Virginia ratifying convention that abuse of the pardon power could be grounds for impeachment. He was correct then -- and it’s still true now.](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-08-23/arpaio-pardon-would-show-contempt-for-constitution)\n\nAdd into this Trump\'s obvious contempt for Congress and it seems pretty obvious he\'s got no fucking clue how our branches of government work. If he does have any clue how they work but still is showing this contempt for our system of government, then he\'s just a two-bit wannabe dictator. '
"If you are a Trump supporter who was concerned with executive power creep under Obama but don't mind Trump literally shitting on the constitution by attempting to pardon a contempt of court charge of another branch of government, you are a hypocrite. "
'For those who don\'t know about Arpaio:\n\n>Arpaio has been accused of various types of misconduct, including **abuse of power; misuse of funds; failure to investigate sex crimes; improper clearance of cases; unlawful enforcement of immigration laws; and election law violations.** A Federal court monitor was appointed to oversee his office\'s operations because of **complaints of racial profiling**. The U.S. Department of Justice concluded that **Arpaio oversaw the worst pattern of racial profiling in U.S. history**, and subsequently filed suit against him for **unlawful discriminatory police conduct**.\n\n>Over the course of his career Arpaio has been the subject of several federal civil rights lawsuits. In one case he was a defendant in a decade-long suit in which **a federal court issued an injunction barring him from conducting further "immigration round-ups"**. A federal court subsequently found that after the order was issued, **Arpaio\'s office continued to detain "persons for further investigation without reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is being committed."**In July 2017 **he was convicted of misdemeanor contempt of court**, a crime for which he was pardoned by President Donald Trump on August 25, 2017. In a separate racial-profiling case which concluded in 2013, **Arpaio and his subordinates were found to have unfairly targeted Hispanics in conducting traffic stops.**\n\nDonald Trump has pardoned a racist corrupted sheriff. Donald Trump is a clear and obvious racist. '
"That's not even what I'm outraged about. The fact that he was only facing 6 months in prison for what he did is what's truly outrageous here."
"And of course the famous sex crime cases he didn't investigate, some involving children: \n\n>The Phoenix-area lawman has been publicly flogged since a recent Associated Press story described how his department allegedly botched more than 400 sex-crime cases, including those involving child molestations with victims as young as 2. In many cases, after taking the initial report, sheriff’s deputies failed to do much else -- even when an alleged victim knew the suspected attacker.\n\nGreat guy, the pizzagate people should speak up, this is right down their ally, except it's real. "
"Alright, can I go ahead and say that Trump is racist now? Arpaio violated people's civil rights because of the color of their skin, and Trump is basically rubber stamping that.\n\nTrump truly does not care about what is right and what is wrong."
'Normally I love our President and fully support him 100%\n\n-BUT-\n\nThis is an indefensible action.  Sherif Joe is a scumbag who has wasted taxpayer money on criminally racist policies that have not made his locality safer.\n\nThis is an outrage.  Justice is a sham on American Soil today my brothers.'
'Sheriff Joe Arpaio is a racist piece of shit and a criminal. He\'s misused funds, violated election laws, staged an assassination plot, abused his power on multiple occasions, jailed people unconstitutionally, improperly "cleared" cases to make his county appear safer, consistently racially profiled against Hispanics, ignored investigations of sexual crimes and ignored a rape of a 13 year old, and "investigated" Obama\'s birth certificate. Pardoning him shows that Trump is more than willing to defend corrupt cops who abuse their power and racists. He should be in jail.'
"There is *nothing* --no matter how reprehensible, irresponsible, hypocritical, reckless, bigoted, asinine, demagogic, misogynistic, homophobic, irrational, discriminatory, unethical, illegal, treasonous or otherwise unprecedented in the 228-year-history of the Presidency of the United States presidency-- that Donald Trump could do or say to lose the support of his most slavishly sycophantic admirers. There's no point even trying to reason with **Trumppets**--as in *Trump's pets* --because like their authoritarian-aping idol, they don't let reason, facts, logic, decorum or basic human decency get in the way of satisfying their narcissistic urge to metaphorically shit on anyone or anything that fits their narcissistic, misanthropic fancy. "
'GORKA JUST RESIGNED.Korea is launching missiles. WTF is going on.'
"Arpaio's conviction comes from the fact that he was illegally detaining American citizens, racial profiling, and enforcing immigration laws that are Constitutionally reserved for ICE.\n\nHe made it systemic policy within the Sheriff's Office to violate the Constitution and the rights of American citizens.\n\nTrump is deliberately sending the message that law enforcement can violate the Constitution without reprisals. There need to be mass protests against this."
'So he pardons a racist crook who broke the law, but he is going to repeal DACA for kids and young adults who had no choice in coming here illegally, made a life for themselves, contributed to society, because THAT was unconstitutional and an overreach of the former president?\n\nMan are we fucked.'
"Never forget: Joe Arpaio arrested journalists on false pretenses, as retribution for investigating Arpaio's corruption. The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors eventually settled for $3.75 million.\n\n> Earlier today, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors ratified a $3.75 million settlement of our lawsuit filed in 2008 against Sheriff Arpaio and special Maricopa County prosecutor Dennis Wilenchik. This follows a June 9, 2011, finding in our favor by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals with respect to efforts by Arpaio and Wilenchik to escape liability for their actions.\n\n> Unlike most of Arpaio's victims, we had the financial wherewithal to defend ourselves in court, and we were able to speak through the newspaper. But the vulnerable and impoverished victims of Arpaio's ongoing abusive practices have neither the money nor the voice to fight back. We intend to use proceeds from today's settlement to help those who fight the good fight against government actors who attack the most vulnerable among us. We further intend to help an organization that seeks to preserve and protect free speech on the Internet.\n\n> In a scathing opinion, the appeals court scolded Arpaio and Wilenchik for retaliating against a free press, for grand jury abuse, for false arrest, and for a variety of other conduct. The Court served notice that thuggish behavior by police and prosecutors against journalists strikes at the heart of the Constitution. The Court's landmark opinion has already been cited in a dozen published federal appellate cases and over a dozen federal district court opinions in the short time since it was handed down.\n\nhttp://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/joe-arpaio-loses-new-times-co-founders-win-375-million-settlement-for-2007-false-arrests-6651491"
"Our president has pardoned a man who has been convicted of and admittedly ***violating the constitution, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and court injunctions against him.*** \n\nThis man is a vile piece of racist trash who deserves to have a conviction hanging over his head, and deserves to be in the shitty desert tent jail he insists is so great. \n\nSherrif Joe ignored rampant sexual assaults, rapes, and didn't give prisoners basic human decency (made women sleep/be in their menstrual blood, among other things) and other *real crimes* in favor of criminalizing being Latino, and his county was the *only one* in Arizona with an **increasing crime rate.** It's not a surprise his shitty tactics like tent city, and racial profiling make him a favorite of the Don, though.

"One thing that this reminds me of is ex-CIA director John Brennan remarking that the most dangerous moment will come when Trump feels cornered. He worried about what Trump could be capable of when he realizes there's nothing more he can do. With each of these articles, we're inching closer to such a critical situation."
'> In early December, President Trump, furious over news reports about a new round of subpoenas from the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, told advisers in no uncertain terms that Mr. Mueller’s investigation had to be shut down.\n\n> The president’s anger was fueled by reports that the subpoenas were for obtaining information about his business dealings with Deutsche Bank, according to interviews with eight White House officials, people close to the president and others familiar with the episode.

'If the AG or deputy AG were fired and their replacement fired Mueller, how is that person not also obstructing justice?  The conflicts of interest the president tried to bring up about mueller previously were laughable. There is no reason to fire him other than to stop the investigation. Is it possible that Trump won’t find anyone that will do it because anyone that does knows they will be opening themselves up to an obstructing justice charge?'
"If he was going to fire him, he'd have done it. He didn't really hesitate to fire Comey at just about the worst timing possible. The reason why he felt he could was because he felt he could go based on others' recommendations (to try and lay it off as not really HIS decision), and there's no way anyone would seriously recommend him to fire Mueller. I think he's found his limit on optics and realizes firing Mueller will do the opposite of making this go away.\n\nIt won't stop him from bitching about what's going on, and essentially try to discredit it all as a witchhunt, which in the end won't really help himself in any way, but it should be obvious by now even to him that firing him would hurt himself much more than helping himself."

He's shown that he's really good at it, and he's excellent at making it seem like he has incredible access to people. As the article points out, some stuff already isn't lining up, like Wolff claiming Trump had never heard of Boehner when in fact Trump has tweeted about Boehner many times over the years. Also, so far, two of the people quoted in the book are denying the words attributed to them.  \n\n[The NY Mag article](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/01/michael-wolff-fire-and-fury-book-donald-trump.html) made up of Fire & Fury excerpts explains in a box at the bottom what a journalistic clusterfuck it was to gather this info, since the usual norms weren't being followed. (For example, being told something is off the record only to have the subject turn around share the same thing publicly later.) This may not seem important, but it is, because these norms are part of how journalism has credibility: gathering info surreptitiously carries all kinds of problems which is why it's so rarely done.\n\nIf it turns out that Wolff played fast and loose with the facts, even if his tale accurately captures the general spirit of the west wing, it will be a huge blow to journalism's credibility if the falseness becomes widely known -- at a time when the institution's reputation is already in tatters. If that happens, Wolff will be a villain in my eyes on par with Trump himself -- and the news organizations will bear a lot of blame themselves for breathlessly reporting unvetted claims from an upcoming book written by a notorious gossip columnist. Admittedly, they're in a tough spot since it would be preposterous for them to *not* report on the fallout that's happened since, like Trump threatening to sue Bannon and the book publisher. And reporting that story demands the context of what's in the book.\n\nBut still, the damage already done to the news media's reputation will plague US democracy long after Trump is back to hawking steaks, and making that problem even worse is a terrible thing indeed.\n\n"

'In the video:\n\nHe said, “The DNC should be ashamed of themselves for allowing themselves to get hacked.” No words of criticism on the actual Russian hackers. If that’s not traitorous speak, I really don’t know what is.\n\nEdit: Many of you are asking if the RNC was hacked, as well. Yes, it was. In this video, Trump said the RNC was fortified enough to defend from hacks, hence why they didn’t get hacked (Ahem, but they did get hacked, yes. I’m assuming that’s why all of the Republicans are scared, as their Kompromat could get revealed.)'
'>In an interview with "CBS Evening News" anchor Jeff Glor in Scotland on Saturday, President Trump named the European Union -- comprising some of America\'s oldest allies -- when asked to identify his "biggest foe globally right now."\n\n>"Well, I think we have a lot of foes. I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade. Now, you wouldn\'t think of the European Union, but they\'re a foe. Russia is foe in certain respects. China is a foe economically, certainly they are a foe. But that doesn\'t mean they are bad. It doesn\'t mean anything. It means that they are competitive," Mr. Trump said at his golf club in Turnberry, Scotland.\xa0\n\nWhen asked who our biggest foe is, the first name that popped into his head was the EU?'
'Donald Trump, on no uncertain terms, is attacking democratic treaty allies. The only foe here is Putin, and his puppet.'
'I think the headline buries the lead here.\n\n In the CBS News interview, Mr. Trump also continued to criticize the special counsel\'s Russia investigation, saying it is having an impact on America\'s standing in the world. "I think we\'re greatly hampered by this whole witch hunt that\'s going on in the United States," the president said. "I think it hurts our relationship with Russia. I actually think it hurts our relationship with a lot of countries. I think it\'s a disgrace what\'s going on."\n\nHe is STILL criticizing the russia investigation. He said more negative things about the Russia investigation than the actual russian act of war. Fucking insane.'
"The EU and NATO are enemies. Putin and Kim are good friends.\n\nIt's insane how quickly we became the bad guys."
'Trump thinks everyone is a foe, he has a victim complex inwhich he believes everyone is out to get him unless you prove to him otherwise. he thinks this way because he built his fortune out to get/take advantage of everyone.\n\nThe news media is out to get him  \nObama was out to get him  \nThe FBI is out to get him  \nHillary is out to get him  \nCohen is out to get him (now)\nMuslims are out to get America (and by extension, him)  \nMexicans are out to get America (and by extension, him)  \nChina is pout to get America (and by extension, him) \nThe EU is out to get America (and by extension, him) \nCanada is out to get America (and by extension, him)  \n\nAnd here is the scary part; Liberals are already seen as his foe, but eventually, when bit more of  the American people turn on him, every citizen that opposes him will be seen as his enemy as well.\n'
'Has he hit every point yet? \n\nThe methodology of tyranny\n\n**Control of public information and opinion - It begins with withholding information, and leads to putting out false or misleading information. A government can develop ministries of propaganda under many guises. They typically call it "public information" or "marketing".**\n\nVote fraud used to prevent the election of reformers - It doesn\'t matter which of the two major party candidates are elected if no real reformer can get nominated, and when news services start knowing the outcomes of elections before it is possible for them to know, then the votes are not being honestly counted.\n\n**Undue official influence on trials and juries - Nonrandom selection of jury panels, exclusion of those opposed to the law, exclusion of the jury from hearing argument on the law, exclusion of private prosecutors from access to the grand jury, and prevention of parties and their counsels from making effective arguments or challenging the government.**\n\nUsurpation of undelegated powers - This is usually done with popular support for solving some problem, or to redistribute wealth to the advantage of the supporters of the dominant faction, but it soon leads to the deprivation of rights of minorities and individuals.\n\nSeeking a government monopoly on the capability and use of armed force - The first signs are efforts to register or restrict the possession and use of firearms, initially under the guise of "protecting" the public, which, when it actually results in increased crime, provides a basis for further disarmament efforts affecting more people and more weapons.\n\nMilitarization of law enforcement - Declaring a "war on crime" that becomes a war on civil liberties. Preparation of military forces for internal policing duties.\n\nInfiltration and subversion of citizen groups that could be forces for reform - Internal spying and surveillance is the beginning. A sign is false prosecutions of their leaders.\n\n**Suppression of investigators and whistleblowers - When people who try to uncover high level wrongdoing are threatened, that is a sign the system is not only riddled with corruption, but that the corruption has passed the threshold into active tyranny**.\n\nUse of the law for competition suppression - It begins with the dominant faction winning support by paying off their supporters and suppressing their supporters\' competitors, but leads to public officials themselves engaging in illegal activities and using the law to suppress independent competitors. \n\n**Subversion of internal checks and balances - This involves the appointment to key positions of persons who can be controlled by their sponsors, and who are then induced to do illegal things. The worst way in which this occurs is in the appointment of judges that will go along with unconstitutional acts by the other branches.**\n\n**Creation of a class of officials who are above the law - This is indicated by dismissal of charges for wrongdoing against persons who are "following orders".**\n\nIncreasing dependency of the people on government - The classic approach to domination of the people is to first take everything they have away from them, then make them compliant with the demands of the rulers to get anything back again.\n\nIncreasing public ignorance of their civic duties and reluctance to perform them - When the people avoid doing things like voting and serving in militias and juries, tyranny is not far behind.\n\nUse of staged events to produce popular support - Acts of terrorism, blamed on political opponents, followed immediately with well-prepared proposals for increased powers and budgets for suppressive agencies. Sometimes called a Reichstag plot.\n\nConversion of rights into privileges - Requiring licenses and permits for doing things that the government does not have the delegated power to restrict, except by due process in which the burden of proof is on the petitioner.\n\n**Political correctness - Many if not most people are susceptible to being recruited to engage in repressive actions against disfavored views or behaviors, and led to pave the way for the dominance of tyrannical government.**\n\nAvoiding tyranny - The key is always to detect tendencies toward tyranny and suppress them before they go too far or become too firmly established. **The people must never acquiesce in any violation of the Constitution**. Failure to take corrective action early will only mean that more severe measures will have to be taken later, perhaps with the loss of life and the disruption of the society in ways from which recovery may take centuries.\n\nhttp://www.constitution.org/tyr/prin_tyr.htm'
"It's deliberate propaganda, straight out of the fascist playbook, meant to muddy the waters and dilute the meaning of words.\n\nThe word foe becomes meaningless if it can be applied to our enemies and allies alike. We've seen this happening with other terms.\n\n*both sides are the same* = when the GOP is corrupt, lies, or subverts democracy: **So what? Dems do it too. Both sides are the same.**\n\n*You think America is so innocent?* = when Russia carries out an attack on American democracy to manipulate a presidential election in their favor: **So what? America does it too. So it's okay that Russia did it to us.**\n\n*The EU is a foe, Russia can be a foe in some respects* = Trump is actively working with Russia as an ally even though Russia directly attacked American democracy: **So what? All nations can be foes of the United States in some respects. The EU is technically a foe of the United States and we work with them. So why shouldn't we have a good relationship with Russia?**\n\nKeep in mind, this strategy isn't to convince or confuse the Left and those who stand against Trump, nor is it to convince or confuse the Trump cult.\n\nIt's meant for the large portion of the population that is currently apathetic to politics. The ones that are currently more concerned with funding Kylie Jenner's kick starter than fund a political candidate. \n\nSo that by the time they decide to pay attention, there will be no clear truth. The truth will be relative to whatever those in power say it is.\n\n> *We've always been at war with the EU. Russia has always been our ally.*"
'> "Well, I think we have a lot of foes. I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade. Now, you wouldn\'t think of the European Union, but they\'re a foe. Russia is foe in certain respects. China is a foe economically, certainly they are a foe. But that doesn\'t mean they are bad. It doesn\'t mean anything. It means that they are competitive," Mr. Trump said at his golf club in Turnberry, Scotland. \n\nThis is partly why Trump is the personification of capitalism. What gets in my way of profit and power is my enemy. Russia, China, the EU. Doesn\'t matter. Compete against me in any way, for anything, anywhere and you\'re a foe. In a world that is adversarial and capitalist by design this is exactly what you get right here.'
'Jesus fucking Christ. Seriously? \n\nAt what point are Republicans going to drop their party bullshit and realize this guy and his admin are Russian puppets?'
"In a related story, I think Donald J. Trump is a foe to society in general and the fact hate groups adhere to him is evidence of the fact. I think his oh-so-many bankruptcies as a private businessman are further evidence. I think his fucking moronic antics we've seen over and over again since his campaigning in 2016 started, just nails home the point."

'Hey Americans,\nI dont care who voted for this pos and who didnt. You as a society own this trainwreck of a president.\n\nSo: fuck you.'
'Hm. This is a hard one 🤔 On one hand, he’s a fucking moron. He called them a foe for trading, China for economic, and Russia for undetermined different things. He then said just because they are a foe doesn’t mean they are all bad, just competitive. This tells me he doesn’t know the what the fuck the severity is to call a country a foe of America.\n\nOne the other hand, he’s a god damn rotten petty pathetic liar. So he probably just wanted to call the EU a foe (because he has adopted Putin’s goals) and just said the other ones to try and make it seem thoughtful or matter of fact.  Later he’ll just say he never said that and that the video and audio of him saying it is fake news.\n\nProbably it’s a bit of both. He’s a god damn rotten petty pathetic liar who is also a fucking moron, so he ends up stepping on his own dick when he tries to talk about things beyond his 5th grader level of competence. '
'I\'m Canadian. TIL Europe is an American foe. Earlier i learned Canada is a security risk. And England has an ineffective Prime Minister. \n\nBut "Putin is OK". Trump\'s words. \n\nWTF is wrong with you, America? Do you know **anything** about the USSR, Russia, and Putin? You think you want him calling your shots? \n\nDisgusting. '
'WTF-- senility or projection: Trump now thinks his father Fred was born in Germany.\n\n>"[L]ook, EU is very difficult. I-I want to tell you. Maybe the thing that is most difficult -- don\'t forget both my parents were born in EU sectors okay? I mean my mother was Scotland, my father was Germany."\n\nFred Trump was born in New York City in 1905.\n\nTrump\'s grandfather Friedrich, was born in 1869 in Kallstadt, Bavaria.'
'What the fuck is going on? Trump is so compromised by Putin he is spouting his geopolitical agenda and ideals. Who thought the day would come when the president of the states would call the EU a foe. This is so ridiculous.'
"Dear EU friends: really, we know you are our friends. The Idiot didn't get a majority of the vote. We are horrified this person is speaking for us. We are at least as frightened about this as you are. Hold on. We know you are demonstrating. We know Charles and William refused to meet him. We're working it out as fast as we can. There's not a lot of excitement about having a civil war, but it's in the conversation.\n\nSend help."
"I feel like I'm in a car, and the driver stated he drives better when he's drunk.  Less then half the passengers in the car agreed to let him drive, but he's driving just the same.  If we try to stop him from driving, we get into an accident.  If we let him continue to drive, we get into an accident.  Meanwhile, he's doing damage to anything in his way, and endangering everyone."
"The fact those in power won't hold him accountable, and the sheer amount of misinformation given across the country via social media, fox news, GOP radio, and the Russians creates enough fear in the uneducated poor, who already have little/no say due to gerrymandering is actually really scary.\n\nAdditionally, I feel it's likely we won't be able to make any meaningful changes for 10-20 years when people start retiring.\n\nIt's a really sad Outlook for America.\n\nI'll continue to vote blue, though, even if it's not going to matter"

'The real headline is "Poll: 18 percent of dumb mother fuckers think Trump shouldn\'t testify under oath to Mueller."'
"Really doesn't matter. Under oath or simply an interview with Mueller, it is illegal to lie. He'll fuck up regardless of the setting."
"If he is innocent the investigation will prove it. He shouldn't have anything to worry about. Nixon ordered the break in to the DNC because he feared they held evidence of his treason. He did everything he could to stop or smear the investigation. Donald Trump is exhibiting the same behavior history has told us a President guilty of treason commits. The American people deserve to follow Robert Mueller's investigation to its conclusive end and accept the results, whether guilty or innocence. Any politician unwilling to pass a law to protect Mueller is complicit in obstruction of justice.  "

"What is the point of being under oath when the man doesn't respect the constitution, the law nor does he respect the truth.  It's meaningless to him."

'Trump is an enemy of the state so far as Russian attacks on our democracy are concerned, and will be until he is taken down.'
"Trump's job as US President is literally to protect the Constitution of the United State from all enemies, foreign and domestic.  \n\nThere is no doubt that Trump is guilty, at a minimum, of dereliction of duty.  He must be impeached and removed from office, and those who do not support this or, worse yet, fight against it, must explain why."
'From the article: \n\n“Reed asked each official whether they had received specific direction from Trump to blunt Russian meddling efforts during future elections. The officials indicated they had not received that directive from the president, but that **Trump expects them to carry out their intelligence duties, including getting ahead of threats from Russia and others.**”\n\nSo Trump didn’t need to specifically direct them to stop this threat by the Russians, because he has specifically directed them to stop ALL threat by the Russians. \n\nJesus Christ reddit, calm the fuck down, read the articles, and stop jumping to the worst possible outcomes based on FUCKING TITLES AND TOP COMMENTS ONLY! Think for yourself once in a blue moon. '
'It\'s not in republican interests to do so. If they lose seats then they will loudly question the validity of the election with such unprecedented foreign interference. If they retain a majority then Russian meddling will be more fake news. The whole "Trump may reject the results of the 2020 election and refuse to leave office if he loses" was put out there to gauge how the law & order, Constitution above all else conservatives would respond.'

Seriously what the fuck? How can people not CLEARLY see he's the villain in this story? Honestly, Trump's Russian  allegiance is MORE obvious than Senator Palpatine turning out to be Emperor Palpatine in episode 3."

Limited liability is founded on the opposite principle and permits a man to avail himself of acts if advantageous to him, and not to be responsible for them if they should be disadvantageous; to speculate for profits without being liable for losses; to make contracts, incur debts, and commit wrongs, the law depriving the creditor, the contractor, and the injured of a remedy against the property or person of the wrongdoer, beyond the limit, however small, at which it may please him to determine his own liability.  \n\nFor Mom and Pop shops, just fine, for billionaires to have 100's of these things, not so much.

'he molested countless girls in those dressing rooms and raped his first wife but the porn star is this big of a story.  HE MARRIED A PORN STAR!!'
"At this point, Republicans can't bring up the Bill Clinton blow job scandal anymore. They lost their privilege to use it because if they bring it up it's going to get invalidated by any number of one of Trump's sex scandals, this one especially. Oh, Clinton is morally depraved because he cheated on his wife? What's that make the guy who tried to bang two porn stars, who also cheated on his wife? You know that same guy who was recorded admitting he sexually assaulted women? That moral high ground the Republicans claim to have doesn't really seem to be a thing anymore."

'>Even police rarely use their sidearms and **must attain a black belt in judo** or other Japanese martial art before qualifying.\n\n>Journalist Anthony Berteaux told the BBC earlier this year: "What most Japanese **police will do is get huge futons and essentially roll up a person who is being violent or drunk into a little burrito** and carry them back to the station to calm them down."\n\nTaken together, this is the most Japanese thing I\'ve ever read - must have black belt to get gun; weapon of choice: giant futon for human burrito.'
'To own a gun in Japan, you must undergo a physical and mental evaluation.  Every year.  Your gun is also inspected for damage that might make it dangerous to use annually by the police.  You must also demonstrate competence on a firing range.  \n\nPerhaps a bit extreme, but it works for them.  '
'Of course Trump knows most shooters in Japan get cut down by samurai before they can hurt anyone.'
'Well no shit Japan hasn’t had any mass shootings.\n\nTo get a gun: \n\nYou need a license that requires an extensive physical and mental health check. A shooting range test where you must make hit at least 95% of the targets, and  you’re still only allowed to possess shotguns and air rifles. \n\nJapan also has a [high suicide rate ](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-33362387) so they have as many mental health issues as we do yet this shit doesn’t happen over there.\n\n'
'Population of Japan is 127 million, so you can\'t claim it\'s "too small to compare". It\'s smaller than the US, sure, but still in the hundreds of millions of people in a very small area.\n\n- Japan has [0.6 guns per 100 residents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country). The US has 101.\n\n- Japan has [0.06 firearms-related deaths per 100,000 residents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate). The US has 10.54.\n\nIn other words, it\'s _obviously_ a matter of culture and availability. Japan has no guns, needs no guns, and therefor doesn\'t kill people with guns. It\'s very simple and straightforward.\n\nNo matter in which other ways people kill people, which I don\'t deny will obviously still happen, the US could easily reduce the number of people killed with firearms by several orders of magnitude and still have a society that is safe, secure and prosperous. **It is possible!**'
'so, not a single day without embrassement. Instead of replying with the statement "mass shooting can happen everywhere he should have assured that more stricter gun control will be put in place. \n\nYes, I know Donald Trump and Republicans are against Gun Control But after so much mass shooting I think it a high time to change the strategy. \n\nIf Trumps doesn\'t tighten the gun control he will be hated forever '
'There are mass killings, however. Clearly not as frequent and deadly as in the US.   \n   \n1. The Sarin Attack 1995 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_subway_sarin_attack)  \n2. Akihabara Massacre 2008 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihabara_massacre)  \n'
"Japan has a population of 127 million and had 395 murders in 2014, that's 3 murders per 1 million people\n\nUSA has a population of 323 million and had 15,696 murders in 2015, that's 50 murders per 1 million people\n\nAnd Japan has no abundance of guns, what a strange coincidence..."
'Geez.  \nSaying shit like that to Japan should get him caned.  \nBetween the population murdering itself and the president murdering our reputation is there anything we won’t try and kill?'
"In my lifetime I think there have been three mass shootings in Britain. One before Dunblane which I don't remember, Dunblane which laws were changed and that Raul Moat guy. My uncle has rifle and hunts, farmers have shotguns and it seems to work fine. Yes criminals have guns and people get shot but they mainly shoot other organised criminals. Very rarely are people randomly shot."
"While I do think Trump's full of shit on this, it should be noted that Japan had a very deadly, regrettable event happen just last Summer. Approximately 19 people died after a mass stabbing in Samagihara, with 26 others being injured during the attack. \n\nOnce again, **Trump is absolutely full of shit**, but the idea that horrible, horrible things can happen anywhere is a real one. If you'd like to prevent things like this from happening here, however, please remember to call your local congressmen to voice your opinions and organize events in your area to raise awareness about your proposed solutions. Whether you're for or against gun control, there's nothing wrong with speaking out and trying to contribute to fixing a growing, festering problem in our country.\n\nRemember, **unless the people make it a priority, nothing will get done.**"
'Racist alt-righters claim this is because Japan is a country that is mostly racially homogeneous.'
'I wish I could hate him to death. '
"Guess he's wrong then, no way a mass shooting could ever happen there!"
"Just looking at the gun death (homicide and suicide) stats for Japan and South Korea it's more than likely that not one single person will die from a gun during his visit. Meanwhile here in the states more than 350 will die. \n\nUS vs Japan vs South Korea:\n\n[**homicide**](https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/compare/194/number_of_gun_homicides/91,170)\n\n[**suicide**](https://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/compare/194/number_of_gun_suicides/91,170)"
"That's either the most ignorant thing ever said or the most threatening. "
'"Even here in japan, you have biggly problems, how many times has a mech that has not been authorized been piloted by a teenage girl and destroyed half a city? What about giant mutant lizards illegally immigrating to your shores? '
' Fuck on both domestic and international issues. "How President Trump communicates with the outside is not something you need to worry about."'
'i feel like his follow-up statement about how the gunman would\'ve killed "hundreds more" without the other guy with a gun was probably much more insane and manipulative.'
'or terrorist attacks either!'
'muslim guy kills people in new york. Donald Trump says lets stop immigrants from coming into the usa , white guy kills people in a Texas church "not one word from Donald Trump"'
'To be fair, Japan does and has had a long standing problem with suicide. Mental health in Japan is definitely not what I would call up to par, despite the relatively rigorous standards of work and achievement that is imbued in their culture. People in that country suffer from mental illness and depression at high rates as well. It’s just not the thing to do, to shoot up a mall or a church. Theirs would rather hang themselves '

It\'s been discussed what he\'d accept as cause for him to resign, and health reasons top the list, along with "having already done everything he set out to do."\n\nPlease let this be the pretext for his resignation. Also, please let everyone in his administration end up in jail.\n\nEdit: For those concerned I *want* Pence to be president or am not aware he would become president, I don\'t and I am.

Thank you for your participation.'
'"Believe me, folks, I\'ve got to be,  no other president. That\'s what they tell me, right? No other president. They check me out, blood, tested the blood and it\'s the most they\'ve ever seen. Can you believe that? You could name a hundred presidents and none of them have as much chromosomes as me. Big genes I get, my uncle you know? Big genes, lots of chromosomes. Never before."'
"Unless it also includes a psychological and neurological exam, the results will be meaningless.  I don't care about his shitty blood pressure - I care about the fact that he's an imbecile that can't remember what he was told 2 minutes ago."
"This is a medical examination, not a mental health examination.\n\nTrump won't release information, especially since Obama's was outstanding and the comparative will make him look bad. Considering his diet, stress level and lack of physical activity, wanna' bet his cholesterol to HDL ratio, blood pressure and fasting glucose levels will be abominations and if they're not, it's because he takes a pharma salad?"
'For what it\'s worth, I don\'t actually think Trump is mentally ill. He\'s just unqualified. He\'s like any other 71-year-old Republican who watches Fox News all day and armchair quarterbacks American politics from their couch. Just like any other hard right conservative who trolls Twitter or Facebook all day, commenting on news stories with outlandish nonsense. People who get wrapped up in unimportant shit like football players kneeling instead of issues that actually matter. Just like anyone who consumes cable news and thinks complex issues have simple solutions. North Korea. "Wipe em\' out!" Immigration. "Build a wall!" Health care. "Free market!"\n\nThose people aren\'t mentally unwell in any medical way. Those are our parents and our grandparents. Those are the things my Uncle Mike who repairs motorcycles for a living says. They\'re things your grandfather who\'s a pediatrician talks about at dinner. They\'re not mentally ill. They\'re not even necessarily stupid. They\'re just misinformed by biased media, angry at the state of the country, have no political experience and are unqualified to be President of the United States.\n\nSo it\'s scary when the *actual* President of the United States is basically that person. He\'s not mentally ill. He\'s just not remotely qualified for the job he has. Global politics aren\'t hotels.'

'John McCain is a hero\n\n>In mid-1968, John S.

'Trump has never apologized for anything in his life even when he was clearly in the wrong, yet he demands apologies from other people like ESPN and that reporter.\n\nHell, Trump has yet to apologize for spreading the whole Obama "birther" conspiracy. \n\nHe is just a scumbag of catastrophic proportions. '
"Ahh yes, the person who is calling out athletes for not being patriotic enough doesn't see a problem with his own remarks criticizing McCain because he was a prisoner of war. The lack of awareness of his own hypocrisy never ceases to be mind-boggling."
'>"If I took offense at everybody who has said something about me, or disparaged me or something like that — life is too short,” he said. “And on an issue of this importance to the nation, for me to worry about a personal relationship, then I\'m not doing my job.”  \n  \n"But seriously," added McCain, "fuck that dimwitted asshole." '
"If Trump started apologizing right now for every stupid thing he ever said he'd die before finishing."
"\n It must have took great courage to survive 5 years in a Vietminh prison camp. I have the upmost respect for that.\nThat was in the 70s though. Since then you have advocated for wars that caused the deaths of thousands of your fellow Americans. Lied to the people of Arizona by campaigning on one promise after another and never full filling them or out right lying. You only get away with it is because you constantly claim your a war hero and how people can't criticize you because of you self imposed status. You advocated the arming of Syrian rebels which turned out to be Jihadi groups. Even after that was discovered you still wanted to sent them weapons. You refuse to release the names of the donors to the McCain foundation. Are people buying you off McCain?\nYou may been a war hero years ago, but now your just sad bitter old man."
"Everyone's got their brilliant idea to finally rid us of Trump. I'm not going to pretend I'm any smarter than them, but I feel strongly that the solution to him is to stick to one indefensible thing he's done and ignore everything else.\n\nBanning trans people in the military? Won't stick because some people don't get trans culture.\n\nBanning Muslims? Some people are scared of Muslims, lots of people. Won't stick.\n\nForgiving a borderline Nazi sheriff?

No one saw that coming but for whatever reason it won't stick.\n\nMcCain though is a war hero that was tortured until he lost the full use of his arms and came back to this country to serve in government. You may not agree with his policies, but you can't deny that he sacrificed a lot.\n\nTrump took that quintessentially American value, and mocked McCain for being captured at war. In doing so he attacked what Americans stand for fundamentally and whatever side of the fence you're on you can't defend that. It should be brought up constantly. Non-stop.\n\nNext week Trump might punt a baby. Who cares, report on it for a second then go back to talking about Trump mocking American prisoners of war. Be relentless and stick to it.

"He hasn't apologized for a lot of things. His strategy is to divert attention from a scandal with a new scandal. Tax returns? We're focusing on Russia. Russia? We're focusing on racism? Racism? We're focusing on his poor handling of the hurricanes. Hurricanes? We're focusing on his UN speech. We never linger on a single point, and so it doesn't really get to process, and it normalizes his actions."
"it's not whether or not you were a hero that should be the offensive issue.   It should be that he held your capture against you\nYou were a prisoner of war, and he acted like that made you a lesser man.   Of course Trump wouldlook down upon the weak, the sick, and  the vulnerable.  That's who he is.  "

"Finally.\n\n  \n\n\nIve said this before as a Canadian, although probably not on reddit, but that I saw America as being basically complicit in what Trump was doing. I know the majority didn't vote for him but the only time there has been serious wide scale protests against him specifically was when he took office. After, nearly all the protests were about policies or actions they had taken as the administration. People were still angry but no one was doing anything other than complaining.\n\n  \n\n\nThis protest is what I've been wanting people to do. I have even specifically mentioned occupy wall street in the past. Not as an effective campaign, but at least one that was standing for an ideal rather than a political decision. This ideal being that Trump is a racist bigot and doesn't represent the majority of Americans.\n\n  \n\n\nProtests do make a difference whether people like it or not. Look at all the protests that murdered the Obamacare repeal. Everyone crumbled despite them owning all branches of government.\n\n  \n\n\nLet this protest go on for as long as needed. If you have the time, go to the protest when you can. Go to one locally. Show you're sick of this shit. Commenting online doesn't do much when you can directly show your representatives that if they fuck with you, they will lose. You don't have to stand in the protest to make a difference either. Hell, bring down markers and poster board for people to make their own signs. Do what you can to make this as effective as fucking possible and make the politicians who still fear their political lives realize that trump is going away. You fucking aren't."

"whatever his business acumen may or may not have been, this man is mentally unfit to run our country. It is entirely unacceptable to confuse two mass shootings, defend coal, sexually assault women, instigate a cold war with a hermit country, negate climate change science and i'm sure others could continue this list until he dies of a heart attack. Seriously this man should not be in office."
"Unfortunately it's still too soon for the articles to get anywhere.\n\nRepubs need to realize they'll be killed in the 2018 elections if they don't do anything - or more likely, we'll have to wait for a Dem majority in the House."
"Reposting.\n\nI'm against this. When you constantly bring it up knowing that nothing will come from it you undermine the credibility of the left and you fuel the narrative that they/we have been seeking impeachment from day one.\n\nWait until Dems have control next year. Wait until Mueller publicly displays the smoking gun. Wait until removal is a slam dunk. By the time impeachment has a legitimate chance we will have watered down the movement so much it will barely be potent enough to succeed and will be tainted such that republicans will call it a left wing conspiracy not a justified defense of democracy.\n\nStop using something this important for political optics.\n"
'So is their goal here to push off what seems inevitable?  Trying to get past 2018?\n\nPersonally it seems to me that trump is a liability to the GOP.  His very pressence will get more democrats to vote and I think that will go badly for them.  \n\nJust some armchair politicing'
'How are people not seeing the value of this? This speaks to America and everyone really the walls of discontent closing in around Trump. Redditors can remark all they want "nothing burger" or "it\'s to soon", but when you\'re the man in question and you see every day what\'s arrayed against you it has to get to you. Trump can\'t just, atleast behind closed doors, shrug things like this off. Testing the waters like this is America\'s voice, show it support.\n\nThe world is arrayed against Trump. Being cynical won\'t help bring this treasonous son of a bitch to Justice.'
'It is fine to move forward with these little efforts, but we do not want Trump impeached. Right now, Trump\'s batshit crazy antics are what is fueling the turnaround, and don\'t forget that the Trumpsters and establishment GOP are NOT divided. Unless Pence and Ryan go down with Trump, we do not want to impeach Trump. \n\nPence is establishment GOP and things would appear much calmer under a Pence presidency. But the scary part is that the fire would die down and Pence would work with the GOP to accomplish some really scary shit. All the climate-change denial crap funded by the Koch brothers would have a path forward. And without the crazy antics of Trump taking full enter stage, I would be very concerned that the resistance that has helped fuel some recent democratic wins would die down significantly. Pence would appear very "business as usual" but would be anything but. We\'re better off with four full years of Trump where the biggest accomplishments would be the dems coming together and winning back the house and/or Senate. But we DO NOT want Trump impeached. Trust me.'
'You posters are hilarious, but reality is a bitch. Nothings going to happen.'
"Stop. Doing. This. And the reasons why are a *little* bit about Mueller but mainly about the fact that at least until January 2019 *we still have a GOP controlled congress.*\n\nWhat the hell is the point of impeaching now? Even on the extreme off chance that the articles pass the House (ha!) you would need *18* Republicans to flip in the Senate to get to the 66 votes you'd need to remove Trump from office. That. Is. Impossible. And its not even a guarantee that all the Democrats would vote in the affirmative. If his actual removal is your ambition than you either do it right or you don't do it at all. "
'Look: We all want this. We all want this idiotic ride to end.\n\nBut right now? Not the time. Let Mueller do his work cause it appears he is almost ready to drop the hammer on everyone.\n\nWe need to worry about the Senate trying to pass a tax bill with Obamacare being destroyed as part of the deal. Call your reps cause that is more important right now.'
"The biggest problem with impeaching Trump is that you actually have somebody worse than Trump to take over.  Pence is just as big a disaster and he wants to turn the clock back 100 years.  We need to get Pence out of office before we impeach Trump.  We might as well elect Roy Moore to the presidency because Pence is just like him.  Maybe he's not a Sexual predator but he's completely bat shit crazy!"

"My best friend worked free lance there.

Every single bit. I don't even know what my point was but it was a very hard day knowing that I could of found out on FB that the light of my life was killed. The relief, mixed with guilt consumed me. \n\nThe flag should always be half mast. We are a country in mourning. Every second of every day. "
"Unpopular opinion: lowering the flag ought to be reserved for truly nationwide attacks or tragedies, like Pearl Harbor or 9/11, or JFK getting shot. The reason is that this country goes through waves of domestic terrorism: I can recall at least one from the 1800s (Haymarket riots), and I think there was one in the early 1900s and then another in the 70s and 80s. I remember reading in the Wall Street Journal that something like 3,000 bombings happened in a single year in the early 70s. But we didn't have a 24-hour news cycle that gave local or regional stories a nationwide audience. Hell, I don't think they even lowered it after the University of Texas tower shooting, one of the first mass shootings in U.S. history. The Capital Gazette shooting is a tragedy, but lowering the flag for only the most grievous of tragedies makes the ceremony more powerful."
"I'm actually an advocate for us not lowering the flag except in the more traditional circumstances.  It used to be that we only lowered the flag when an extremely senior official died, or some extreme national event occured.  When I saw the flag was lowered, you would ask around and find out who died.\n\nOften now, I actually have to dig around to discover just why the flags have been lowered.  If they have been lowered officially, or as part of a local thing (which I disagree with, as it's a national flag), or  just the flag owner's personal discretion as to what requires a statement of mourning.\n\nThat's not to say that this was not a horrific event and that the statements of the Administration haven't added to a really terrible and disturbing situation where journalists are held up as the enemy.  I just tend to be someone who feels that the flag should only be lowered in extreme states of national mourning, and believe that it has been lowered too often which lessens the impact when it is lowered.\n\nIn a way, because we have lowered it so often, it bothers me because an event like this is one in which an exception to the rule would make an exceptionally powerful statement."
'Fuck him, lower your flags anyways. Spread the word. '
"He can't order the flags be lowered, in memory of an incident, he called for. He has said that the Press is an enemy to the United States, he has continually rebuked the press as fake, he has called for the incarceration of journalists that report negative things. He has pushed a narrative that the Press is at war with America and our freedoms. He literally started this."
'In 2018, the flag has been ordered to half staff (according to http://us.halfstaff.org/), for the following reasons:\n\n* Honoring the Victims of the Tragedy in Parkland, Florida\n* in Honor of Billy Graham\n* in Honor of Barbara Bush\n* Honoring the Victims of the Tragedy in Santa Fe, Texas\n* Memorial Day\n\nSo we\'ve honored victims of shootings more than once this year by lowering flags nationally to half-staff, but not **these** victims. The question must be asked, "Why are these shooting victims different?" Is it because there simply weren\'t enough victims, or because they were "enemies of the people" according to those holding the reins of power?'
"My god. How much more shit has to be flung by this man before people start realizing he is a phony.  He does not care about the country, about the military about the trade deficit.

'What a fucking idiot and an embarrassment to our country. '
'What the fuck could be polarizing about this? Is it because journalists that got killed or is it because ammosexuals will do their usual bullshit?'

"Honestly, its gotten to the point where I wouldn't feel sad if Trump got assassinated.\n\nI know, it's quite grim to be ok with your President to be killed, but the guy is scum of the earth. I don't care if Mike Pence, or any other Republican or Democrat had become president. It's just Trump himself is poison to our country.\n\nIf Trump just... vanished, the world would be a bit better off.\n\nI know I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this, but I just needed to get it off my chest. So, let the downvotes and insults commence. "
"Acting in a way to express grief would require that he acknowledge that something is wrong with mass shootings. Trump thinks shootings are a good thing. Everyone who has had the power to stop mass shootings and didn't has done so because they believe they are a good thing.\n\nTHE SUITS DO NOT CARE IF WE, THE PEOPLE LIVE OR DIE."
"He reaffirms his status as a fake president.\n\nPresident Diapers got his feelings hurt by the media not coddling him, so he can't every support them."
'I remember when the president would address things that the nation is concerned about. Many may see a psycopath shooting up a newspaper but a lot of people see the presidents and the rights attack on the press inflaming hate against the press and then this happens. \n\nNow, no one will ever know if they are connected but, when a president wants to unite a nation, they will address  these concerns and at least lower the flag etc. It is such a simple non partisan act that there is really no reason not too.\n\nThis is my main issue with trump. He takes every chance to demonize half the countries political beliefs and doesnt do simple jestures that assure its citizens like, lowering the flag and showing that the rhetoric against the free press is never to be misconstrued as a call to violence or calling out white supremacists after killing an innocent protester to ensure people that hate has no place here and would not be tolerated or putting in place sanctions that both houses of congress voted for to ensure the nation he wasnt put in place by a hostile foriegn power. \n\nBut he doesnt. These simple non partisan things would help this nation from dividing even further yet he doesnt do it even though this is becoming a larger problem everyday. \n\nThe only people hurt by our nation dividing further is ourselves. You can see it as "winning" or whatever you want but know your nieghbors are being pushed away. This will keep  getting worse and the damage this will do will ring for years to come. The pillar will swing back the other way and it wont be kind. Nobody wants this. This just weakens us all. \n\nAnd before anyone points to the free press and blames them for inciting hysteria remember, this is easily correctable.

It\'s like open your fucking eyes, if the Republicans genuinely want more research on climate change to prove it then why the fuck are they defunding all the groups that would supply that evidence.\n\nI mean it would be like me claiming that Asbestos might not actually be that bad for you and removing regulations on it, then banning all the laboratories that research the health effects of it.'
'There are only 2 reasons to oppose action on climate change: You make money off of fossil fuels or you are willfully ignorant of the fact of climate change.

'>Later in the day Ms Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, the other Republican senator for Alaska, allegedly received calls from the Department of the Interior warning them that the state’s future was now under consideration.\n\nPetty fuckers running the White House '
"threatining Alaska with isolation is like threatining London with rain, Germany with efficency and the Mets with bad baseball.\n\nIt's their core quality dummy!"
'He has absolutely no respect for the institution of the US government and the importance of checks and balances whatsoever.  \n\nThis is an authoritarian stuck in a non-authoritarian government.  And I mean that very seriously.  Not like the whiny, misinformed nonsense that people accused Obama of.  This is a *real* authoritarian who will burn down what he can to gain more power.  '
'... and nobody is stopping this moron ?'
"Hahahaha. Fuck off Trump. I hope she laughed at that Department of the Interior stooge. Despite all the tweets and hot air billowing from that orange fuck's face, nothing has happened. There is no wall. Obamacare repeal just got defeated.... again, transgenders are still waking up on American military bases across the world. He's done NOTHING. Just throw temper tantrums like a spoiled idiot child. Fuck off Trump. "
'Trump panders to a core of conservatives whose values aren\'t as much American as they are pre-medieval European. \n\n"Conservative" often means preferring a current or even historical status quo and resisting change or novelty. There is a core of conservatives who have always preferred the status quo of, say, 1000 a.d. Britain.\n\nThe rule of law has only recently become the way most of the world works. In past times there were other rules, like the rule of various deities, the rule of monarchy (usually representing the deities), etc. In early- and pre-medieval Britain conflicts were often resolved among and within tribes and communities with vendettas, blood feuds, etc. You raped my sister? I\'ll rape yours. You killed my brother? I\'ll kill two of yours, and so on. Importantly, concepts like personal and family "honor" were vengeable things: if your "honor" were threatened, that was a reason for retaliating with violence. Same with your family\'s "honor" or your clan\'s "honor." This system was stable for a very long time, but "stable" doesn\'t mean "peaceful;" it was incredibly violent.\n\nOver time, as clan chiefs began to consolidate territories and make bigger kingdoms, those "kings" now wanted some protection from being caught up in this endless cycle of death and blood swirling around any given village they might be visiting. "[The King\'s Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_law)" or "The Peace of the King" became a thing. This meant, at least at one point, that a certain radius of distance around the king must be peaceful--say, 100 yards, or a mile, or something. No violence allowed within that circle, even if you had a really good reason. If you ignored that rule, then *you* were punished, despite the fact that you were probably just dishing out some much-deserved justice! Crazy!\n\nEventually, this concept was [incorporated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_peace) into English Common Law, which was the basis for modern English law and American law (the idea that our laws were originally biblical is utter bullshit). After a few centuries, this "rule of law" really took off, to the point where even kings and queens could sometimes be threatened with "the law." Audacious! A very important part of this Rule of Law goes straight back to the Peace of the King: the state has a monopoly on violence. Nobody gets to commit violence except when authorized by the government. Cops, soldiers, secret service... they can do it; you can\'t. In return, the state will step in and make things right(ish) by punishing the people who need punishing (on your behalf, sort of), either by dishing out violence (e.g., capital punishment or, in the past, beatings, etc.) or collecting fines (this is another thousand-year-old legal innovation that transformed the world). Bizarrely, *you don\'t get the money* from such fines... they go to the government. What a world we live in.\n\nThere have always been people (entire surviving subcultures, really) in England and the US who don\'t really buy this. They want to have the right to be violent on *their* terms, when *they* want to, and consider government punishment for this to be oppression. They especially want to have the right to take vengeance when they are wronged. This is a very, very old idea, and (see above) it can have disastrous social consequences. But it\'s never really gone away. How many cop movies have the protagonist committing unlawful vengeance while his cop buddies turn a blind eye? How many action heroes decide they have to "take the law into their own hands?"\n\nTrump, since the beginning of his candidacy, has openly appealed to this parallel value system in America. He models vindictiveness (i.e., vengeance) on an almost daily basis. He retaliates. He punishes. And he\'s not doing it on behalf of some conceptual "government" or some abstract "America," he\'s doing on his own behalf. He retaliates for every slight, perceived or real, against himself. He lets no insult go unanswered. He retaliates to the extent he is able, whether that is just verbally lashing out or threatening careers, lives, and livelihoods. He doesn\'t let things go. He holds grudges. He\'s a one-man rolling ball of blood feuds, with the tallies constantly updating in his head.\n\nAnd he\'s all about the "honor." You don\'t have to actually harm Trump to incur his vindictive stankeye; you just have to insult him. Give him insufficient "respect." Fail to celebrate him sufficiently. I think this fits with his personality, of course; it\'s not just a political act. But it is *also* a political act. \n\nTrump works every day to be something other than an American president; he works to be a medieval warlord. His core followers eat it up, so he makes sure to give them lots of it. He never lets the public see him back down... from *anything*. Although he is clearly weak in various political, personal, and psychological ways, he never shows the kind of weakness that loses staredowns in locker rooms. He pushes, and he never gets pushed back; if he does, he clobbers until the other guy doesn\'t get up. \n\nHis core supporters eat this up like cake for breakfast. I think it goes without saying that, left unchecked, this will destroy America. England was destroyed, constantly and repeatedly, for centuries, until a painful, slow, gradual process created the rule of law. The rule of law saves us.\n\n*Edit (about 8 hours later)*: Heh heh. Watching the upvote count reverse and start to count downward, now that the Trump supporters got their notifications that someone on the interwebs had threatened their clan chief\'s honor.'
'Vindictive bully who has no clue how to govern. '
'I will honestly be surprised if political satire survives this Presidency. Any satire that isn\'t over the top enough to convey mockery is usually subject to Poe\'s Law and every day presents a new low that you thought wasn\'t possible. Yesterday, despite the already asinine list of things this administration is known for, the idea of the Government disowning a state, especially for something so extremely petty, would have been something you used to mock people for being hyperbolic.\n\n"Wow, Trump is so evil, maybe he\'ll cut off Alaska and eat their babies!"\n\nThankfully, only one half of that sentence is now non-satirical.

We have only one insurance provider on the exchange, and my bronze plan will go from $100 a month to $1,400 a month without subsidies, and that's before the $11,000 deductible ($5,500 each for my wife and I) and even after that it is 30*%* co-insurance for in network stuff and generic prescriptions.  Which means currently it's $12,200 for premiums and deductibles for us before insurance pays a cent.  That would rise to $27,800 before it pays a cent, per year.  Our entire income before taxes is about $48,000 and we have a mortgage, bills, property taxes, food, vehicle and home insurance, home security, etc to worry about.

"I think i'm starting to understand how this investigation is working.\n\nThey're going backwards from the transition team meetings to get cooperation. The lead in question to the overall investigation is now: Why did the Trump administration pursue the removal of these sanctions aggressively, and then ask the FBI to stop talking to transition members who participated in doing so?\n\nBecause the Logan Act isn't going to be used to prosecute anyone. The transition team contacts with foreign ambassadors is about the why and not the when. And the why is important, because the Trump administration has lied about these contacts numerous times to both the media and now FBI. If this was normal business, the administration would have no need to conceal the fact that they did this, as past administrations have clearly made overtures to foreign governments during their transition period in the past.\n\nBy getting Flynn to turn, you now have access to all of Flynn's records about these meetings.  You have access to all of his financial records and his emails with Trump campaign and administrative staff. You also now have the ability to bring connected parties in for the same line of questioning, re: Kushner. \n\nThey'll then be able to compare notes with Flynn's testimony and records, and if Kushner lied during their previous interview, will then have leverage to get him to add further to the larger investigation, which isn't about these supposed Logan Act violations at all. I also still haven't seen a coherent defense of this from the right, yet. \n\nRemember something important here: Trump's primary objective when asking James Comey to stop investigating tampering in the 2016 election was to get the FBI to not prosecute Michael Flynn, and now Flynn's lawyers have made him a witness for the government. \n"

'in his apology following the release of the video, he did not mention that the video was fake... strange. \nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2016/10/07/politics/donald-trump-women-vulgar/index.html\n\nnor did he mention that the video was fake in his twitter response.\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CuOD8cVWAAEkJR4.jpg\n\nyou would think he would have stood up for himself durring such a critical point in the campaign, and explained then, that the video was fake. \n'
'The most fucked up thing about this whole thing is that Bush got fired while Trump got elected president. \n\nThe guy who admitted to doing those things l, and facing accusations of sexual assault from 20 different women, became president. The man who laughed at Trump on the bus, because that’s what he was paid to do, lost his job. Un-fucking-real.'
"This whole thing is so fucking delicious. Stupid, awful, a complete embarrassment, but delicious as well. Go on Trump, call Billy Bush a liar now. Keep backing yourself into a corner, you repugnant little, orange fuck. Keep lashing out and losing your grip until you're yanked out of the White House and you and your cohorts are exposed for the treasonous bottom feeders you all are.  "
"Billy Bush was only fired when it became public.  \n\nMy question is: how long did any executive there know about the information?  I find it hard to believe they found out when everyone else did.  It's also not like they did the right thing to begin with, as evident apparently with Matt Lauer."
'Absolutely sickening a man with 10+ sexual assault accusations is our president and his supporters refuse to acknowledge the victims.'
'Yeah, there\'s simply no way to accurately describe the level of stupid that is, in every way, Trump. Anyone who cares to attempt to defend him, please do. Perhaps we should hold a contest for someone to accurately describe the idiocy that is the travesty of the Trump Regime, in every way. I mean, imbecile, shit-for-brains, and moron, don\'t even begin to describe this asshole. Defend him. I double, triple, and quadruple dare against such arguments to the contrary. And, I won\'t even be derogatory towards any such attempt. The guy is such a motherfucking disaster (And, I mean that he wouldn\'t even refrain from having sex with a direct family member), beyond which, nothing can ever justify. Rebut, if you can. The guy gives "shit" a bad name.'

'No shit'
"We all know based on the election that Trump's base doesn't care about facts and evidence. They care about feelings. What fucking pisses me off though is that Congress allegedly cares about facts and evidence, and they don't give a shit that Trump sexually assaulted women for decades. "

'You sound like you’re losing your shit over this.\n\nThere IS evidence that Russia interfered with our elections. There is also evidence that Trump met with Russians about “adoptions”. This is code for lifting sanctions. Trump asked Russia live on TV to hack the DNC, and they did.\n\nIt may be impossible to verify 100% of the dossier, but 80% of it is believed to be true. The dossier is a map of where to look. The investigation is looking into whether or not Trump obstructed justice by trying to derail the investigation.\n\nSo, if your argument is that we can’t prove that the dossier is 100% verifiable, then you’re in for a rude awakening. This isn’t about the dossier completely. This is about Trumps actions to derail the investigation. This is about what he knew and when, of Flynn and Manafort’s actions in regards to working with Russia while Russia was trying to hurt Hillary and sway our election. The investigation is also likely to reveal Trump’s shady business dealings with Russian mafia and money laundering.'
'And thus why the RNC is trying to discredit thee entire investigation, they are co-conspirators and have been flooded with dirty ass Russian money, and laundered the fuck out of it.'

'This is just the billionth example that Trump is utilizing the same "Fascism 101" playbook that the likes of Putin also use. It\'s disgusting and despicable. I\'m surprised that he didn\'t flat out say that all of the Americans who boycotted his speech or don\'t like him are treasonous - we can\'t be far off from that at this point.\n\nAnd yet - silence from the majority of Republicans in Congress. It\'s actually terrifying. '
'There\'s an old manga (Japanese comic) I loved as a kid called Hikaru no Go. In the early chapters, it tells the story of an adviser to the Emperor who played the game Go against another man who was competing for the position. The adviser notices the man make a move that\'s blatantly cheating, and just as he opens his mouth to protest, the cheating man yells first, "Look, he just played an illegal move! He\'s trying to cheat!"\n\nThis starts a short argument because, of course, it was the Emperor\'s adviser who had done no wrong and was trying to bring attention to injustice. The Emperor, annoyed by the bickering and offended that either of them would dare cheat in this match for his honor, tells them to continue play. He treats both players as the same, and does not bother to investigate either\'s claim. The adviser loses the match in the end, irreparably set back due to the cheating man\'s illegal move. Having lost his prestigious position, depressed and angry at what had just happened to him, he later takes his own life.\n\nI doubt anyone will read this comment, but I just wanted to say that every time the GOP projects and spins their bullshit, I am reminded of this story. Evil men get away with this all the time, in fiction and in real life. If you know you\'re doing something wrong, just accuse the other person first. It works. We live in an era of false equivalence and a disregard for the truth.'

"The guy accused of colluding with a foreign power to throw the election his way, and who seems to be paying that foreign power by refusing to enact sanctions passed overwhelmingly in a bipartisan manner, a man, who continues to try and undermine the institutions that made our democracy work, while dividing us by trying to turn many of us into scapegoats for the problems of those that have been neglected by both parties, he has the gall to call anyone else treasonous? I could think of a few choice words to call him, but for some reason a name keeps sticking in my mind when I think of Trump, Benedict Arnold, though I guess that's insulting to Arnold, I mean, the guy actually fought and was wounded in the service of his country before abandoning us, whereas Trump's war was merely avoiding STDs during the 1970s ans 80s. "
'He always accuses everyone of doing what he is doing. \n\nCrooked Hillary, lying Ted, fake news, unAmerican and treasonous. \n\nIt makes sense because that man only ever looks at mirrors. '

"It will be ...interesting, in a driving-by-the-accident sort of way, to see how the next couple of weeks plays out.

'Trump is a moron.  \n\nIn my humble opinion, anyone who was unable to make that simple assessment of the man upon casual observation is likewise a moron.  \n\nSo, unless there is some legitimate reason that "non-morons" would vote for a true moron for president, I live in a country where nearly half of the people who bother to vote are morons. This is very depressing.'

He unites people in hatred against him, so that everything he wants, we're likely to get the opposite of, because people are coming together just to do the reverse to spite him.\n\nThis is reverse psychofuck-you-ery on a global scale, and.

I wanna be POTUS. I know I can do a less shitty job than Trump. "
"Most Trump voters are going to write off this book as fabrication and slander - I'm not even sure the tapes will convince them. \n\nIn my view, the most fascinating impact will be on Donald Trump's mind. He won't be able to avoid some of the more salient points. Firstly, being forced to confront your own mental health can be an extremely difficult process. \n\nBut secondly, this book implies that EVERYONE in the WH is stabbing him in the back. I don't believe he'll be able to shrug this off, and it's an impossible situation to deal with. I think it's going to be the final nail in the coffin for his ability to work with his team - he may end up completely isolating himself, and that could make him more dangerous, but it could also make him more useless.

Even when he distorted the truth, manipulated the facts, and insulted the intelligence of decent people, they stood by him. In their sadism, they did this as it incensed their enemies (a.k.a liberals). They derived pleasure from the degradation of human decency, disdain for proper journalistic integrity, and the advocacy of alternative facts. Now that Trump is at the end of all that they have allowed, they are outraged. Hypocrites. If you spend the first year of your presidency peddling falsehoods, do not be surprised when these come back to bite you in the butt. Trump and his cult are reaping what they sowed. '
'Reading excerpts from this book... the whole Trump presidency thing is finally making sense, and it\'s even more terrifying than I thought (the whole thing being set up for post-Hillary publicity).  Sounds like it was also terrifying for the Trump team.  I know his supporters complain about the "deep state" or whatever but in this case, I feel the intelligence communities were rightfully concerned of a national security risk with a Trump victory.  They didn\'t try to block or impede it, because he actually was voted in, but it would be scary if they *weren\'t* concerned with the implications.'
"1. Yes, Trump is insanely stupid and horrible for America.\n\n2. Every time I see shit about how ridiculous he and his administration are, it blows my mind that such a significant portion of Americans voted for him and still support him. \n\nThis is the American President. Astounding. And America appears to have no meaningful way to quickly get rid of him. \n\nAll this evidence piles up, but each revelation seemingly does nothing but normalize the stupidity. \n\nWhat was the voter turn out in the election that he won? Of that %, how many voted for him? People always remind me that only a small percentage of America voted for him, but what that says to me, is that American democracy is SO weak, that this small percentage can elect an idiot like this; that for all the boasts of democracy, America largely doesn't care enough to vote or change the system in any meaningful way. \n\nGod fucking damn it. :( "
'That’s the book out on audible now. He’s completely moronic. I hadn’t heard about it until Wednesday. Was certainly not going to buy it when the Bannon excerpts came out.

It was a monstrous thing, it followed the logic of a terrorist.\n\nNow Trump is doing *exactly* the same thing.\n\nNotice this. Remember this. This isn't just about immigration policy. It's the implementation of a particular type of politics, a particular world-view. It's establishing Russian kleptocracy and gangsterism as a new American Normal. It's deploying terrorist logic and terrorist tactics against our own government."

He did this out of revenge to hurt the child's parents who had a legal dispute with Fred Trump's estate.\n\nDonald Trump thrills at the idea of showing people how far he will go for revenge.  The idea that he would harm a child to get revenge almost sexually excites him because of the ruthlessness of it lets you know what a formidable opponent he is.  He wants you to know he will stop at nothing, holding a child's life hostage, to get his pound of flesh."
'This is what I want more of, Democrats calling out Trump and his administration for exactly what it is: utter ridiculous bullshit. '
'International law requires that refugees fleeing a country & seeking asylum do so in the very first country they enter, providing that country will not continue to persecute them. In the instances of the Central, South & Latin American refugees, that country would be Mexico. \n\nBut Mexico advises the refugees NOT to request asylum (because Mexico will deny the request) and if the request is denied, the refugee is required to go back to their country of origin. But something else is being violated here. Mexico (under International law) is NOT permitted to refuse a legitimate request for asylum nor are they permitted to send the asylum seeker back into harms way.\n\nBut if the request for asylum is not legitimate and substantiated, then Mexico is free to refuse them. Which is what they are doing.\n\nIn these instances the refugees are advised, educated and assisted in making their way to the US. Those that are legitimate refugees with substantiating reasons for seeking asylum...reasons that should allow them to be granted asylum by the US, are directed & assisted by the Mexican government to specific & official border checkpoints. In certain instances, Mexico delivers them to the checkpoint!\n\nThose that have no hope of attaining asylum however, because their requests are fraudulent, are advised, educated and assisted by the Mexican government as to the best location and times to sneak across the US Border illegally, such to minimize the chances of being caught, detained and deported. They are advised that if they are captured, to immediately request asylum.\n\nBut when a foreign national is caught illegally crossing the US border, they are detained by border patrol and placed in a temporary holding facility. wherein they are processed and eventually deported. If the illegal alien has children with them, the process is markedly different.\n\nThe parents (or adult guardians) and the children are housed together (at US taxpayer expense) for twenty days. During those twenty days they are advised as to the laws they have broken and they are provided with numerous options to remedy their plight.\n\nThey are permitted (without being charged with a crime) to re-cross the border (with their children) into Mexico and make their way to an official checkpoint where they can legally and appropriately seek asylum.\n\nIf they refuse that option, and decide to remain in detention, they are told they will be charged with a felony and detained awaiting a deportation order from a US court. The order can take up to several months because of the back log.\n\nDuring that time, their children will be removed from their custody & placed elsewhere because US & International law forbids the housing or co-mingling of children in adult detention facilities. The children will be placed with other family members currently residing legally in America or with a licensed foster facility until such time as the deportation order is received and executed. At the time of deportation the children are reunited with the parents and taken back across the border as a family through a reciprocity agreement the US has with Mexico.\n\nThe illegal aliens are advised NUMEROUS times within those 20 days that they will be charged with felony border crossing should they not return to Mexico voluntarily. In so denying this option, they are told their chances of every getting into the US legally are eliminated.\n\nYou see, these people are advised quite well as to their situation and their options. They are treated fairly and humanely. At anytime during the twenty day detention they can opt to return to Mexico voluntarily and attempt to enter the US through proper means and channels, this avoiding a criminal record in the US.\n\nChildren are NOT being ripped away from their parents. If the children are removed it is because the parent chose for that to happen.\n\nAt no time is the enforcement of these laws, rules and protocols in any way harsher or more frequent then what took place under other presidents. It is just more politically convenient under President Trump.'
'> Homeland Security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has repeatedly said the Trump administration is required by law to detain and prosecute all immigrants entering the US illegally. She therefore has no choice, she says, but to separate parents and children during detention. But that’s not actually true—in fact, detaining asylum-seekers goes against both her agency’s own policy and international law.\n\nhttps://qz.com/1309188/trumps-family-separation-policy-nielsens-detainment-claim-is-challenged-by-two-rules/'
'Good to hear a Senator coming out and saying exactly what\'s happening. Some people could figure it out if they were paying attention (I\'d think most of us here), but some need it laid out like this. \n\nWarren and others (Kerry comes to mind) must be just boiling inside watching this administration destroy everything they\'ve worked for. As such I\'m not surprised when I hear "stupid wall" come out of a senator\'s mouth. '
"Oh for fucks sake. That wall will never be built. You know how much illegal immigration and the flow of drugs drives the US economy?? \n\nIf we somehow magically ended the drug trade and illegal immigration. Do you know how many people would be out of jobs. Trump doesn't want this wall built. Neither does any politician in the US from any party.\n\nIt's too much of a talking point during election time, that panders to a fucking stupid base."
'Is she the only one being vocal about the bullshit lies and twisted agenda coming out of the White House? Can we please get rid of Chuck Schumer? I’m frustrated with most Democrats right now. Trump is telling everyone who will listen that this family separation policy is on the democrats, and no one is standing up to him. This is not a difference of opinion, this is the difference between the truth and a lie. We are losing our soul because why again? No one is willing to stand up to this asshole and his asshole cronies.'
'Fuck the GOP! Fuck the Nazi Donald Trump! Protest these scumbags!'
'Isn’t this straight up terrorism? Using fear to get political change?'
'I’m all for the wall being stupid, but I’m not following how that’s the big issue everyone’s focused on after reading this. Can we talk about how this zero policy law that can literally be changed with the snap of one old wrinkled up carrot finger?! Trump and Sessions’ zero policy law is to blame for this—prosecuting EVERYONE coming through the border at unofficial border crossing points, as that’s now considered an act immediately worthy of criminalization, therefore, innocent people are getting detained, therefore, parents are getting taken away from their kids, therefore, innocent children are also getting detained.\n\nI get that this zero tolerance policy was created to help with the influx of illegal, potentially dangerous, immigrants, such as terrorists, but it is at the risk of destroying the lives of thousands of others who are innocent, fleeing from a civilization overtaken by all forms of injustice and corruption. \n\nSo the GOP is arguing that all of these Immigrants should have “waited in line” and gone through the INCREDIBLY LONG process of getting into the countries official border crossing stations. First of all many of these people have no idea that a process even exists, let alone that specific stations exist! They don’t have the opportunity to be caught up on all of our governments policy changes, or what’s freaking appropriate, or what the specific step by step actions are! We’re talking about people who are fleeing from a society taken over by unlawful rulers influencing the spread of misinformation, poverty, destroyed homes, killed friends and family, slavery, and murder threats. How do the GOP members expect these people, desperately seeking survival, to be up to date on how to “properly” flee from death and destruction!? \n\nEven if these asylum seeking immigrants knew our laws before fleeing, our laws are always changing and sometimes so hard to even find and understand fully. I’m a citizen who has the opportunity and privilege and resources to be informed, but it’s hard for even me to know what the hell’s going on because most of the news stories are stories of politicians’ ongoing arguments to put things into law, long spans of non-agreements, and further arguments—nothing actually happening. On the rare occasion things do happen and laws are changed, you have to go through loads of information to find reliable resources and explanations etc etc. For Gods sake give these people a damn break\n'
'Democrats already offered to pay for his stupid wall when we were going through all the DACA shit.  Trump is doing this because he wants to punish brown people, full stop.'
"I found this [quote](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/06/understanding-the-administrations-monstrous-immigration-policies) from Brianna Rennix of Current Affairs to be appalling if true. \n\n>Children are NOT being taken from their parents simply because the government wishes to prosecute their parents for illegal entry and the children cannot accompany them to jail. That makes it sound like these separations are simply incidental to a separate enforcement policy that the government decided to pursue.  \n>  \n>The reality is actually just the opposite. The Trump administration's decision to prosecute parents for illegal entry was taken *in order to create an excuse to separate mothers from children.*"
'The United States doesn’t negotiate with terrorists. By terrorist I am referring to our president.'
"100% correct. Nebraska's governor Pete Ricketts, who fully follows the Trump party line, posted this statement arguing for building the wall last night:\n\n>While there seems to be a lot of misinformation and propaganda regarding the situation on our border, one thing is clear: Children should not be separated from their families. The previous policy of catch-and-release was unacceptable because it made our border problem worse, but it does not make the expanded practice of separating children from their families humane.\n>\n>Some have rightly pointed out that some separations occur to protect children from human trafficking or other criminal activity. This is important to acknowledge, though it does not fully account for the dramatic increase in separations widely reported over the last week.\n>\n>The American people have been asking Washington to solve this problem for decades now. Having iron clad control of our borders is an increasingly urgent matter in this dangerous global climate. Let’s reform our immigration policies so the workforce we need can come here legally. Let’s build the wall, hire more border patrol agents, and crack down on the businesses that recruit and hire illegal immigrants with steep fines. And along the way, let’s ensure children do not get caught in the crossfire on American soil when it comes to Washington politics."

If he doesn’t own stock in American Steel Rebar directly, I guarantee his buddies do and they’ll get him a nice kickback when it goes through.\n\nIt’s theft of $billions of public funds using lies, deceit, demagoguery, bigotry, racism and now kidnapping.\n\nHow much more of this shit are we going to take?'

"How the fuck can we expect any country to respect us when our president is trying and blatantly failing to cover-up fucking a porn star?\n\nYou have to be a sicko to think Donald Trump is a return to class in the White House after Obama. We had a president with no affairs, no bribe allegations, and a beautiful family that genuinely seemed to love each other. Now we have this? **This** is better?\n\nI don't care if you are republican, democrat, or anything in between. Donald Trump is unfit to be president and a hell of a lot worse and more classless than Obama on his worst day."
"He didn't know about the payment yet he is suing her for failing to adhere to the contract?  He really is very stupid."
"Here are some thoughts on why this is so important...Stormy Daniels did a recent interview on 60 minutes yielding very high ratings [[1]](http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/26/media/anderson-cooper-stormy-daniels-60-minutes-ratings/index.html) where she discussed physical threats that had been made against her in the wake of her (alleged) affair with Donald Trump. Yet the most important developments this week, and which are somewhat less in the limelight, arguably come from Michael Avenatti - her lawyer- who has been extremely vocal about the case. The Stephanie Clifford case is arguably the most pressing legal danger to Donald Trump - although there are others, including the emoluments case (alleging Trump illegally accepted gifts from foreign governments through his business) which, as of a few days ago, was allowed to move forward [[2]](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/28/politics/emoluments-lawsuit-trump-hotel/index.html).\n\nAvenatti has asked the court to compel Trump to testify in a deposition [[3]](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/28/stormy-daniels-lawyer-trump-deposition-testify), which would put Trump in the precarious position of having to answer questions under oath - something that, although Trump says he is excited to do [[4]](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/24/donald-trump-russia-investigation-testimony), he has avoided as part of the Russia investigation [[5]](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/wsj-trump-lawyers-seek-to-avoid-perjury-trap-in-potential-mueller-interview). Many have speculated that Trump would be unable to control himself under oath, and may not be able to prevent himself from committing perjury [[6]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/03/27/is-trump-too-much-of-a-perjury-risk-for-potential-lawyers-that-and-other-possibilities/?utm_term=.57937cc1c541). Yet, see here: [this is a key detail from the complaint filed by Michael Avenatti on behalf of his client Stephanie Clifford](https://theweeklycentrist.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/1.jpg?w=570&h=268).\n\nAs a part of their complaint, Avenatti alleges that Michael Cohen, Trump's attorney, has violated the rules of professional conduct for attorneys in the state of New York [[7]](https://twitter.com/MichaelAvenatti/status/978638154747056133) - and he appears to be correct, given that Cohen himself has stated in the past that the payments were made using his home equity line [[8]](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/09/politics/michael-cohen-trump-organization-email-stormy-daniels/index.html).\n\nSecondly, they allege that Cohen has violated the rules of professional conduct in an additional way, because his public comments suggest that he formed the company EC LLC, which entered into the agreement with Clifford without Trump's knowledge [[9]](https://twitter.com/MichaelAvenatti/status/978638659602837504). [See here](https://www.theweeklycentrist.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/2.jpg?w=543&h=387) for the relevant section.\n\n\nThe case against the non-disclosure agreement seems solid. The formation of EC LLC by Cohen was very likely an illegal act - since the LLC was formed with the express intent of covering up adultery, a crime in New York [[10]](https://twitter.com/MichaelAvenatti/status/978638340080766978). The payments of $130,000 may also constitute violations of campaign finance law (the maximum payment for an individual to the campaign allowed by law is $2700, and the NDA - something that will be assessed as being of value to the Trump campaign - was provided to help Trump by Cohen and valued by him to be in excess of that limit).\n\nYet the most significant part of all of this may be the following: according to WSJ, Cohen had complained about not being reimbursed for his payments by Trump [[11]](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/05/politics/michael-cohen-stormy-daniels/index.html). Yet this is inconsistent with the approach Cohen and his attorney are taking in the case. Cohen's attorney argued that Trump was not aware this was taking place [[12]](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/03/michael-cohens-attorney-may-be-a-worse-lawyer-than-he-is.html). So, the argument put forth by Cohen's attorney is that Cohen alone had brokered with Clifford via the shell corporation EC LLC. They argue the agreement was between EC LLC and Clifford alone. Trump's comments today echo that sentiment. Why would they *intentionally* admit that Cohen may have broken the law? They are not denying, perhaps even admitting, that Cohen engaged in behavior that would be in violation of the New York rules of professional conduct (and perhaps the law as well, if he alone is responsible to setting up EC LLC to cover up adultery in New York state).\n\nTheir approach is not as stupid as everyone seems to think. What this seems to amount to is the following: while many are criticizing Cohen's attorney for being *worse* than him (and implicating Cohen in professional misconduct that could have ramifications for him), the move may not be without tact and purpose. While one would expect the logical move for Cohen would be to protect himself (hence the criticism of his attorney), they are doing exactly the opposite: Cohen appears to be falling on his sword to protect Trump - at the risk of perhaps being disbarred himself. He is gambling on facing disciplinary action from the bar association *in exchange for* protecting Trump from criminal liability as a result of the charges being filed by Avenatti & Daniels. The fact that Trump is confirming this story line today (despite the fact that we know Cohen likely *was* reimbursed for his payments, or at least expected himself to be) suggests that this is their *agreed upon tactic* (i.e. They are lying, and Trump *is well aware of that* -  so he is attempting, again, to cover up a crime).\n\nIf they continue down this path in the next few days, it will be extremely telling - and one will have to ask, what has Trump offered Cohen in exchange that is worth more than his license to practice law? "
"Isn't this like one of **only** two lawyers he has left? Throwing either one of them under the bus is such an insanely ignorant decision. This will leave him even more vulnerable and susceptible to everything else including the sheer madness of his own ego."
'The problem is that Cohen indicated to Daniels and her attorney that he represented Trump in this matter.  That is fraud.  Cohen is fucked big time.'
'So let me get this straight.\n\nStormy Daniels invents a fictitious affair with Donald Trump in 2011.  In 2016, she secretly approaches Michael Cohen (not Trump) and demands a payment for her silence on her false claims.  Michael Cohen then drafts a contract that is legally binding on Donald, and mortgages his house (!) in order to pay off this fraudster.  *And never mentions a word of this to Donald*.\n\nGet the fuck out of town.\n'
'Trump just fucked Michael Cohen so hard that he needed Michael Cohen to pay Michael Cohen $130,000 to keep it quiet.'
"Newsflash!\nNumber of Trump's proven lies is approaching 2500 since he took office.  This is over 5 lies per day.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/01/10/president-trump-has-made-more-than-2000-false-or-misleading-claims-over-355-days"
'This idiot has no idea how to say "no comment" does he?'
"So... Either Trump A) knowingly used campaign money to pay off a porn star he slept with... or B) he's so incompetent that he completely missed his lawyer using campaign funds to pay a six-figure sum of hush money to said porn star.\n\nAm I missing a third option here?"

It is a political, ideological move driven by the language of the campaign and, frankly, campaign promises - promises in the campaign that were hyped (ph) by an exaggeration of the threat.

'To be fair, the president of Puerto Rico is a totally incompetent tool and a complete douchebag, so there’s that. '
'There\'s not one damn thing in the article to support the headline. According to the article, FEMA is helping the people to the extent it can. The countryside was totally destroyed. That can\'t be fixed overnight. \n\nNot one nurse said "The Trump Administration is letting Americans die..." No one else said that. The headline is a total lie. Whoever wrote is should be fired. More fake news  from Newsweek. '

"I'm from Bayamon, Puerto Rico, currently living in NY. Our whole family is still on the island. Last week my mother-in-law passed away from lack of hospital resources. I'm a physician and the details are still murky, even after talking to the doctor who cared for her, but it sounds like she developed a lung infection, and then this infection spread to her bloodstream (which is called sepsis, and it's very bad). She was taken to a hospital, but their ICU wasn't functioning from lack of power, space and supplies. She required medications to keep her blood pressure elevated and a ventilator to breathe for her. She lasted the night and passed away Wed morning. She was in Bayamon, which is one of the more populated municipalities. I'm sure similar scenarios are playing out throughout the island, in areas even more affected than my hometown (ie, more rural and poorer municipalities). I have no words to describe our frustration with the situation in general, but especially with the slow response in the aftermath.  All I can do from far away is gather money and supplies to send to the island and watch them be squandered, lost or stay stuck in the ports. We need first responders, cleaning crews and people to make way to these more affected regions. It's been nice seeing the response from individuals throughout the nation, but the government's response has been beyond infuriating. The orange fool has reached new lows in my book."
'Got put in FB jail for telling someone on CNN they were a sociopath after they said they hoped most of em die and the rest need to pay back Trump and the US... what the hell is going on Fox News?'
"Puerto Ricans don't pay federal income tax. They pay a large local tax. They should be blaming their local politicians for failing them. Driving them into inescapable debt.\n\n Imagine the response from the left if texas didn't pay federal tax and needed federal assistance after hurricane harvey."
'This isn\'t a concern for Trump, and he\'s not going to be guilted into doing the right thing for little people he has no common ground with. The more headlines that plead for him to help out of some sense of common decency, the more he will just go play golf and pretend there\'s not a problem.\n\n\nTo get his attention, the news headlines need to be formatted to say something like the following:\n\n* "Putin is alarmed by the devastation in Puerto Rico, which is an American Island"\n\n* "Trump supporters in Michigan claim they will not attend next Trump rally unless hurricane damage in Puerto Rico is cleaned up"\n\n* "Sources say that Ivanka feels bad for Puerto Rico and wishes there was some way she could help those poor people"\n\n* "Leading Democrats say we should just let Puerto Rico die so Trump supporters can\'t organize a MAGA rally there in November"\n\n* "North Korean Leader claims Puerto Rico as their territory, says Trump is a whiny bitch and doesn\'t deserve to call it an American Property. Threatens nuclear strike against mainland"\n\n\nAny of these would probably cause Trump to send overwhelming support to the island once Fox News mentions them.'
"Man, these comments are surprisingly Pro Trump.  \n\nI don't fucking care who you voted for or who you supported.  These are Americans who are being left out in the wild to die.  5 bottles of water a week?  Seriously?  We could, and should, be doing a whole hell of a lot more.  I'm sure the property damage in Houston is terrible.  I know someone who lost 2 houses and a few cars.  But the man is fed, has water, and isn't going to die in the next month from malnutrition.  \n\nThis country is completely fucked in the head right now."
"My uncle volunteered to go to PR as a firefighter, to aid with clean up and search and rescue and stuff. He was able to get to my his aunt's house, where a bunch of other aunts and uncles and cousins were living because their own homes were destroyed. When he got there they had been crying because they ran out of food. This is 6+ people living in one home, no food, no water. No one had come to help them. I am so fucking disgusted that this is how things are going, and my heart hurts for my family and all other people living there. I can't imagine. "

Read what they read. They can\'t directly kill the people, but they want the population of the planet to go way down. Their strategy is to let them die. That\'s why they\u200b deny climate change. They believe the science, they know it\'s correct, but they aren\'t in it to save the planet or the people. It\'s right there and they talk about it all day long, in not too coded vocabulary, either.

"Puerto rican here, I lost everything too. It boggles my mind how they are trying to pin this on Trump or the federal government. None of our live here, you don't know our politics and how insanely corrupt our government and politicians are. We have  known since ever the only part of the island that is always well maintained is the metropolitan north area. All these deaths, all this chaos and bad handling is the effect of the decades of neglect the government has had for the rest of Puerto Rico. Entire shipments of supplies and help are being stolen from the ports. I don't know how to make you guys understand... the help is here, it's our inept corrupt government who is grossly mismanaging everything. To the point that people are asking for ways to get the help here in some way that the government can't touch it. Some people are even asking for the military to just take over everything.\n\nThis is what happens when you have decades of politicians who steal the public's money to fill their wallets and not take care of the roads, dams, infrastructure or at least some money to help their own people. What we need is a cleansing of these vile officials. "

I really think this entire situation, just with any natural disaster is people don't have the capacity to give a shit if it's not directly affecting them. Send your thoughts and prayers and give the victims of Puerto rico a like and get angry at trump for being a direct representation of how the country feels when it comes to helping or responding in a timely manner to natural disasters.

Not everyone was that was there was a nazi and in fact it was probably an extreme minority.

Not only is he extremely supportive of Israel, more than Obama ever was, he is one of only two presidents to have a rabbi pray at his inauguration. Trump has been supportive of Jewish people since before the election so this side is not for show. \n\nIf anyone here thinks that it is appropriate to label people of dissenting opinions Nazis without a shred of actual evidence, they are childish and should be ashamed for doing so. By making out people like Trump and his supporters as Nazis you are degrading the crimes of actual Nazis. You are marginalizing their victims and degrading our stances against actual Nazism.

But it doesn\'t exist because the claims are false. \n\n“Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups,” Trump said. \n\nPoint out to me what part of that statement is sympathizing with Nazis. \n\nIm not claiming Trump hasn\'t made factual errors and or missteps in addressing the Charlottesville Event, but that doesn\'t warrant him being called a Nazi Sympathizer. Calling out Anti-fa as an alt left violent movement was necessary because they have been and continue to be violent. They have assaulted journalists and police, destroyed property,  shut down conservative events, and promote violence against anyone that disagrees with their ideology. Trump condemning anti-fa doesn\'t make him a supporter of nazis, it means he has some semblance of the reality of the situation, albeit a biased one. \n'

Has anyone seen the reports coming out this week that show the DNC emails were leaked from the inside and not the hacked from the outside?? Calling the President a Nazi sympathizer is the lefts last attempt at discrediting his election. Are you saying everyone who voted for him is a fucking Nazi sympathizer?? Once you start calling people Nazis you look foolish. The kid with the car attack was a terrorist and we ALL hate him. These skin heads who have hijacked the right wing message are a tiny percent who are only interested in spreading fear and hate. 99 percent of people in this world are good people. How ironic it is that left is now blaming the actions of a few on the whole group.. Shame"
"This article is crazy.  I'm no fan of Trump, I think he's a boor and a blow hard, but this article is waaaaay out in left field.  It's going to have zero impact outside the echo chamber.  So bad I can barely believe it.  C'mon reddit people,  there are tons of legit reasons to attack him, and personally I find myself wanting to avoid being part of the group making nutty accusations about Trump like this."
'It\'s really insane how a few months ago, I would\'ve read this headline and though "that\'s some bullshit alarmism." Nope, this is just a report'
"I think everyone complimenting this article is flat out acting purposely ignorant. I do not say this to be mean, but to accurately use the term ignorant. He has openly condemned white supremacy and Nazis. \n\nHere is a CNN article about it (reminder: CNN has literally been caught making stuff up about Trump and ever they published that he condemned them): http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/14/politics/trump-condemns-charlottesville-attackers/index.html\n\nAnd there WAS violence on BOTH SIDES that weekend in the park. Acting like there wasn't is just lying to yourself. Heck, the biggest picture from that day is a right person fighting a left person who is using a make shift flame thrower. Just because the only civilian death that weekend was a left wing marcher, it doesn't mean both sides don't share apart of the blame for the shit show that was that weekend.\n\nAnd guess what? Not everyone protesting WAS a white supremacist. Some were literally just there to protest the taking down of the statue, so he was 100% correct in saying what he did. The fact that so many are praising this easily-proven-wrong article is scary for me. And it being the #1 post on my home feed is frankly, dumb.\n\nPS, I'm not republican, I actually am 3rd party / unaffiliated and I did NOT vote for Trump and generally dislike him."
"> The late U.S. Poet Laureate Dr. Maya Angelou once said, “When someone shows you who they are, believe them!”\n\n> In other words, no one can hide his true nature. Never has this been more accurate for an American president than in the case of Donald Trump.\n\nThe author damages their own article by beginning with a sloppy platitude. This has nothing to do with people trying to hide their natures, it has to do with being able to assess people by what they do naturally.\n\nFor instance, in the same article a disparity is noted between what Trump says when forced to follow a script, and what he says extemporaneously, i.e. that he can condemn racists when he's reading page of someone else's words that he's been convinced he needs to say, but he can't bring himself to do it when he has to create the idea in his own mind and express it.\n\nThat is what makes the point. This is a person who sympathizes with racists, knows that racists support him, welcomes that, and in fact represents them. Words he reads off pieces of paper don't matter."
"> How, Chief of Staff John Kelly, can the parents of two African-American 82nd Airborne paratroopers killed in Iraq the day after the carnage in Charlottesville be assured that the deaths of their sons mean as much to the president **as the tragic and heroic death of your own son in combat** — when Trump defiantly and repeatedly equates white supremacists with those brave enough to confront their vile hatred?\n\nOkay, I'm all about bashing the Trump administration.  But calling out this guy's dead son??? That's a serious low-blow.  Bad form. "

This should be the attitude for every president, sure biases will show but in the end it's because of the extremely powerful position the president holds is the reason for this intense criticism whenever he makes even a tiny fuck up. \n\nIt's The exact same situation you would put a doctor in when performing an operation. If he accidentally nicks a vessel or forgets a sponge inside the cavity, he gets crucified because the ramifications are so enormous. And personally, I think I'm being very generous with that analogy because the president is in charge of a lot more lives than a doctor would be over his entire career. \n\nI just don't understand why this is so hard for so many to grasp.

"It's crazier than that. He accused Obama's **FBI** of having an informant in the Trump campaign. For most organisations pointing out that you had an FBI informant in your ranks would be hugely embarrassing because in a normal timeline that would be seen as evidence that your organisation was involved in some sort of criminal activity.\n\nBut for Trump and his sycophants they try to completely turn it on its head and claim that having an informant inside Trump's campaign is proof that the FBI is corrupt. There is **no** logic to that whatsoever. Literally none at all. It's fucking ridiculous that this is actually seen as a legitimate line of thinking because it is completely and utterly illogical."
'He seems really angry at Dems for losing the election!'
"Anyone else feel like Trump is starting to feel cornered and is lashing out? It's so obvious he's reaching for any distraction.  FFS, Obama?!  I'm surprised Hillary wasn't mentioned in this conspiracy theory."
'Next: "Obama forced me to launder money and cheat on Melania!"'
"If a FBI agent was planted in the campaign to collect criminal evidence that's not a good thing for you. He must know it was going to come out eventually and wanted to tell his base how to feel first."
'"There’s probably no doubt..."\n\nWhat the fuck level of bullshit uncertain certainty is that? There\'s probably no doubt that I\'m the Lord and savior Jesus Christ.'
'Can we please get rid of this lying idiot, America? Please? When is the right time? How many lies and how much cruelty will it take?'
'The NYT destroyed this yesterday with an article proving that there was nothing done to trump during his campaign.  \n\nDon\'t let Trump distract us from the fact that he illegally paid Michael Cohen, and also called all Mexicans "animals."  \n\nHe\'s losing it, hard and fast.  '
'If the FBI got an informant in the Trump campaign because they knew it was trying to collude with Russia then that is not Obama embedding a fucking spy. The sad thing is his idiot supporters will believe this 100% cause they have no fucking clue how the govt works and believe their racist cult leader no matter what. Fuck the US'
"I kind of think Obama needs to start clapping back. I know he's too stoic to do that, but it might actually help purge this nonsense quicker.\n\nCan you imagine the rage tweets that Trump would fire off on the shitter if Obama started counterpunching? Because we all know that O's would be sharper."
'I wish this stupid chucklehead would have a heart attack on the bowl and get the hell out of our lives.'
'Still blaming Obama? How pathetic is the draft dodging dorito!?'
'>"If so, this is bigger than Watergate!"\n\nSo true, so true!\n\nOh, you meant like Obama is Nixon...yeah, no.  It is bigger than Watergate in the sense that you were doing something so wrong that one of your staffers turned into an FBI confidential informant because it concerned them so much.  It is directly comparable to Watergate in that you used illegal means to hamper the campaign of your opponent and then have worked to cover it up.\n\nIn fact, maybe you should stop bringing up Watergate.  Every time you do, it just reminds people of how similar your situation is to Nixon\'s.  You are Nixon and not McGovern in this scenario.'
"Dude is forever waffling on about Democratic scandals being 'bigger than Watergate'.  \n\nJust more predictable, tiring projection from our lying President. "
'Totally just Trump saying this... Just ignore the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post that broke the news. Fake news!'
'When you drunk tweet your ex and accuse them of cheating almost a year after you broke up'
"Sorry Trumplestiltskin, Obama was busy running the country and doing good things to be worried about your sorry ass.  He doesn't sit on the toilet all day with Fox on in the bathroom tv waiting for poop to fall out while spouting nonsense on Twitter."
">[...a confidential informant is someone who came to the police voluntarily and doesn't wish to be identified, often because of a fear of retaliation.](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/learning-the-identity-confidential-informant.html)\n\nCI =/= FBI plant. "
'So what he’s saying is someone in his campaign realized they were committing treason and crimes and didn’t want to go to jail or betray their country so they became an informant?\n\nI mean doesn’t this just AGAIN look bad on Trump?\n\nIt’s not illegal to be a confidential informant. '
'This fucker is mentally ill.'
"His tweets are just... Sad. Sad and pathetic. These are the ravings of a lunatic. This is like when Anderson Cooper described Trump's unhinged Fox interview as reminiscent of an old man yelling from a park bench."
'Donald Trump is a terrible person and I am still very ashamed of my country.'
"So the treachery of Trump's campaign is Obama's fault, not Trump's fault. Ok. /s"
'"Old man yells online at black man he irrationally blames for all his problems."\n\nThis really just sounds like your angry grandpa ranting into the void of the internet and really wouldn\'t be news if this old man weren\'t president. '

'Damn right you traitor piece of shit. '
"And the worst part about it is that for some reason, R's and Trump will kick and scream about democrats doing it... Like somehow him calling it now makes it unwarranted against him or something."
"A guy who can't be bothered with a plan to increase GDP to 4% who instead starts a tariff war which leads to depression. who Oks yet another Republican tax cut for the rich  which leads to recession, who is pretending that science doesn't exist and who refuses to deal with the environment, and caused the worst blackout in history  now wants to predict that he'll be impeached.\n\nGo figure.\n\n"
"here's where we're going to start seeing real campaign fraud rear its ugly head.   it's going to be bold. it's going to be obvious.  it's going to be Trumpian."
'Here that Dems? Isn\'t that motivating?\n\nHe should add "and prosecute me for treason and send my sorry fat ass to jail" to really stir up the Democratic base.'
'What a hell of a trip for R’s this entire pile of midterm nonsense must be. I can’t imagine what their private thoughts must be like these days. Like, what other conclusion can any of them draw from this turn of events besides the realization that their *own base* dislike them enough that they have no choice but to lick the boots of a batty old fuckhead with absolutely no redeeming professional qualities beyond his ability to rubber stamp any policy proposal R’s put in front of them. Even if they don’t see it in exactly that same way, they’re still left with the obvious message that they are *less capable of getting votes on the merits of their own beings and messages than fucking Donald Trump*.\n\nHe truly is the tide that lowers all boats.\n\nWhy anyone would ever voluntarily work with, near, or even simply under the banner of someone so poisonous to both the careers and lives of all those associated with him is a mystery to me.'
'Is that supposed to keep people from voting for Democrats?\n\nYou’re a corrupt asshole moron who watches TV all day and lives in government housing. All of America hates you. \n\nFucking goodbye. '
"Jesus Christ, Nancy, grow some balls or shut your trap. We're tired of these political games, tired of weak Democrats. We're tired of politicians who don't stand for anything but their careers. Impeach that disgraceful son of a bitch. "
'Why would you be impeached, Mr. Trump? Is it because you have done illegal things? '
"Uh, yea. It's because you are a shit show not due to prosecutors being over zealous. How many Presidents made the whole eight years without impeachment issues (real ones)? Yea... it's because everyone is against you not because you are ethically bankrupt. An old saying, if everyone you meet is an asshole. You are the asshole."
'Damn deep state, threatening to impeach over impeachable offenses.'
'In 2016: we need the Supreme Court so fuck Merrik! In 2018: I need the oval office so fuck the democrats!'
'Voting against this fuckhead in the mid-terms is going to feel *so good.*'

'> "Anti-aircraft Guns – While these weapons were designed to take down enemy fighter jets, they have become a favorite method of execution for Kim. In 2015, reports surfaced from South Korean intelligence that the dictator’s Defense Minister Hyong Yong Chol was pulverized to death by an anti-aircraft gun after the young despot ordered his execution for falling asleep during an event and not carrying out instructions.\n\n> Hee Yeon Lim, a 26-year-old defector, recently told western media that she was part of a crowd of 10,000 ordered to watch the execution by anti-aircraft guns of 11 musicians who allegedly made a pornographic video. \n\n> “What I saw that day made me sick in my stomach. They were lashed to the end of anti-aircraft guns,” she said. “A gun was fired, the noise was deafening, absolutely terrifying. And the guns were fired one after the other.”\n\n> She added: “The musicians just disappeared each time the guns were fired into them. Their bodies were blown to bits, totally destroyed, blood and bits flying everywhere…and then, after that, military tanks moved in and they ran over the bits on the ground where the remains lay."\n\nNo shit they stand up Donny.

"First, the man doesn't condemn Nazis.  Then, he doesn't respond with empathy or support when millions of Americans are devastated by a natural disaster.  Now, Trump can't even get honoring fallen troops right.  All of the above are **soft balls**.  They've been placed gently on a tee, he's has been given an over-sized wiffle ball bat, and no matter how hard he tries Donnie just can't seem to hit the damn balls!  What's going to happen when someone fires a fastball at him going 100 mph?  It's not going to go well, for him or the country."
"Of course he lied about this. If you lie about donating to charities, nothing is too low for you. I also read that in the conversation that Trump had where he said the fallen soldier had known what he was getting into, he didn't even know the fallen solder's name. To me, that's *much more* heinous than anything else. \n\nNot a peep on news or worldnews, despite there being a Top 10 BBC trending article about this. Same thing happened with the Eminem performance. There is no spinning this. "
'Trump opened this rabbithole by making his insane quip about Obama not calling the families of fallen soliders so, he deserves any criticism he gets for how he has acted towards the same families.'
' Trump is a fraud,he tries to wrap himself in the flag over the NFL,While treating having to offer condolences to the families of the Fallen as a distastful job he is forced to do. Trump is a disgrace. To all the families of the Fallen present and past we the people offer our deepest sympathies and our unending respect.'
"Drudge headline:\n\n**TRUMP GOES TO WAR OVER WIDOW PHONE CALL**\n\nThink about that for a minute. Trump, the PRESIDENT, is so callous, thin-skinned, and heartless that he can't even be contrite and humble in the face of a grieving family of a recently slain U.S. soldier.\n\nHe is making political theater and mockery out of their grief to stoke his own fragile ego. He is playing football with the body of a dead U.S. soldier.\n\nJust.... Seriously think about that for a minute. \n"
'Don\'t blame Trump for not contacting these military families, he\'s got lots of golfing to do and he needs to tweet out constant bullshit to keep his flock brainwashed.  It\'s a lot of work to be such a terrible "president"'
'Is it me or this this just misleading journalism? The second paragraph they say “However, Eddie and Aldene Lee told the outlet they heard from Trump 10 days after their son was killed in Iraq, saying it was beautiful to hear Trump describe their son as "lovely."\n\nI’m no supporter but the premise if the article signaled by the title is he didn’t call anyone isn’t it? Am I missing something?'
"I realize it's easy/fun to use these stories to shit on Trump. And generally I am all about shitting on Trump.\n\nBut it's also worth noting that it's fucking tragic that these families have become a political football at literally the worst moment in their lives. Maybe we should let *them* decide when/where/how to make a political issue of this...if at all?\n\nEDIT: I realize that nuance is hard on r/politics, but I'm not saying we should let Trump off the hook and I'm certainly not defending him. I'm just saying that on this issue, let's weigh how what we say--and how we say it--might affect Trump's victims. If we are willing to let these families suffer in the name of scoring political points, we aren't really any better than the person we're opposing."
"Much like a lot of the outrage towards Trump, the problem here is not what he did. It is his blatant hypocrisy. It often is just a political move to call the families of soldiers and the reality of war is that hundreds are killed so it is understandable that the president is too busy to call every family to speak with them. It's not ideal but reasonable people could understand it. But when he criticizes other presidents for not calling families, and then do that exact thing, there is the problem. The list of examples of this goes on and on: Trump saying Clinton is a rapist, Trump criticizing Hillary's private server, spending time golfing, and so on. "
'If my son died in combat, I would not want to hear from this fuck.  '
"It seems pretty clear that Trump is used to being able to say whatever he wants inside his companies and either no one dares challenge what he says or no one has access to any proof to dispute.\n\nWhat's shocking is that he would still be under the impression he can get away with that same behavior in the very public office of the PoTUS.\n\nI guess stupid is as stupid does."
'Legit question: What is Pres. Trumps record for calling families of black KIA and white KIA?'
"Five'll get you ten that Trump's staff filters back the people he actually calls only to people that align with him politically so he doesn't get his ego hurt and attack another gold star family on twitter. "

'Soooo Donald trump is doing something that the republicans claim they unanimously despise (disrespecting troops) and I havent heard a single republican denounce him for it. Is it because they are completely and utterly ignorant or is it because they never had any principles to begin with?'
"Trump is not full of empathy.  Listen to his speeches after a tragedy.  There is no human emotional connection.  He's reading from a piece of paper wondering if there will be KFC when he's done.  What is going on here that is surprising to anybody.  He's an incompetent manboy.  That's all.  Maybe damaged because of poor parenting or natively a bit socio.  Who cares really, the damage is done."

'this week conservatives were bending over backwards to condemn anyone who took a photo with Harvey, but they voted/supported an equally terrible in trump.\n\nif this story gets picked up outside of buzzfeed, lets see how they react\n'
"I hope this is the first of many. There have been so many allegations over the years of sexual assault and even underage rape by Trump, and it all needs to be given full exposure. \n\nHere's just one, but it's one of the worst:\n\n[Video testimony from Katie J, who accuses Trump of raping her at 13 after she was hired by Jeffrey Epstein to work his sex parties.](https://twitter.com/BanditRandom/status/894799540485619712)\n\nAnd her affidavit, consistent with her testimony:\n\nhttps://www.scribd.com/doc/316341058/Donald-Trump-Jeffrey-Epstein-Rape-Lawsuit-and-Affidavits\n\n>and knew that Plaintiff was then just 13 years old. Exhs. A and B.10.\n\n>Defendant Trump initiated sexual contact with Plaintiff at four different parties.On the fourth and final sexual encounter with Defendant Trump, Defendant Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff. During the course of this savage sexual attack, Plaintiff loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but with no effect. Defendant Trump responded to Plaintiff’s pleas by violently striking Plaintiff in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted."
'So weinstein gets a load of women accusing him of groping and sexual intimidation, he loses everything, gets kicked put everywhere\n\nTrump gets the same thing, including the allegation that he raped a 13 yo, and.. Well, he is still president '
"Sick fucks. Republicans believe all sexual assault accusers only if they're doing it to someone they don't like. "
"Great. The more he's pinned down dealing with this kind of shit, the less he can screw us up otherwise."
'Man, how pissed is he gonna be if he is impeached because of a precadent set by Republicans impeaching Clinton?'
"He's a rapist "
'It is time to impeach this man. Republicans in Congress who still refuse to remove him are exposing themselves to treason. \n\nHonestly, how can any Republican justify having a serial sexual abuser in office?'
"I'm disgusted as always. Too many criminals in power."
"Wouldn't be the epitome of irony if he is eventually impeached for lying to the courts about sexual misconduct? Between the emails, deflection with the insinuation of a potential war among the mirade of countless other scandals, this would be the icing on the cake. Not even George R. R. Martin could write a better story."
"This is why Donald Trump is so set I'm calling the media fake news so relentlessly, so he can coach his supporters into believing that any new revelation is fake and biased against him.\n\nWe have underestimated the power of this con man."
'Look at Jacob Zuma the president of South Africa, he has so many rape accusations and nothing gets done because he has power over everything in this country'
'Let me guess, r/the Donald is fuming with comments like “who’d want to fuck her?”.'
'Poor Harvey its only ok to sexual assault if you are a presidential candidate and or President. '
'If everything that has been coming out about Trump in the last year is true I want to see him crucified. Listening to him speak makes all the stuff even more believable. Each story that comes out I think (for some stupid reason) there is no way he could be stupid enough to say that and sure enough he is.\n\nI want to see him and his family lose everything, every single cent. I want to see him rot in jail and then die a long drawn out painful death. \n\nPrior to this election cycle I knew he was scum but since that all the news that comes out on him makes me hate him more than any other human being alive.\n\nThe worst part is even if everything coming out was proven to be 100% true with out a doubt he would still have supporters. '
"Oh look, another thing that would probably bring down a normal politician. But somehow Trump will survive. \n\nIt's like that bit with Mr Burns. You know where he has every illness so somehow they are all having no effect. \n\nTrump has so many scandals that they all stop each other from having any effect. "
"I don't know what's more sad, that we are still fighting a war against sexual assault, or that those committing flagrant assault are still protected by their sheer political power."
'Considering that this is Donald Trump we’re talking about here, I doubt he’s going to be found guilty of anything. As he himself said, he could shoot someone and not lose voters.'
"I'm kind of worried about what this case could mean if they allow it to go forward. I mean, hopefully the next president won't be as scandalous as Trump, but this could leave a door open for people hoping to attack any president in office.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the fucker's guilty as hell, and he should be punished for it. But we are in a jam here, now that he's able to hide behind a White House desk."
'Does this mean Trump is finally going to pay for his crimes? Oh god I hope so. Jail this piece of shit for the rest of his life. He might as well be convicted of murder considering he sentences thousands of poor people to die with his recent executive order '
'Why would there be any papers? In all my never having assaulted anyone ever, I have always thought that documenting even most hypothetical assault, would be a stupid move. This proves that Trumfus is not fit to be president.'

'> A lawsuit filed by D.C. and Maryland against President Trump over his alleged business conflicts has been expanded to include Trump in his personal capacity as a businessman, which means that\xa0a summons has been sent to perhaps the most famous address in Washington: 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\n> The attorneys general for both states argue in a lawsuit that Trump is violating the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, which in part bans public officials from receiving gifts and payments from foreign governments without approval from Congress.\n\n> They argue that Trump’s refusal to divest from his sprawling business empire\xa0—\xa0in particular, the Trump International Hotel in downtown D.C. — has meant that foreign governments have directly paid the Trump Organization for hotel bookings and events.\n\n>The suit also alleges that businesses in both Maryland and D.C. have lost out on potential profits because groups are staying at Trump’s properties in order to curry favor with the president.\n\n> A similar emoluments lawsuit brought by an ethics watchdog and a restaurant group was tossed out earlier this year after a judge said the plaintiffs didn’t have standing. In dismissing that suit, the judge questioned whether it would be better for Congress to decide this emoluments issue rather than the courts.\n\n> But some legal experts say the Maryland and D.C. lawsuit may have a better chance of moving forward.\n\n> The move to name Trump as a personal defendant in the suit follows the suggestion of the federal judge in the case.\nTrump’s lawyers have three weeks to respond.'
'We are definitely in the second phase of the Trump era.  The legal blitzkrieg. Mueller is getting damn close to his end game and Trump and allies are in full panic mode. Emoluments, numerous sexual scandals, defamation lawsuit and an NDA dispute. \n\nImportant note: chatter on bot activity and disinformation is increasing. Downvote obvious trolls. Don’t fall for their redirects about Clinton / Obama to move the conversation away from the corruption RIGHT NOW!! '
'This is definitely the easiest crime to prove. You don’t need access to classified documents or a law degree to prove he’s guilty as fuck on this one.'
"I'm currently in the middle of a lawsuit, and I am having a hard time doing my job because of the stress.  And I'm the one bringing the lawsuit!  So I cannot imagine that with all the lawsuits Trump has to deal with that he has any mental capacity (stable genius or not) to actually run the country.  He's dangerous because of his stupidity."
'The energy behind objections to all of the Trump scandals is cumulative. If it becomes intense enough (unlikely before the 2018 elections) it will be decided by a political decision (impeachment) rather than a legal decision by a court. The legal pretext is secondary and could come from any of the scandals since they all involve lies. The Nixon precedent has me betting on obstruction of Justice.'

"The Republican mayor of El Paso was just on NPR, saying that there really is no immigration problem in his region. He cited the 10-year plus decline in illegal immigration from Mexico, and stressed that the trade relationship between Mexico and the US is a vital part of his city's economy and culture. The Mayor isn't convinced that El Paso has any need of military assistance from the National Guard.\n\nThis is a Republican saying this. "
'I always thought the reason Donald Trump got elected was every idea he put forward was a stupid persons idea on how to fix the problem. '
'Trump and his supporters live in another reality when it comes to the issue of illegal immigration.\n\nIllegal immigration has been declining for years\n\nIllegal immigrants pay taxes but generally don’t have access to welfare so no they are not sucking the nation dry\n\nMost illegal immigrants come in via plane and overstay their visa so a southern border wall is useless. Unless your problem isn’t with illegal immigration overall but with illegal south and Central American immigrants which seems less about upholding law and order and more about you not liking brown Spainish speaking immigrants.\n\nIllegal immigrants have very little to do with job loss compared to things like automation and exporting jobs. And the first issue there we hear basically nothing about from Trump. I’ve literally never heard him complain about automation or offered a solution to automation.\n\nSo knowing all that now is it really a surprise that democrats are fighting Trump so hard on his specific polices on this issue? He’s got it all ass backwards, it’s blatent scapegoating and racist dog whistling, the wall is a taxpayer funded monument to his ego with no practical effect, and his primary focus is solving an issue that’s been resolving itself for yeeears now.

You're right though lets dwell on where he was bc he was so insufficient bc he hates the swamp and could'nt do his job anywhere unlike the last 8 years where he traveled all the time and still got jack shit done except blunderous obama care and doubled our national debts lost our jobs gave us the lowest GDP since the depression.

"Remember that wherever he goes, an enormous entourage of Secret Service and general security apparatus follows.  Presidential trips are very expensive.  And when he directs those trips toward his own properties, he is funneling all of that money directly into his own pocket.  He had blown through the Secret Service's overtime caps for over 1100 agents by August.\n\nI have no doubt the motherfucker is price gouging for these trips, too.\n\nThe Republicans are, of course, totally fine with this, even as they propagated and embraced the outrageous lie in 2010 that Obama's state visit to Mumbai was costing taxpayers $200 million per day."

Trump will have taken off millions of years of life if he’s left to his devices over the next few years and I thought he’d be better than Clinton - nope, turns out the guy is an idiot trust fund kid) and is ruining military deals that were guided as trade agreements because “it’s not profitable.” Who fucking cares if it’s profitable? It’s for superiority. So, so obviously. His tax bill is going to impoverish hundreds of millions (get the fuck out of here with your more bonus talk - if this is your point then you criminally don’t understand the problem) instead. His stupid supporters all hate trust fund kids, yet Trump and Kushner are the biggest ones out there. The stupidity is absurd and objective. \n\nHe has failed his job. Pass it along to Pence. He’s also a fucking idiot trust fund kid, but not like Trump is.\n\nHow is his cabinet not filled yet? That’s embarrassing on a global level. First ever. People are turning him down because he’s literally a moron.'

'>Faced with the unpopularity of tax cuts that are enormously regressive, the Republicans’ strategy is simple: pretend they’re not. With the help of some alternative math, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declared that the average American family “would get a $4,000 raise” under Trump’s proposal. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said the proposal is about helping families who live paycheck to paycheck. Trump himself has called his plan a “middle-class bill.”\n\n>None of these things is remotely true. In fact, if the tax cuts are paid for via the spending cuts Trump has already proposed, the Tax Policy Center estimates that 94% of Americans would lose money as a result.'
'It\'s the "fire-hose of falsehoods" Russian propaganda model. It operates under the simple principle that it takes less *time* to make a falsehood than it takes to disprove one. Thus, it creates both time and space to maneuver in.\n\nWhen an event happens that you need to propagate misinformation about, you start by creating as many false narratives as you can. One spokesperson will lie one way, another a different way. The audience will start to latch on to whichever lie "rings most true" to them. Some will believe one lie, some another, based on their own personal [Confirmation Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias). They\'ll cherry-pick the story they want to believe, good or bad. There are many many lies to choose from, and so many different members of the audience. Thus, each lie has to be disprove individually, which takes *time.* And, it takes less time to make a falsehood than it takes to disprove one.\n\nAs people scramble to disprove the falsehoods, you keep spinning more, buying yourself more time with each lie. More *time* means ever expanding *space* for you to maneuver in. By creating this extra time and space, you can wait until the next event you need to lie about happens. And, when it does, the audience moves WITH YOU to it, leaving the fact checkers behind at the last one. \n\nThe fact checkers find themselves drowning in an ever expanding hourglass, barred under the sand of your bullshit. They can\'t keep up as you make more and more **time and space** for them to become lost in.'
"The fuel for these bastards is liberal tears. They truly don't care as long as the liberals hate it."
"They've made it more difficult for *anyone* seeking to know and understand actual facts.  Right now there's so much conflicting information out there about things like 1) the Uranium One deal and 2) the Steele dossier -- where what available facts are presented are completely source-dependent -- trying to understand reality is exhausting and perhaps impossible."
'Anyone who is not a member of the 1% who voted for Trump thinking his tax cuts stood for them is a damn fool and got the fool they deserved.'
"Maybe if their entire agenda wasn't based off of fucking anyone who isn't rich and white they wouldn't have to be such lying liars to sell it."
'It is disconcerting realizing how large a segment of the population is insulated inside a bubble of lies and deception, due to the GOP and a number of "conservative" news networks. \n\nIt is one thing to present a skewed reality due to biased reporting, but claiming facts are lies to attempt duping the masses is a whole new level of degeneracy. \n\n'
"So what's going to happen once the ~~FBI~~ DoJ starts issuing indictments?  Will they call this fake news, too?  How are they going to react to it?"
'There *are* fake things, and true things misrepresented or twisted, but there is no blanket fake conspiracy. The idea of Fake News is more dangerous than whatever fake news that might actually be. The idea of fake news enables people to disqualify any fact that challenge their view/understanding. Without a challenge to meanings/opinions/views nobody is going to move forward.'
'This is what happens as you normalize gaslighting and abuse. \n\nThis is what people have been saying about cops for generations, when you let the bad apples run the show, the entire barrel rots. '
"One of the more irritating things about the media coverage of Trump and the current GOP is that this is somehow brand new behavior or strategy. I don't know what Republicans they've been paying attention to for say the last 20+ plus years, but this is S.O.P. and like page 1 from the GOP handbook the last 2 decades or more.\n\nTrump is just too stupid and impulsive to disguise the message or sell the lie so it seems worse or somehow crueller. IT IS NOT. They have been a regressive, racist, anti-woman, anti-lgbt, anti-poor, pro business, war mongering shit show of a party since at least Gingrich.\n\nThere has long been a structural rot of morals and decency and humanity at the heart of Republican politics. Trump and his supporters are mearly the latest and perhaps most dangerous symptom of this."
'I officially got the "who cares if he committed treason, we need to fix our country" excuse from a close family member today. It\'s so depressing and disheartening seeing 20 years of Fox News completely brainwash otherwise normal people. They\'ve completely compromised their morals. '
"They're going hard at it today.  They all know the Uranium One story is bullshit and that their timeline doesn't make sense but they're all talking about it anyway.  They don't have anything else to do, the only time they can get their shit together is when they're bashing Hillary or Obama."
'Republicanism isn\'t conservatism, yet they have a stranglehold on who is and isn\'t considered a true conservative.  For instance, admitting climate change is happening right now at an alarming rate and we absolutely are the driver of it, just saying that these days is enough to be labeled a far left liberal communist marxist whatever-ist.\n\nI hear all the time that liberalism is a mental disorder.  They say that a lot.  Maybe the true mental disorder isn\'t any particular ideology but the firm belief that a single ideology has all the answers and should be taken to its extreme.  Republicanism, as an ideology, has been taken to the extreme and President Trump is the culmination of that.\n\nAnd at the risk of being cliche and bringing up Nazis, for everyone who thinks that letting Republicans fuck shit up will be enough to make the voters realize they aren\'t the answer, just look at what happened in Nazi Germany when their policies failed miserably.  They convinced their base the problems weren\'t actually caused by Nazis but rather by the Jews.  I\'m not saying Republicans are going to be rounding up liberals any time soon, but they definitely will ALWAYS offload blame for their failures onto others.  No matter how bad things get, it\'s either Obama\'s fault or the Democrats in congress.  No matter how bad things get out here in the real world with strife and bigotry, it\'ll always be "_those libtards_" that are the ones driving the hatred and the divide.\n\nWe have a serious fucking problem on our hands and frankly the only solution is to NEVER EVER BACK DOWN.  You slam people with facts, you call them out as _LIARS_ when they lie, and you point out that policy decisions based on lies are behind the resulting fallout.  You keep hammering and pushing back, because with these kinds of people, if you give them an inch they\'ll take a mile.  If you\'re silent about them blaming Obama for the rise in healthcare cost, then that\'s easily their truth and they take it farther.  Push back, point to the rise in cost prior to passing the ACA and the sudden slowing of the rise in cost after passing it.  \n \n__TL;DR:__ I refuse to allow their delusions to be my reality.'
'Do you mean to tell me the party of abstinence only education, trickle down economics, WMDs in Iraq, birthers, lying about crime states to scare people, and rejecting scientific consensus is full of shit?\n\nGet outta here!'
"Certainly all the nonsense they are spouting about the tax plan is fake.  It's economically moronic to give a massive deficit busting tax cut for the wealthy when unemployment is at 4.5%.  There is zero economic justification for massive increases in the deficit, or giveaways to the wealthy."
"Everything they do is essentially lying.  From economic policy that has 0 historical or even mathematical basis to social policy they don't believe in, everything the do is lying to their base.  They are scum, pure scum."
'Exactly right. Republicans might say it’s just trump but it’s not. It’s the entire goddamned party. The shame of America. '
'What a coincidence! I was just talking about this behavior - from earlier [this morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/792zne/musks_plant_makeover_even_more_of_a_long_shot_as/doyzdd8/):\n\n"That\'s actually a thing. It\'s called denialism. "In the psychology of human behavior, denialism is a person\'s choice to deny reality, as a way to avoid a psychologically uncomfortable truth." ... "The forms of denialism present the common feature of the person rejecting overwhelming evidence and the generation of political controversy with attempts to deny the existence of consensus."... "The motivations and causes of denialism include religion and self-interest (economic, political, financial) and defence mechanisms meant to protect the psyche of the denialist against mentally disturbing facts and ideas." - in this case the disturbing idea is financial loss/ having the status of being a failure - for example"'
'It does scare me when people pretend trump is something new and that it was just an odd happenstance he got elected.

'Rush Limbaugh proved that spewing ignorance and hatred is profitable.  And Trump being elected proved it to be true.  America has a deep hole to get out from.  It will take a huge portion of the population to come out and vote to show the world that we fucked up...'
'It\'s no accident that evangelicals are the solid foundation of Trump. It\'s those same evangelicals that have been pushing conspiracy theory, paranoia, and outright lies against Obama and the Democrats for well over a decade. It\'s those same evangelicals often appearing o  Fox news that have been propagating stories about Planned Parenthood clinics being undercover Satanist child sacrificing centers, or that Obama was intentionally letting in evil, ebola effected immigrants so he could seek another term, or Jade Helm, or Starbucks putting semen in its lattes for their gay patrons. These are all stories one can find over the last few years just by paying attention to the religious right. Is it somehow a surprise now those same tactics are deemed acceptable for Trump to use with evangelicals? They\'ve been "lying for Jesus" for money, power and control for a long, long time. '

"> Now, Sen. Coons is being fairly restrained about this. He isn’t screaming “perjury” at the top of his lungs. He’s saying that the evidence suggests that Trump Jr. provided “false testimony” which is illegal under Section 18 U.S.C. § 1001 of the criminal code. He thinks that Chairman Chuck Grassley should invite Trump Jr. back to clarify his prior testimony, which seems like a pretty generous offer. Of course, Coons thinks this should be done in a public hearing rather than a private one conducted by staff.\n\nPublic testimony by little Donny Jr. would be pretty damaging, actually. The president's son taking the fifth when questioned about his lies isn't a good look."

"He's corrupt, racist, a sexual abuser--and lazy as fuck, to boot. "

We ain't doing shit but talking shit about him aren't we? Our words won't impeach him. We aren't standing up to him, we're just supporting people who have the balls to stand up to him but how far does that get us? Words are just words until there is action. I'm guilty of it too.

They knew that just meeting with the Russians was a violation, even if everything discussed was perfectly legal.  They made sure to squelch any appearance of impropriety in the lower-echelons of the campaign.\n\nSo, it's interesting that Trump's inner-circle took secret meetings about illegal stuff!  All those excuses about Trump and his team just being new are all proven lies now.  They knew what they were doing was wrong.  This now proves it."

Pussies may think they can deal with assholes their way, but the only thing that can fuck an asshole is a dick, with some balls.

But sometimes pussies get so full of shit that they become shitholes themselves, because pussies are only an inch-and-a-half away from assholes.

"I want to see how much this has actually impacted public opinion, 'cuz this shit is spooky."
'This is how pervasive doublethink has become in our society. The true kicker here is that at least in *1984*, people actually had a vague concept of institutionalized cognitive dissonance - even if they simultaneously denied that there was ever such a thing. \n\nWe also need to consider that *Brave New World* is prophetic as well. Soma has become a metaphor for television in our society. Most "news" on TV is nothing more than distractions. Lawyers and bureaucrats arguing over Trump\'s actions while there is about another 195 countries that have shit going down that isn\'t aired for a nanosecond on mainstream media. It\'s fucking scary how hard it is for the majority of people to be exposed to world events, and what\'s even worse is the willful ignorance that most citizens have no problem acknowledging.'

"This is now a generational phenomenon.\n\nYoung people don't watch TV, so TV is less profitable, and media companies are consolidating in a typical business response.  Sinclair is the inevitable outcome.\n\nOur parents are hearing fewer opinions as their TV channels become owned by fewer and fewer companies.  Regional differences are wiped out as national content dominates.  Our parents are starting to think and act collectively, and it's playing out in our democracy:  http://college.usatoday.com/2016/11/09/how-we-voted-by-age-education-race-and-sexual-orientation/\n\nWe increasingly live in a different reality than our parents, who are still glued to their TV-sets, and apparently ignorant that they are being (easily) manipulated to act against themselves and their children.  As the world outside quickly changes, they cling tighter to their third parent, boob tube, window to the world - the only media they trust.\n\nThe TV market is shrinking, and companies are only able to wring out the last drops of value by consolidating and sensationalizing - by capturing and manipulating their audience.  Social media isn't the first to do this - they copied the master: TV.\n\nSinclair will die with our parents, as will TV content as we know it today.  The question is how strange things will get as our parents become more scared, angry, and mean as they lose themselves in their broadcast dementia."

I dont see much news about anyone standing up and doing some thing in serious and meaningful ways. I could be wrong btw. \n\nIt just seems that the most important lesson is how unprepared the american system is to deal with this sort of attack on a democratic system.

"Trump vociferously opposed the AT&T Time Warner deal (which I agree with, though I think it was wrong for a president to weigh in), but he has supported Sinclair's bid to buy Tribune, which would give Sinclair access to over 70% of US households. His hypocrisy is definitely one of the top 5 things I hate about him, and that's really saying something. Sinclair Tribune would be so bad for America. They have taken up Trumps labeling of other media as 'fake news', portraying themselves as the only honest source of information. Yet they have a very evident pro-Trump anti-liberal agenda. More than any news, local news should be fair, balanced & independent. Yet Sinclair is unabashedly biased and controlling of all their stations. We shouldn't stand for this bullshit!"

Trump\'s response was to immediately refer to [the article](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/03/13/trump-mcmaster-john-kelly-sciutto-sot-erin.cnn) reporting the imminent departure of John Kelly and McMaster, deeming the story "very exaggerated and false". Less than 24 hours later, McMaster is out.\n\nIt\'s almost as if Trump calling something fake news, inaccurate, or, say, a witch hunt means it\'ll probably turn out to be the exact opposite.'

The young men were caught red-handed stealing and admitted guilt. The father of one of the boys was wrong in saying that Trump had nothing to do with their release. Worse than that the father of one said that shoplifting is no big deal.  \nI have no idea what those three college students were thinking.

'The President was warned not to call Cohen and he did anyway. The legal bar to get this tap must have been incredibly high for this exact reason. They would have had to shown that there was on-going criminal activity. '
'Michael Cohen is fucked. Royally fucked. Wish-he’d-never-been-born fucked.'
'As a Canadian, on election night, I looked at the election of Donald Trump as a 4 year stint of some crazy news stories.\n\nNever in a million years would I have guessed that Reddit would be permanently live streaming the most absurd espionage movie ever seen. If this was an actual Hollywood movie script submitted to a studio, the writer probably would have been subjected to intensive mental health screening, for coming up with such idiotic plot twists.\n\n"... and then on page 348, he said "The president called his lawyer the day of the raid and implicated himself", can you believe this stuff?'
'They are saying Giuliani warned Trump and others weeks before the Cohen raid not to call Cohen on his phone that it might be tapped \\(again, Giuliani is getting info from SDNY Fbi, someone is giving him info\\), but his warning was ignored.

'Liar lies again. TV News networks still invite her to come on tv to lie. '
'Last night I accidentally got locked in my mudroom when our ancient door knob finally kicked the bucket. I was in the midst of taking out the trash and happened to have Anderson Cooper on. As I waited for my husband to come home, it switched to Chris Cuomo and his first guest of Kellyanne Conway. \n\nThere are many versions of hell, but last night my own personal version was being stuck in a tiny room listening to her lie over and over without being able to change the channel. '
'Trump needs an enemy to attack.  For 8 years it was Obama.  Now that people really like Obama and he\'s out of office he needs a new one.  Hillary Clinton is the new enemy.  After the election, it became "the media" and "the deep state" and "the haters and losers" but that gets a little stale and it\'s never made a ton of sense anyway.\n\nClinton is his focal point.  One person that he can get people to hate with him because she\'s so deeply unpopular.  He needs an attack to get people riled up and focused on something they hate instead of the glaring issues with something they love.  Now that she\'s gone the problem is that there\'s nobody to replace her when he needs somebody to attack so he just keeps going back to that well.  You can bet he\'ll be talking about her in three years.\n\nThe media just eats it up too.  Their gut instinct is always to try and put things into context to give people a more complete view of things.  Usually a good thing.  in this case when Trump says\n\n>Hillary Clinton had an interview where she wasn’t sworn in, she wasn’t given the oath\n\nThe media\'s gut instinct is to say "he\'s probably referring to an interview over her emails" and then people who support trump go "yeah, I do remember those f**kn emails, I hate Hillary" and they rationalize away Trump\'s wrongdoings.  I\'m not saying the media should stop contextualizing, but the unhealthy obsession with everything Trump has to stop.  Maybe just don\'t report about this story, then lump it in with 15 other cases when you want a story about how Clinton is Trump\'s crutch or how he desperately needs her.  Because that\'s important information.\n\nAlso\n\n>“We’ll see that happens. When they have no collusion – and nobody’s found any collusion at any level – it seems unlikely that you’d even have an interview.”\n\nSeriously dude?  Come on. We have 4 indictments and 2 people admitting to collusion.'
'You know, with all this obsession over Hillary you have to wonder if she\'s the crush Trump never won over, and what we\'re hearing is the rambling of a \'nice guy.\' \n\nYou know, the ones that come on all lovey-dovey but can\'t help flipping the switch to "Get fucked and die, bitch!" Bill, of course, is the Chad Trump couldn\'t compete with.\n\nSorry, Melania, but older women do have their charms.'
"I miss the old days when the entire White House press staff would be committed to an emergency spin of whatever bullshit action the president took and then he would just go on TV and personally blow his own narrative out of the water.\n\nSpicer:  It's unquestionable that the president fired Comey over the Russia investigation.  You should feel bad for even thinking that you partisan hack.\n\n[Three Hours Later]\n\nTrump: Yeah, he was getting too handsy with all that Russian collusion stuff so I fired him.\n\nAh yes, the good old days of 8 months ago.  Literally, this has been a bit over half a year."
'**Pathological lying** (also called pseudologia fantastica and mythomania) is a behavior of habitual or compulsive lying. It was first described in the medical literature in 1891 by Anton Delbrueck.\n\nWhy anyone even *attempts* to believe statements from any person on team Dump is unfathomable.'
'Oh come on! Fake News!\n\n\n*Clearly she just misspoke!*\n\nShe meant to say "No one talks **to** Hillary Clinton"....\n\n\n/s'
"Kellyanne Conway *made up a completely fake terrorist attack that never happened* as a justification for Trump's policies. Why the fuck do the media still treat her like a remotely respectable source of information?"
'KAC belongs in federal prison. Running commercials for slave made chintzy shit made by Traitor Ivanka’s slime shops overseas. Passing off lies as “alt truth”. Fuck this walking meth pipe. '
'It\'s been said a bazillion times before, but the Republicans were screwed the minute Clinton lost because they no longer had their boogeyman to effectively beat. It was prophetic when the Trumpsters said, "Get over it. She lost."'
"> Conway’s remarks came during a 30-minute sparring match with Cuomo, who considers her a personal friend and whom she continually referred to as “Christopher.”\n\nThen get anything related to Chris Cuomo off the reddit front page. They're friends. It's theater. Cuomo invites her on _because_ she says this stupid shit, not because he wants her to stop. He's just as bad _or worse_ in this situation, because he's _pretending_ to be a real journalist who is on his viewers' side, but he's a liar, just like Conway."
"You can't make this shit up."
"My mom and dad taught me that it's cowardly to bring up someone elses indiscretions when I am being reprimanded for my own. They said it's more honorable to take your punishment like a man and move forward. They said others may get punished for their wrong doings and sometimes they may not but in the end it will probably catch up to them. They said it's not my job to point out what they did but to accept the blame for what I did. Trump must have had a shitty childhood because it doesn't seem like he was taught any lessons from an early age and now he's a giant man child. "
'The worst thing to happen to republicans was winning all three branches of government, implementing their dystopian policies — and have no Democrats to blame it on. '
'I just can\'t get past the fact that a sitting president spends hours a day watching daytime tv and posting furiously on social media when in every administration in history, the president\'s time has been such a critical resource that their days were literally scheduled to the minute.\n\nThis president, more work is probably spent on keeping him away from work in order to limit the damage he can cause.  "Adult day care" indeed.\n\nI used to at least give republican politicians the benefit of the doubt.  I dislike thinking the Dems have a monopoly on my vote, but that\'s over.  No more.  I don\'t want a single-party state but the past few years have turned me into a single-party voter.'
'Ahh, more bullshit from the “Insult my intelligence” administration. '
'Whey the FUCK are journalists still talking to that lying hack kellyanne?'
"He's pissed at her for losing. He would have preferred that she had won so he could sit at home and tweet nasty things about her. "
'Ffs stop letting her on TV.'
'She is a zombie that never dies . We might need the entire cast of Walking dead to take her off the white house.'
">‘Nobody here talks about Hillary Clinton,’\n\nThat is because she lost the election, isn't in any government position whatsoever and is just a private citizen.\n\nTrump however is president and threatens nuclear war everytime someone hurts his feelings on Twitter."
'Come on FAKE NEWS!!!  It’s clear she said no one “here” talks about Hilary Clinton, anyone paying attention knows that Trump is not all here'
'This is getting really old. I am very tired of hearing the same lies over and over again while they barely try to hide it. '

'> According to Malloch, when he exited his flight from London he was taken aside by a TSA official and an FBI agent, and separated from his wife.\n\n> He said they told him it was a felony to lie to the FBI and he told them he would "gladly" cooperate with them. According to Malloch, the agents also produced a document allowing them to seize and search his cellphone.\n\n> He said they asked him about former Trump campaign adviser **Roger Stone**, author Jerome Corsi and **WikiLeaks**.

"So much for [Dowd trying to cover up the fact that he got the idea from Trump](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-lawyer-its-time-to-fire-robert-mueller) huh?\n\nThis of course comes right after we learn [McCabe was interviewed by Mueller, and handed over Memos about his interactions with Trump, including information about Comey.](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/17/politics/mccabe-memos-trump/index.html)\n\nTrump will likely try to fire Mueller, he's had GOP/Hannity acting as his attack dogs for months now to try to give justification for firing him or undermining the investigation. That's all the Nunes memo, or the HPSCI GOP ending the investigation, or the Peter Strzok texts were trying to do. Find some false justification for ending the Mueller probe. There is a reason all the conspiracy comes from the same clowns. \n\nRosenstein will not fire Mueller though. So Trump will have to try to get rid of him as well.

"Mark my words fellow Americans, what you're seeing is the beginning of an attempt at a Dictatorship...firing everyone in the White House, firing the heads of the FBI, CIA...sound familiar? This was the same thing done at the start of Nazi Germany. Now a President who is an undisputable traitor is now trying to end all investigations against him. This is the beginning (Not exactly beginning as we've all seen this coming and have been for quite some time despite the media doing its best....Fox News and associates, to shut it down) of a man trying to consolidate power among his cronies and erase the truth. Get ready for a very interesting time in history. One where a corrupt leader tries to ruin his country in order to seek power and money...naturally at the expense of all others. We as a country will continue to be lied to, our media censored, and the facts swayed. Trump is a dangerous man, let there be no doubt, lest the history of corruption of so many shitty leaders be forgotten through thousands of years.

'As an Eagle Scout\'s mom and wife of a former Scoutmaster I am appalled at the Scouts\' silence on Trump\'s appalling action, which violated every Scout rule such as courtesy and kindness. He used profanity, engaged in political views, got Scouts to boo a former President, taught Scouts to disrespect media as "fake news" and made a crude remark with sexual innuendo about his wealthy friend\'s actions aboard a yacht. Scouts should make clear this president will never be invited back and should issue a written apology to all 45,000 Scouts and families present, and all Scout members, explaining that this was a violation of Scout\'s policies and that Scouts should show respect to others at all times. The leaders who stood silently on the stage or worse, snickered, should be asked to resign. This is intolerable. There are thousands of angry comments from Scouting parents on the BSA website which so far have been ignored. Shame on the Boy Scouts for setting such a terrible example for young boys.'
"If I see an old Hitler speech, I don't get what made him appeal to people.  He seems like a loud, angry, loony psychopath drunk on power.  When I watch Trumps speech I don't get it either.  It's just scary shit and bragging.  Voters in swing states really fucked up this century on that night"

'[Do these 2 look similar at all?] (http://imgur.com/7dposNf)\n\nTrump is doing exactly what Hugo Chavez did to undermine democracy. Chavez was democratically elected, but during his campaign and while he was president, he attacked the country\'s institutions to cheers around the country.\n\n He started getting opposition from the media and from the courts, so he started firing judges, silenced journalists with anti-defamation laws, and *he described the media as "enemies of the homeland".* \n\nThe worst part of all of this is that it was all completely legal. Nothing he did was ever illegal. HE still screwed up Venezuela with his powers. After some time he eventually got a majority of the country to go against democratic institutions.\n\nThe Constitution is *really* bad when it comes to protecting us against assaults of democracy like this.'
'That speech was a little too similar to stuff from 1930s Germany.\n\nHitler literally had a "Hitlerjugend" (Hitler Youth) program to get to kids early so they\'d think of him as their leader for life. Needless to say Hitler wasn\'t having them do bake sales to raise money for the needy. \n\nTrump got tired of people comparing him to Hitler so he read up on the dude so he could *become him*. '
"Ya, no shit. It was frightening when you look at the entire situation. A sea of youth, being inundated with propaganda, encouraged to disrespect former Presidents, and listening to dangerous and false rhetoric.\n\nThat's not normal."
'Upvote for visibility if desired:\n\nSteve Bannon has been reading books about fascism and how it came into power. He is the one pulling the strings on how Trump can turn America into a fascist state. \n\nMark my words: Trump is, without a shadow of a doubt, the closest modern equivalency to Adolph Hitler. What makes that worse, is that he is a dumb Hitler, taking advice from those who are actively trying to break the State. '
'Pro tip: If you guys EVER want even the SLIGHTEST bit of legitimacy, stop these ridiculous "manufactured outrage" headlines.\n\nNobody is buying the bullshit you\'re selling, besides a bunch of Snowflake Redditors.'
"I'm an Eagle Scout, and I find this infuriating. The fact that he would use a speech to a crowd of Boy Scouts as an opportunity to hurl childish insults at a former president is beyond unconscionable."
'And people gave you shit when you said that he was going to go full Hitler at some point. The signs were there from the beginning. This is exactly why there was a worldwide outrage when he was voted president of the USA. '
"As an Eagle Scout, I'm appalled by this nonsense. This man deserves no one's obedience. He isn't helping anyone, he isn't physically strong, he isn't mentally awake, and he isn't morally straight.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America leadership needs to do the right thing and distance themselves from President Donald J. Trump's inappropriate comments and conduct. You can let the man say what he wants. However, you can not stand by and let it corrupt our organization, and more importantly, the minds of todays youth."
"That's quite the fear mongering headline you got yourself there."
"What a shit aritcle. It doesn't even use a single quote of the speech in it.\n\nIf I wanted to see what some random guy tweeted about I'd follow him on Twitter.\n\nI read news aritcles for news!! Quote it. Write your own opinions. Don't share 2 tweets and write 1 ½ paragraphs about it that state noting.\n\n\nMost of the article was about Obama in 2010 lol because sadly 2 likes is a major portion of this shit aritcle.\n\n/Rant"
'The damage being done in just 6 months will last for generations. Sucks to be an american these days.'
"Remember, after the Worst Generation finally kicks the bucket, we'll have the Twittler Youth to watch out for."
"I don't know if they're Hitler Youth yet....but what is true is that, as usual, Trump took an opportunity to make everything about himself and take cheap shots at his political opponents. It wasn't about the BSA. It was about him. For that reason alone it was completely disgraceful. But Trump would never know that because he has no sense of shame. Just another embarrassing day in this failing country."
'ITT: blind trump loyalists triggered by criticism of their man crush who is the bigly-ist "triggered snowflake" since Frosty the Snowman met the sun.'

'I feel like this has been said for the past year, but this has to cross some kind of line, right?\n\nHe’s literally threatening nuclear war on fucking Twitter.'
"Just saw this tweet mortify me in real time. I can't believe this is the President of the United States. What the hell is going on anymore? This man is *insane*. Congress or his cabinet via the 25th Amendment MUST remove him from office, like tonight. \n\n**edit:** It looks like Trump [keep going tonight as if he's in the middle of a psychotic breakdown](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948359545767841792). This is just utter madness. People with Republican Senators and Reps, CALL THEIR OFFICES AND LEAVE A MESSAGE ABOUT HOW CONCERNING THIS BEHAVIOR IS AND AS A CONSTITUENT YOU DEMAND THEY DO THEIR JOB and *put a fucking END to this insanity immediately*\n\nSomething is UP. This is beyond the pale even for Trump standards. I think someone else is getting indicted.\n\n**edit 2:** Seems like tonight's NYT piece might have something to do with this meltdown. Curiously it keeps getting removed from this sub, so I won't link it. Will any of the mods here explain why this highly politically relevant article is instantly removed the second it is posted here? Thanks.\n\n**edit 3:** The NYT piece has finally made it's way out of the removal queue. I was referring to the Op-Ed written by  Glen Simpson and Peter Fritsch - cofounders of Fusion GPS. It's an explosive fucking story, I highly suggest people read it. Republicans are refusing to release Fusion GPS's testimony because it destroys their false narrative that the Steele Dossier is what started the FBI investigation into Trump campaign colluding with the Russians. Simpson and Fritsch are all but demanding and daring Congress to release all 21 hours of their testimony, because it illuminates some serious shit - such as Trump has been laundering Russian money via Deutsche Bank for a long time, that the dossier was NOT the impetus for the investigation into collusion (it corroborated what tons of other sources were already providing the IC and FBI).. and amongst other things already known... **that there was a mole inside the Trump camp feeding intel to the feds from the jump!** This shit is wild."
'If I threatened to slap someone on Twitter I’d be banned.  This motherfucker is threatening nuclear war on Twitter and no one bats a fucking eye at corporate.  WTF are we doing here ladies and gents?'
"There's a guy on MSNBC right now flat out saying that Trump has a preoccupation with size like most insecure men because he is massively insecure about his sexuality and masculinity, and that he is threatening to make this planet no longer habitable because of his obsession with the size of his penis. "
'Jesus fucking Christ. Dude threatens nuclear war on twitter, AND AT THE END OF IT HE IS ADVERTISING FOR SEAN FUCKING HANNITY!!!!!! WHAT THE FUCK!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?! '
"If this bullshit leads to a nuclear strike in my lifetime I'm going to fucking scream."
"You know who I really fucking hate? Everyone of those goddamn people who said during 2016 that Hillary Clinton is the same (if not worse) than Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton would've never hinted that her pussy was tighter than Angela Merkel's during a tweetstorm about nuclear annihilation.\n\nTrump supporters have an excuse - they were conned, but anti-Clinton liberals knew EXACTLY how monstrous this man was and refused to do the ONE thing that could've stopped him."
"hahahaha he's triggering liberals so hard guys hahahaha we're all gonna die! WINNING! MAGA! NUCLEAR WAR, YEAHHHHHHH!!!!\n\nI can already see his supporters saying this.\n\n"
'I saw this tweet, said "well then" and kept scrolling because I expected nothing less.\n\nThat is a fucking scary reaction to have for someone tweeting their intention of nuclear war '
"Yah know, fuck this i'm over impeachment, thats not even nearly good enough at this point. They had a chance to clean up their mistake before it metastasized into this. He is trying his hardest to provoke the start of a nuclear war, literally. I pray that he dies in his sleep soon and we can step back from the brink."
'On top of threatening nuclear war on fucking twitter, the leader of the free world just mocked starving NK civilians? He has no limit or line does he?'
"And Twitter still won't fucking ban him. Fuck him. Fuck Twitter."
'Member when people said he would not be trusted with nuclear codes and all the low iq people responded with "Nah she will start WW3, her emails!!!". Member?'
"It's bad when we have to hope Kim Jong Un is the more rational leader. Trump is trying so hard to goad him into a shooting war. "
"The word insane gets thrown around a lot. But this man is insane. He is not well. He should be removed from office immediately for the good of the country and the continued survival of the human race.\n\nBut he won't be. Because tax cuts and liberal tears, lol."

"Can twitter do humanity a solid and block Trump's account for inciting violence? It's not even thinly veiled. He's literally threatening nuclear war."
'Remember when Obama told Kim Jong Un and NK "We could destroy you!" and nobody freaked the fuck out in America? Why the outrage now?'
'The fuck. I swear if South Korea gets nuked because of a dick measuring contest...'
'Reading the Twitter comments for this post is absolutely terrifying. His supporters are mentally ill, they are literally cheering on nuclear war like it\'s some kind of sporting event. Trump supporters are actually calling for millions of people to die in a nuclear war... let that sink in a Minute. If you have family or friends in the military there is a good chance that they are going to die so Trump can defend his tiny dick. Americans are going to die for what? Republican politicians are going to allow Americans to die and do nothing about because their team "won". Something has to be done and I mean soon. Your life and the lives of everyone you know will depend on what WE do about this madman.'
'This man is a goddamn lunatic and needs to be put away in an institution as a case study.\n\nThis is a borderline threat of nuclear war. \nThat’s fucking terrifying.'
"I've commented in this thread a lot but i just cant get over this. Trump is like actually insane. There is actually something broken in him. We are fucked. I mean seriously Fucked."
'Legit this is the reason we take the presidency away from this dude. It is actually not ok to be threatening nuclear warfare on twitter. This is beyond the pale and should not be normalized. '
'This is the second time in 24 hours that he’s publicly insulted nuclear powers and it’s obvious that the CIA and Mossad have initiated war efforts against Iran.  This son of a bitch is doing his damndest to antagonize someone enough that they take a swing at us so he can go to war with the hope of improving the GOPs chances in 2018 and his own in 2020.  And the cowards in Congress will sit idly by and let it happen without lifting a finger.'
'Calling it now, there will be a fatal heart attack in the near future. '
'Trump is such a piece of shit. Total disgrace to everything the presidency stands for. '
"Jesus Fucking Christ TWITTER do Your Fucking Job! If I threatened millions of lives on twitter I'm sure I'd get banned in a fucking heartbeat."

'The deficit hawks are as quiet and as frightening as a dead canary in a coal mine'
'House prices have stalled in most of the country.  Just wait until people are underwater on their mortgages again.  \n\nNot enough millennials have the money or want to live in the suburbs.  A lot of suburbs over the years have stripped money from schools and social services.  Who the fuck wants to live in a place like that except selfish old baby boomers?  '
"This was intentional and will be used to justify the slashing of services for the poor. It's called class warfare."
'and most expect the economy to slow down in 2020.\n\nrepublicans do this all the time, run up the debt and deficit, during an exploding economy.. which if you want to pretend the government is like a household, thats when you pay your bills.. thats when you raise taxes. \n\nand then when the economy slows, we are left in a much harder position of dealing with it.(if you dont save when times are good, you are more fucked when times are bad). even a trumpet should be able to understand that.\n\nin the end, the next dem president will pay for the republican party.. and get blamed for it. We will get another sequester.. if we are lucky we might get to roll back some of the republican tax cuts, but we wont get new taxes on top of that.. which is what we need.. but not during a recession or a slow economy.. which we will have in 2020 when we will have a dem president.\n\nRepublicans really have this shit down pat. Under bush it was nothing but tax cuts and new programs with zero funding. That shit is actually popular overall. and does increase the economy some, just like if you choose to not pay any of your bills, your personal economy would seem to increase, you suddenly have a lot of party money for the money.. but next month is gonna suck balls. When you decide to start paying your bills again.\n\nand they left t to obama to fix.. it has two effects. We dont have the money for a lot of progressive dreams.. it hamstrings the dem from raising taxes on the rich as that can make a slow economy slower, and the dems polling goes down when he cuts spending to help fix our massive deficits.\n\nits insidious as all fuck and effective.\n'
'It\'s fucking insane that this barely registers on the list of upsetting news out of the Trump "presidency" this week. And shit is only going to get worse.'
'“Fuck up the economy, get Democrats elected to fix it, blame Democrats for shitty economy we created, get elected on this, rinse/repeat”\n\nThis shit is getting old'
'Get your affairs in order.\n\nAnother recession is coming.  If not a full Depression.\n\nThis tax scam did not give any money to households to manage their debt.  All of the windfalls went to the hyper wealthy and to corporations who used it to buy back their own stock, enabling another stock bubble.\n\nI am hesitant to state that this was designed to further cripple the middle class, widening the gap between haves and have\\-nots to keep the proletariat economically incapacitated. That would take some masterful economic planning.  However, that will be the result\n\nMany of the policies that the Republicans have finally been empowered to enact are similar to how South American and Central American dictatorships have suppressed their populations through economic warfare.  Look to recent monetary policies in Argentina, Chile, further back Nicaragua, Guatemala.  This is what the powerful want for America.\n\nHope your financial house is in order. Bankruptcies and foreclosures coming, faster than most imagine.'
'So it appears that we have money to kill Arabs in the Middle East in Wars for Oil and shipping rights, but none for Universal Healthcare and Universal College Tuition?  That makes a lot of sense.'

'Republicans know that while the debt is a great talking point against a Democratic president voters don\'t vote based on the national debt. Republican politicians and voters alike were gnashing their teeth at how Barack Obama was saddling all of our kids with mountains of debt and the same fucking people in office now couldn\'t give a shit how high it is.\n\nBut don\'t worry, the moment Democrats are back in the slightest position of power the debt and "entitlement reform" (and Paul Ryan already wants to get a head start on entitlements) will be the number two issue (number one will of course remain the immigration xenophobic culture war) that is all the Democrats fault again and I worry Democratic Leadership will once again pretend the rules apply only when we are in power and play the game.'

'A trifling error. Anybody could have made that kind of mistake. '
"Looking at the comments, I'm struck how Trump supporters respond by attacking, mocking, insulting non-Trump supporters (which they infuriatingly lump together in a single 'leftist/dem' category) while non-Trump supporters are criticizing Trump/the situation. Is that where we still are with Trump supporters? Defending him is difficult so they attack others who they perceive have differing views?\nEdit: I'm not saying all supporters/non-supporters fall into this category, just that the top comments on the article seem to reflect this  "
'It\'s still mind-blowing to think that the *USA* currently has a president who answers criticism with infantile "no, *you* are"-type  responses, tries to fire advisors who have already quit in protest, and reacts to boycotts of events by saying "well, I\'m not going then".\n\nHe is as inspirational a leader as a dog turd.'
'The Kennedy Center understands what nobody else seems to.  The normal media response to this type of behavior from Trump is to express outrage, denounce him, analyze the situation, be outraged some more, analyze the situation some more, invite some pundits to be outraged, and continue the cycle until a squirrel runs by and distracts them.  \n\nThe guy is a toddler.  He acts out because he wants attention.  I guarantee there are some well qualified parents at the Kennedy Center.'
'Everything this eunuch touches fails miserably. '

"Of course they would because the their egos wouldn't be confused.  How can they go against trump when they invested their reputations  on him?   You see this is the old gambler fail.  They don't know when to walk away from the table and minimize the losses.  They just cannot admit they are playing a rigged game."
'Imagine if Obama did this shit for a moment.\n\n“This dumb fucking liberal is gonna send all your jobs to China and Mexico cause he doesn’t understand the basic economics of tariffs.”\n\nCurrently with Trump.\n\n“I say good on him. Trump is trying to make this country great again and bring jobs back here to America for Americans. We don’t need the approval of any of these other countries, fuck em.”\n\nNo self-awareness and they will fuck themselves as a result.'
'The only wall we need in this country is around every red state, we don’t need anymore stupid spreading. We can see how well they do on their own. Sometimes it blows my mind that these idiots keep voting for republicans when their states are generally the poorest and least educated. Like I always say, if stupid people didn’t exist, there would be no Republican Party. '
'I hope Fox Business is at the least able to convince Trump to drop these tariffs.\n\nThey are bad for our trading partners, and the WORST for America at large.\n\nBecause the countries we are putting tariffs on are just putting similar ones on us, meaning we\'re both costing each other a lot of money over something stupid.\n\n"Make America Broke Again"\n\nI can\'t believe he thought this was a good idea.'
'Every single thing this White House says or does would have been met with threats, vitriol and disgust the likes of which I don\'t think we\'ve seen in our lifetimes had they been done or said under the Obama administration.\n\nConservatives, Republicans, the alt-right, the "anti establishment", whatever you want to call those who voted for and still support this administration are disgusting cowards.'
"Truth be told when this turns to shit and drives the world into a recession it will be, through jello brain logic, Obama's fault somehow."
"I have to look away sometimes, because this shit is just too fucking insane to be real life. It is like the gop base just put the drunkest guy at the wheel and theyre fucking thrilled that we're going to hit a brick wall. They might die, but it's alright if it hurts the libruls too. And theyre just fucking thrilled with themselves over it. There won't be a single farmer out there who voted for Trump and fucking has the brain cells to regret it when retaliatory tariffs leave them unable to sell their crop. At least they can control what bathroom people can piss in. Theyre suicidally stupid and our lives are too inextricably linked for us to let them die off and do us all an evolutionary favor. And the disease is built with some nasty self-propagators in there. They ruin the education system, teach things from their insane perspective (teach the controversy, Civil War had nothing to do with slavery), they have a massive media conglomerate that literally warps reality in the minds of the superstitious and malleable. That media conglomerate is also like a hydra in that it is made up of so many disparate groups, independent content producers all the way to multi-billion dollar companies like Faux News. It is self-replicating and recursive. I don't see how this all resolves without a lot of blood being shed."

"Yeah I know this might look bad for Trump, but if I was one of the victims in Texas, Trump would be the last person I would want to see.\n\nWe already know he doesn't give a shit, why bother pretending and fucking up the area more with all the bullshit he'll bring along."
"Didn't you know Trump is the real victim because of the fake news media?"
"While I'm not defending or deriding Trump, presidents need to stay the hell away from disaster areas. The strain placed on already over strained response forces like police is a negative. Let them do their jobs, a president's job is to coordinate and direct the various agencies. You're not going to roll up your sleeves and start digging through rubble and such."
'Mark my words, when the FEMA applications start coming in and this starts getting expensive, Trump *will* insinuate at some point that the reason/one of the reasons it costs so much is because of illegal immigrants in Houston sending in requests. He will find a way to tie the cost of this to illegal immigrants in some way. Just a matter of time... '
"Come on guys, I oppose just about everything Trump does but is this really worth getting mad over? He sent help, he went, and that's still not good enough. What more can he do? And what would it matter if he did meet with victims? They just lost literally everything and seeing Donald Trump for five minutes is supposed to make that better how? \n\nTrump does tons of stuff worth criticizing, but I don't think this qualifies. Remember how the right blamed everything on Obama? Lets not stoop to that level and focus on things he has actually done wrong. "
'I like to pop by this sub once in a while just to observe and point out how the level of discussion and insight has devolved into little more than an expletive-shouting mob that will hate Trump literally no matter what he does.\n\nIf he had visited victims, you can bet he\'d be hated for "getting in the way" or "disrupting emergency services", or "risking lives", or "staging a photo op" or "using hurricane victims as props to improve his popularity rating" or whatever else. The POTUS has no choice but to travel around with a massive entourage of security personnel - it is very disruptive to go basically anywhere, let alone somewhere like a hurricane shelter while the disaster is ongoing. \n\nIf you hate a president enough, you can find ways to insult and criticize no matter where they go, what they do, or what they say. That\'s all this sub has become. There is no meaningful discussion, no reasoning, nothing that would be considered conversation in a substantive sense. Just insults and expletives and hate.\n'
'I will play Devil\'s advocate even though I hate the man.  I don\'t think the Secret Service would allow him to meet with anyone because they could not guarantee his safety. Even at his "speech" yesterday, he was several hundred feet away from the crowd and behind vehicles.  Even though this is a time of crisis, he is an unpopular person and someone might use it as an opportunity to attack him.  '
"Did it occur to any of you that this victims are trying to get relief and the president being there would cause a disruption? Use your brains. This just happened and people are still waiting for relief. Why don't you quit your selfish trump hating bullshit for one day. It's getting really pathetic. "
"Oh boo hoo. If he did I would be reading about how he is faking sympathy and he doesn't actually care about them. \n\nThe victims don't want to be part of a publicity stunt by trump. (Which is all it would be) "
'This is some leftist propaganda, character attack after character attack. '
"This is all nonsense. If I'd just been flooded and rendered homeless. I don't think I'd care about the president.  Only thing he should be criticized for is if he can't get congress to pass funding for the recovery effort "
"Really? Are we actually concerned that he didn't meet with flood victims? I concede that it it's odd that he didn't, but it's not actually newsworthy in any way. A subreddit about politics is concerned about who Trump shool hands with.\n\nRemember how Obama was swamped with sensationalist reporting that distracted from his policies and practices? This is the exact same thing, and it pushes focus away from the actual issues surrounding Trump's presidency."
"When I was in the red cross shelter after Karina, the last thing I'd want to see is some politician using me for a photo op. Did Bush meet with Katrina victims? I don't know because it wouldn't have helped my situation at all.\n\nTrump does enough bad shit that we don't need to focus on petty shit like this. I remember that i thought Republicans were so immature calling out Obama for every tiny thing. I guess the tables have turned, and now the left has to out immature the right. Can't wait to see how toxic people are when we flip back to a Democrat for president\n\n"
'And if he did, you guys would say he did it as a political stunt to look good\n\n"Leave these people alone!  They just went through a disaster and you\'re using it as a publicity stunt!"\n\nAlso, just yesterday, this sub was bitching that his motorcade would ruin traffic and cause issues. Now you WANT his motorcade near the flood zone so he can see victims?'
'Lol trump could cure cancer and there still would be a negative post on this sub. '
"First you cried because he wasn't down there. Then you cried because him going down there took some resources that could've been used on helping the locals. Now you cry because they didn't arrange a photo-op with some of the victims. This sub in a nutshell. But don't worry, we're only a few REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEs away from impeachment! Any day now! lmao."
"Why does it matter? If he had, you would be criticizing him for doing a photo op or seeking to aggrandize himself while people were still suffering. This kind of nitpicking is stupid. What matters is the government's actual actions, not the orange in chief's photo ops. "
"I hate Trump as much as the next guy but it would't help the victims who are in crisis mode any and everyone would pounce on him accusing him of photo-op. Trump is due to come back to Texas and meet victims then anyway."
"Does it matter? y'all already ran out of sane shit to complain about huh"
"I don't like Trump but disaster areas requested that he avoid those areas so that he wouldn't disrupt their strategy.\n\nHe's coming to visit victims in a few days"
'Did anyone actually expect Melania to ruin her $800 stilettos wading through the nasty flood water.  Trophy wives are above that!\n\n^/s'
"I actually understand why he didn't. I'm no fan of the guy, I think he's scum, but getting close to the affected areas would only drain more assets away from rescue efforts and take attention away from the refugee efforts. If I was in his position, I wouldn't get near it right now, either. \n\nIt's a cluster fuck wherever he goes, and these people don't need any for of a cluster fuck than they're already dealing with.\n\nThat being said, the guy's still a piece of shit peddling his new hats and mentioning crowd size. "
'This is disgusting nitpicking you people have totally lost it. '
"As a native Houstonian, I want to point out that this is actually a great thing. I don't think he suddenly has a conscious or anything, but if he did try to get into our city it would a fucking mess. Our main thoroughfares are fucking congested to hell. I can't even get to the outer suburbs to check on my extended family because the flooding is so severe and cops have been turning people back the our reservoirs are too dangerous to let people in.\n\nOn top of having no good way to get his motorcade in, or even having a functioning airport for him to land in, our hotels have been extending refuge to people displaced from the storms, and our police don't have any fucking time to mess around with his escorts or protecting him from protestors. \n\nThen there's the fact that Republican or democrat, liberal or conservative, none of that shit matters right now. If you're in trouble, we're saving you, if you need help, we're giving it to you. No one wants him in the city right now, no one wants to think about polarizing politics, no one wants to deal with the stress that he brings everywhere he goes. \n\nThe best thing the president can be doing right now is staying the fuck out of the way so that rescue operations and relief efforts can keep going as smoothly as they can. Republican representatives are saying this, democratic representatives are saying this. We don't need Airforce One, we need clothes, warm meals, and space for people to stay because they don't have homes.\n\nDonald Trump is the fuck up uncle that at least has the decency to stay in the waiting room to respect the wishes of a hurting family. Don't blame him for flying in to Texas and staying in Austin. He plans on coming into the city once everything has stabilized, and while I'm not thrilled about that, I'm really fucking happy that he has the common sense to not make matters worse."
"First off, I'm no big fan of trump. But the liberal media is making any small detail of trumps life seem more preposterous than it really is. Everything has to be political and hint towards Trump's incompetence, or poor character. This story implies trump doesn't care about the victims of Texas. All in all, this article seems extremely disingenuous and out of touch with real issues. "
"I'm no fan of Trump by any means, but who cares if he didn't personally meet with any victims?\n\nI hate when politicians do that fake shit. If he wants to show that he cares, he wouldn't be doing photo-ops (which is what it is) by doing handshakes with victims, he''d be sending in aid and relief to those victims.\n\n\nIf I was a victim and I just lost my home and my dog, I wouldn't want to see Trump there smiling and shaking hands with me while 300 people took pictures, I'd want a box of food and water and maybe some porno mags to relieve some stress."
"Are you people not seeing the scope and size of this flooding?  It would have been next to impossible for ANY President to meet with people largely affected by this crisis.  It's entirely possible he will visit with them as waters recede.  \n\n"
"Really people? Really? What exactly should he have done to make all of you happy? Sit with a family who have just lost EVERYTHING and ask how they are feeling? Or maybe jump on a fanboat and pluck some citizens from their flooded yard? This man can't win. If he showed up in a shelter, you would have said he was grandstanding - showing off for the cameras. Looking for a photo op. But have him make a speech to convey his and our country's support and our commitment to help - and all you can do is pile on some more hate. Hate for him and by extension, hate for these flood victims. I'm quite sure that the LAST thing they need or want is a Presidential entourage showing up to make an already chaotic situation even more disruptive. These are families, with elderly folks and scared kids. The disaster is STILL HAPPENING! But all of you think the President needs to hug a few kids and shake some hands? I'm a Trump supporter (unapologetically) who came to this thread to see how many of you would seriously throw hate/shade/negativity about the President's decision to speak DAYS into an unimaginable catastrophe. Sure enough, you didn't disappoint. Go ahead. Flame away."
'I didn\'t even vote for Trump but these types of articles are an embarrassment to the progressive cause.   \n\nIf Trump had met victims, the narrative would be "look how much money and resources were wasted so the president could meet with these people. Trump is just taking advantage of this huge disaster to boost ratings."  '
'I hate Trump, but he is returning to meet victims this weekend.'
"Well, socialism is the answer to hurricanes, isn't it?  Because if we relied purely on private market capitalist solutions lile insurance, people are SOL.    National disasters don't help republicans.  "
"Why are we criticizing him for this?  I mean, haven't these poor flood victims suffered enough?"

Or can it just "protest" the existence of Donald Trump on this planet?  That\'s asinine.\n\nSecond, a great big picture of a neo-Nazi greets readers in a story about Trump.  Intentional?  Why lead with a picture captioned "White nationalists and white supremacists" when they aren\'t the ones protesting against Trump?  Are these white nationalists and white supremacists all  Trump supporters?  Are you trying to link white nationalism to Trump?  Weird because, again, the article is about protesters *against* Trump.

There was one before DJ Jr's meeting/emails were revealed, and the timing of the NFL/Puerto Rico tweetstorm matches this timeframe perfectly.  \n  \nedit 2: The cycle as I see it:  NYT/WaPo/WSJ/Atlantic/Whomever Reputable gets scoop on story from source, vets source and story, and preps for publishing ---->  \nNewspaper reaches out to Trump/Mueller team for comment before publishing (my guess is around 7-10 days before) ------>   \nTrump tweets something stupid or says something stupid that's a red herring with regards to current events [clarifying, the two examples of this recently are the transgender soldier ban and the NFL tweets, given both issues weren't being discussed much, if at all, by either side in the political sphere and Trump pulls these out his ass to rile up both sides in a shock event], Trump also contacts people in the far-right to start discrediting story before it comes out------>  \nmajor story gets published by said source ------>   \nfar right decries it as Fake News  \n  \nedit 3: formatting and clarification.

'[Narcissists \\(and, often, by contagion, their unfortunate victims\\) don’t talk, or communicate. They fend off. They hide and evade and avoid and disguise. In their planet of capricious and arbitrary unpredictability, of shifting semiotic and semantic dunes – they perfect the ability to say nothing in lengthy, Castro\\-like speeches.](https://mental-health-matters.com/talking-to-a-narcissist-the-weapon-of-language/)\n\nThe ensuing convoluted sentences are arabesques of meaninglessness, acrobatics of evasion, lack of commitment elevated to an ideology. The narcissist prefers to wait and see what waiting brings. It is the postponement of the inevitable that leads to the inevitability of postponement as a strategy of survival.\n\nIt is often impossible to really understand a narcissist. The evasive syntax fast deteriorates into ever more labyrinthine structures. The grammar tortured to produce the verbal Doppler shifts essential to disguise the source of the information, its distance from reality, the speed of its degeneration into rigid “official” versions.\n\n...\n\nNarcissists, therefore, never talk to others – rather, they talk at others, or lecture them. They exchange subtexts, camouflage\\-wrapped by elaborate, florid, texts. They read between the lines, spawning a multitude of private languages, prejudices, superstitions, conspiracy theories, rumours, phobias and hysterias. Theirs is a solipsistic world – where communication is permitted only with oneself and the aim of language is to throw others off the scent or to obtain Narcissistic Supply.'

Trump is Trump and all Trump cares about is himself. Someone that can't see beyond their own bubble does no good for anyone at all. The sad part is being presidential, or being a leader at all, is knowing how to rally the troops. It's knowing your audience. Every audience and every situation. Trump simply doesn't have the people skills or social cues to pull stuff like that off. He doesn't care that your child was killed because who are you? That's literally his entire philosophy on life.

'What is this bullshit term "false facts"? Thats not a real thing. A fact is a true piece of information. The opposite of that is a lie. This should read "Donald trump tells lies about Obama\'s presidential pardons." Fer fuck sake'
'Obama got called a liar by a member of congress during a state of the union, weird to see such refrain. Call him a fucking liar already.'
'FFS. "false facts"? Can we stop sugar coating this shit. **These are lies.** Not calling it what it is isn\'t "being politically correct", it\'s just bad journalism.'
"Why does Donald Trump feel the need to confirm that he's a lying sack of shit on a daily basis?"
"Hahah - yes: getting convicted and going to jail is no different than not going to jail. I know words are hard for y'all, but a pardon isn't the same as commuting a sentence. Ya see, a pardon can happen at any time - commuting means the person is serving time. Was Joe psycho pants serving time? No? So it isn't the same at all? Did Chelsea fake an assassination plot against herself and then put someone in jail for it? No? Huh - so not at all the same thing. And even if it were- mutha fucking whataboutism. Weak as fuck. When I got caught stealing as a kid, ratting out my brothers didn't make me innocent. Accusing others isn't a defense - it's a sad, lazy distraction. "
'So basically the re-tweet used the word "pardoned" when it should\'ve used the word "commuted." I don\'t think the difference is terribly consequential—both actions stem from the President\'s constitutional pardon power, and both can be controversial. I find this to be a rather pedantic criticism. '

"The porn star payment is interesting, but during the interview, giuliani said this:\n\n>[“He fired Comey because Comey would not — among other things — say that he wasn’t a target of the investigation.

"> Giuliani contradicted the president’s stories on potential obstruction of justice, the Stormy Daniels affair, and even his relationship with fixer Michael Cohen.\n\nHe said he repaid him, by funneling it through a law firm (opens up finance records of the law firm for subpoena) on a schedule (possibly illegal in itself)\n\nHe said\n> [Trump fired Comey because he wouldn't assure him FBI was not targeting him in Russia probe](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/giuliani-trump-russia-probe-comey-latest-robert-mueller-target-a8333826.html)\n\nAnd he also implicated himself as a potential witness to the Michael Cohen trial - so there is that too.\n\n> “When I heard Cohen’s retainer of $35,000, **when he was doing no work for the president**, I said that’s how he’s repaying it, with a little profit and a little margin for paying taxes for Michael.”\n\n> That also bolstered the argument from federal prosecutors in Manhattan that much of what was seized in the **Cohen raid is not protected by attorney-client privilege**, as he was “in fact, performing little to no legal work.”\n\nSo not a single shred of evidence is protected, possibly.\n\n> By not reporting a loan from Cohen meant to aid the election of Donald Trump, **the campaign would have violated the law**. Had Cohen not been repaid, the violation was his own, as an agent of the campaign making a contribution to it of that size.\n\nGiuliani also said he does(did?) the same payment type things for his clients without them knowing.\n\n> “But he did know about the general arrangement that Michael would take care of things like this. I take care of things like this for my clients,” Giuliani said. “I don’t burden them with every single thing that comes along. These are busy people.”\n\n[Avenatti right now](https://imgur.com/uzaP94L)\n\nWhat a night Rudy, here I was saying you weren't going to end it in two weeks - you pull this on day 13.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAvenatti on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert just indicated that he has similar stories from over 15(ish?) women that is the same as Stormy Daniels.

"People are celebrating this too early.  I think this is the best play Trump has. This is Giuliani recognizing that Mueller can 100&#37; prove why Comey was fired and also the seized Cohen documents will 100&#37; prove the Daniels payment. Keep in mind Muellers report on obstruction is supposed to come out in the next two months. \\(Assuming Giulani said these things with Trump's permission, I have seen it speculated he did not, but I believe he almost certainly did.\\)   \n\nBy doing this now they soften the blow and take the only positions that they possibly can prior to actual litigation and the Mueller report proving why Comey was fired getting to Congress. They have to pretend this has always been their story and it's completely fine once they acknowledge the reality that there is a mountain of evidence of Trumps purpose when firing Comey.  \n\nEdit: for list format and add 5.\n\n1. Lester Holt Interview  \n\n2. What Trump said to the Russians in oval office.  \n\n3. Trumps constant tweets about fighting with the DOJ. \n\n4. Trump's loyalty oath requests and Comeys memos. Remember Trump also asked Dan Coates, and Mike Rogers to interfere. And he asked McCabe who he voted for president. And he has fired and campaigned against everyone Comey talked to about his Memos.\n\n5. A number of the people in law enforcement being hounded by Trump/His Congressional pets were the GOP beloved until it was them under investigation. Specifically, Trump gave Comey a Hug and complimented his Guts, and frequently tried to be in contact with him prior to realizing Comey wasn't going to play ball. It is yet further evidence of corrupt intent that Trump's position did not go from neutral to dislike of Comey. It went from I love James Comey because of the Hillary email thing, to I hate James Comey and I am firing him because of the Hillary email thing. (His Initial lie) And then truth, Trump hates him because he investigates Trump. Trump's treatment of Preet Bharara literally went the same way and Preet's firing was also blatant obstruction.\n\n6. Mueller probably has evidence connecting Nunes actions re: the FISA memo were coordinated with the White House. Remember Nunes refused to deny that. \n\n7. The way pardons have been floated in public and frankly I bet Mueller is aware of pardons being floated in private as well. \n\n8. Mueller has way more evidence than we do publicly on this topic including Hope Hicks interview, Mark Corralo interview, Priebus interview, Sessions interview, Pompeo interivew, Coats and Rogers interview. Along with a bunch of documents and discovery.  \n\nThis is a shit defense on the facts but it is what they have.  They aren't relying on reason or law or facts anymore. They are going to go full PR blitz, rely on Fox and Breitbart to continue to have no journalist integrity and rely on Paul Ryan not to impeach.  \n\nBy tomorrow TD, the only people who believed Trump's original stories will think this is 4D checkers like Trump has been tricking people with his constantly shifting lies. When literally they are the only people gullible enough to believe anything that comes out of Trump's mouth.  \n\nPaul Ryan will come out after the Mueller report and says none of this is obstruction because Trump can do whatever the fuck he wants. Do not underestimate these peoples willingness to destroy the rule of law in whatever way is most convenient for them. "

Trump will now claim that he "now" knows that it was for SD, but that he didn\'t know it back when he filed financial disclosure forms and therefore didn\'t violate the law.\n\nTheir fallback solution, given the constantly shifting storyline, is to create a sort of fuzzy\\-Heisenberg\\-history where they\'ve given so many different contradictory stories that no one is even sure what they are actually claiming. They can keep this up as long as they never have to testify under oath.\n\nOf course, this is all retconned history, and Trump/Cohen/Giuliani are all lying through their teeth.\n\nEdit: originally I wrote "two 65K installments", corrected to $35K.'
'how many Mooches before Rudy is let go for making things worse? '
'In this thread I see people thinking Giuliani is stupid for "spilling the beans" about this. They\'re making it sound like Giuliani is inept. \n\nGiuliani is a skilled attorney and knows what he\'s doing. He probably "spilled" this fact because it\'s his position that Trump is in more legal danger if he didn\'t repay Cohen because that would constitute an illegal campaign contribution. Maybe he\'s going to try to claim that it was just a loan.\n\nI don\'t know anything for sure, this is just an idea. '

"My father died of Parkinson's. Fuck Pfizer.\n\nedit: and this is why, by the way, you don't hang all your hopes on corporations. This is why public spending on academic research is vital. So maybe don't fucking privatize everything and starve public research dollars so billionaires can have another tax cut.\n\nedit 2: To all you Rhodes scholars telling me the government has no right to dictate research policy for private corporations: read my comment. I didn't say that. I said public spending on academic research is vital. \n\nI repeat: fuck Pfizer and fuck Ajit Pai too."
"Pfizer knows that a drug that treats or delays the onset of degenerative dementia is a trillion dollar blockbuster.  They're pulling the plug on their program because it is a dead end.  Pfizer sent two drugs to stage II clinical trials, [bapineuzumab](https://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/51264/title/Pfizer-to-Halt-Alzheimer-s-and-Parkinson-s-Drug-Research/) and [Azeliragon](https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/azeliragon), they failed.  I'm not familiar with the research on either of those, but the general trend of Alzeheimer's research in the last ten years has been using mice that have a genetic mutation that causes amyloid plaque to build up in their brain, then attacking the protein clumps with artificial antibodies.  This cures mice but not people; it isn't even clear that the agglomeration of the protein is the cause of the disease rather than a secondary effect.  It takes at least eight years to get a drug to stage II human trials, and treatments for dementia take years for the effects to be noticeable- if half the patients stop deteriorating, it takes that long to notice the change in the other half.\n\nBasically, this has nothing to do with the tax cut.  Pfizer invested hundreds of millions, quite possibly billions, and it proved to be a dead end.  The laid off researchers knew their projects failed, and they undoubtedly had noticed a lack of new projects.  They're highly qualified professionals that will be employed again soon.\n\nIt isn't a political story.  If Pfizer had succeeded in developing a trillion dollar blockbuster, we could discuss how many billions they invested vs. public sector investment, but they failed.  "
'The fact this is at the top of the sub is embarrassing for us liberals.\n\nPlease please read about the state of the Alzheimer\'s field. The field has been dealing with a scientific reckoning for the past few years. A major hypothesis about the disease is turning out to maybe not be true, or at least the way we have used that hypothesis to target the disease may not be correct.\n\nPeople have used this hypothesis to cure many many mice of Alzheimer\'s disease. But mice aren\'t people. And none of those drugs have worked in people.\n\nThere are many possible explanations for why but it is going to take time and much more money to figure that out.\n\nThis is a scientific problem, not a policy one. If we\'re going to criticize Trump supporters for being willfully ignorant, we can\'t just do the same thing here.\n\nEDIT: As several people have pointed out: The problem is what scientists study in mice isn\'t really Alzheimer\'s. The mice have components of the disease, but not all of them. I was trying to write succinctly and just said "mice aren\'t people." A better summary would have been, "But mice with Alzheimer\'s-like conditions aren\'t Alzheimer\'s patients."'
"This decision was based on dead-ends in the clinic. This had nothing to do with Trump.\n\nAnd I despise Trump.\n\nEDIT: Seriously, go read about the state of Alzheimer's drug development. This is a much bigger issue. I am totally sympathetic to arguing against the tax cut logic. But this is a bad example to rest that argument on."
'Why the fuck is this being linked to the tax cut. Pfizer decided to pull the plug because they weren’t even coming close.  I hate Trump but people need to have a bit more common sense. '
'I work in R&D there. It was stopped because of trial results. Can’t say much about the money but this is common. Look up companies developing a Staph Aureus vaccine and see all the dead ends. '
'As someone with Alzheimer\'s on both sides of my family and Parkinson\'s on one side I\'ll just get this out the way; fuck Pfizer\n\nEdit: just to be clear "fuck Pfizer" isn\'t limited to this one instance. I say fuck them for a variety of reasons including their shitty practices.'
"Anti-big pharma circle jerk in here. Many Parkinson's drugs have died in the clinic. A company has no obligation to throw money into a pit. "
'Pfizer is also the company that got the government to steal land from homeowners, kicking them off their own property, so they could build new offices. Then they decided not to and the land is now empty. Look up Kelo v New London.'
'Holy hell this thread is insane. I work in the industry and this decision is absolutely from a clinical standpoint, it has nothing to do with Trump or any tax cut. You are flat out being manipulated by this headline/article.\n\nThe amount of "FUCK TRUMP" and "I HOPE THEY DIE FROM ALZHEIMERS" and other hate in this thread is just ridiculous. You all straight up do not understand clinical research/R&D - please read up and inform yourselves because this is just embarrassing. \n\nAnd, even though I know the downvotes are coming, this is coming from someone who has a dad with dementia, works in the industry in question, and thinks Trump is a clown.'
"/s incoming:\n\nThe size of this tax cut forced so much money to start trickling down to workers that they can't afford to do research any more."
'They need to kill Big Pharma ADs. Only America and New Zealand allow them.\n\nEDIT: Literally no other countries in the world allow Big Pharma to run commercials and print ads.'
"So is this anger because they got a tax break or because they're dropping Alzheimers research?  Both? \n\nIf it's the latter, it says very plainly that no drug or treatment has even shown promise to cure or even *treat* either disease for any appreciable amount of time.\n\nAt some point, you ARE throwing good money after bad.\n\nIt's entirely possible they may focus efforts on other diseases... Perhaps some that affect more Americans and are more treatable.\n\nIts extremely doubtful they're going to simply pocket the money that was going into neurological disorders. "
"I misread this, thinking this was r/upliftingnews and they were investing in Alzheimer's, not ending investment. \n\nFeels bad man :("
'The medication industry is all fucked to begin with. '
"My grandmother has Alzeheimer's, and its tragic. The toll it has taken on my mother as a caregiver is hard to watch.\n\nI was really hoping (perhaps selfishly) that this would be a solved problem by the time it could impact my mom's own health. Regardless of the politics around this, its sad to see that Pfizer is considering their current investments a dead-end. It makes me think I was being too optimistic that this is a solvable problem in my parent's lifetime..."

"#*A partial overview of Paul Manafort's past ~~crimes~~ career:*\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n***Washington, DC:***\n\n\n- **1976**: Delegate hunter for the President Ford Committee\n\n- **1978 - 1980**: Southern coordinator for Reagan's presidential campaign (and running-mate George H. W. Bush), deputy political director of RNC.\n\n- **1980**: Formed political lobbying firm Black, Manafort, [Roger] Stone, and Kelly; which was employed by Reagan's election campaign.\n\n- **1980 - 1981**: Personnel coordinator, Office of Executive Management, during the Reagan administration's transition period.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n\n***Black, Manafort, Stone, and Kelly:***\n\n\nThe lobbying firm created by Paul Manafort and Roger Stone used connections within the US government to generate military, political, and economic support for brutal dictators all over the world. In the mid-2000s, Transparency International released a list of the world's top kleptocrats - [three of the top four corrupt leaders were Manafort clients:](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/26/indonesia.philippines)\n\n\n> - Suharto (Indonesia, $15-35 billion)\n- Ferdinand Marcos (The Philippines, $5-10 billion) – **Manafort client**\n- Mobutu Sese Seko (Zaire, $5 billion) – **Manafort client**\n- Sani Abacha (Nigeria, $2-5 billion) – **Manafort client**\n\n\nManafort (and Roger Stone) have made their fortunes from this dirty money:\n\n>The well-connected Washington lobbying firm of Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly has seen dictators such as Somalia's Mohamed Siad Barre, the Philippines' late Ferdinand Marcos and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire vanish from its client list. **So Black, Manafort knows the value of a steadfast tyrant. In the case of Jonas Savimbi, the controversial Angolan rebel leader, it's $600,000 a year - plus expenses.**\n\n>Trouble is, between 1985 and 1992, Black, Manafort's cash cow may have indirectly been the U.S. Treasury.\n\n>**Up until 1992, Savimbi, whose UNITA guerrilla forces long battled the Soviet-allied Angolan government, received up to $60 million a year in U.S. aid.** Much of it took the form of guns, ammunition and other military supplies shipped by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) via Zaire (whose longtime military dictator, Mobutu, was a $1 million-per-year Black, Manafort client until December 1990).\n\n>**With most of his war supplies provided by the U.S., Savimbi was able to pay Black, Manafort some $5 million to lobby for U.S. aid, generate favorable U.S. media coverage and gin up political support in Washington.** With Black, Manafort's help, Savimbi has made at least five well-publicized trips to Washington, visiting President Reagan at the Oval Office, dining with former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and meeting with then-Vice President George Bush in 1988. [source](https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-13571831/on-the-town-with-jonas-savimbi)\n\n\n^ *This* is how Manafort and Stone got paid. Manafort's daughter put it best in a test message to her sister about their father:\n\n[“Don't fool yourself,” Andrea Manafort wrote. “That money we have is blood money.”](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/manaforts-ukrainian-blood-money-caused-qualms-hack-suggests-235473)\n\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n***The Torturer's Lobby***\n\nBlack, Manafort, Stone, and Kelly had no ethical boundaries in who they assisted.\n\nIn 1992,  the Center for Public Integrity released this report:\n\n[The Torturer's Lobby: How Human Rights-Abusing Nations Are Represented in Washington](https://cloudfront-files-1.publicintegrity.org/legacy_projects/pdf_reports/THETORTURERSLOBBY.pdf) [pdf link]\n\nManafort and Stone's lobbying firm appears throught the document.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n\n***Some of Manafort's past clients:***\n\n\n\n- **Ferdinand Marcos** - Authoritarian leader of the Philippines from 1965-1986. His regime was famous for its corruption and extreme brutality, and supported by the US government. In 1986 Marcos fled the Philippines with his stolen wealth and was granted asylum by the US government, where he lived the rest of his life in exile.\n\n\n- **Mobutu Sese Soko** - Military dictator of DRC / Zaire from 1965-1997. Seized power through military coup d'etat. *The* classic African dictator - deeply criminal but willing to be a US ally, Mobutu destroyed his country through nepotism and embezzlement. In 1997 Mobutu fled Zaire and lived the rest of his life in exile.\n\n\n- **Sani Abacha** - De facto President of Nigeria from 1993-1998. Seized power through military coup d'etat, for the ~5 years he and his family were in power they stole $5+ billion from the government.\n\n\n- **Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo** - President of Equatorial Guinea 1979-present. Seized power through military coup d'etat, currently the second longest-serving non-royal leader in the world. His government is effectively a legal dictatorship, and has been marked by corruption.\n\n\n- **Siad Barre** - President of Somalia 1969-1991. Seized power through coup d'etat. Regime characterized by widespread human rights abuses and authoritarian rule. In 1991 Barre fled Somalia and lived the rest of his life in exile.\n\n\n- **Viktor Yanukovych** - President of Ukraine 2010-2014. In 2014 Yanukovych fled Ukraine; he is currently living in exile and wanted in Ukraine for treason.\n\n\n- **Donald Trump** - President of the United States 2017-present.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\n\n***Other scandals:***\n\n- **The Karachi Affair** - [(Timeline)](http://www.france24.com/en/20101118-karachi-bombing-pakistan-submarine-sales-timeline-france-sarkozy-villepin-chirac-justice-corruption-mediapart-luxembour) In 2002, 11 French engineers working in Pakistan were killed by a suicide bomber. They were there to assemble a fast-attack submarine purchased from France. The bombing was initially blamed on al Qaeda, but was later discovered to be financially motivated: the 1994 sale of French submarines to Pakistan had involved massive amounts of bribery, kickbacks, and illicit payments to both Pakistani and French middlemen. A confidential report by France's intelligence service found that a discontinuation of payments was the reason for the attack. [In 2013, Manafort admitted to being paid by middlemen in the arms sale.](http://www.france24.com/en/20130804-karachi-affair-karachigate-us-political-consultant-new-clues-balladur-france-pakistan) \n\n\n- **Employment by Pakistan's intelligence agency** - From 1990-1995, Manafort received $700,000 to lobby on behalf of the Kashmiri American Council (KAC) - a covert front organization for Pakistan's ISI: \n> The investigation unveiled an elaborate scheme on the part of the Pakistani government to influence Washington policymakers while hiding behind a seemingly innocuous nonprofit organization.

'The funniest part of the indictment is Manafort\'s company DMI has a "30 day email retention policy" to prevent investigators from obtaining emails...LOL does their email server have a 4 GB USB hard drive? No company would ever do that unless they were up to suspicious shit from the very start. '
"No wonder that Trump and GOP has been getting extra antsy about shutting down the investigation when they knew that there was collusion that could be proven so conclusively.\n\nIt's stupid how obvious they are."
"I don't want to rush to judgement, but I'm starting to think Manafort might not be the 'best people'."
"Manafort was already fucked. I want Stone or Don Jr. for fuck's sake."
"Seems pretty damning. Manafort is yet another disgusting animal exhibit in this shit zoo of an administration that is hell bent on destroying democracy.

"As Rachel Maddow said today Trump has to pardon Kilimnik  along with Manafort if he wants to end that part of the investigation.  So just as Rachel said a few days ago if Trump wants to pardon everyone to end this Russian investigation then he's going to have to pardon the Russians too.  Only an idiot with a death wish would do that, but Trump would be stupid enough to do that.  "

In the latest installment, the President of the United States personally funds a sting operation to discredit the Washington Post's reporting of Roy Moore's predatory pedophilia. And as it immediately unraveled, he's left exposed, paying for fake news. Because he's too stupid to understand that reporters have access to the internet. If only he could have killed the internet earlier, he'd have saved himself the embarrassment.  "
"This guy doesn't willingly donate to anything! Even the things he promises money to he welches on. There's no way he wasn't paying someone off for this scam. This is exactly the kind of poorly executed, poorly thought out, and frankly just plain stupid behavior we've come to expect from Trump. "

No longer do we depend on printed rags to form our opinions, and their overreaction to anything Trump does is a clear sign of desperation.'
'>“Racism is evil,” the US president said at the White House. “And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.”\n\nPlease show me where he is "nakedly sympathising with neo Nazis" in that statement?'
'He literally condemned Nazis and KKK by name, who is delusional enough to believe he is "sympathetic to neo-Nazis"? Just because he called out the violent alt-left communists that are just as evil too?'
"Well, now that the dumbass brigade has moved on from the Russian boogeyman (because they have nothing and never have) it's time to come up with something new:  Nazis.   \n\nMeanwhile, the criminally reckless and negligent officials of Charlotesville, namely the mayor and police chief, both likely guilty of multiple federal and state crimes, remain at large.  \n"
"There is too much prevaricating in this subreddit on what he actually said, even I as a non-white foreigner read the article and he did condemn the violence of the alt-right. He was justified in condemning both sides, they are not equivalent of each other but one can take a nuanced perspective and malign Nazis for their repugnant brand of violence whilst simultaneously denouncing violence that was reciprocate by the counter protesters. \n\nIt's humorous to me that activists are obfuscating what he is doing whilst claiming he is patently sympathising. The radical left and the alt right are irreconcilable political afflictions but it's in Britain's expediency to permit him to visit, a protesters moral indignation will not be appeased or satiated when the portent decline of Britain is imminent. \n\nIf things become too calamitous in the country, he will be greeted by more politicians because it's a pragmatic decision for the country to prosper. "
"The state visit will continue as planned.\n\nIf there's one thing that I've noticed a lot about the British culture is that they fear being inconsistent far more than they fear being wrong. I've grown tired of seeing how they brush aside any argument against them (mostly with stereotypical/feigned politeness). For an example, the recent general election and the subsequent back peddling on some of the policy announcements - fox hunting and cuts to school lunches are the two that instantly spring to mind."
'I hate trump but Jesus Christ that website is cancer on mobile.  '
'didnt donald straight up say he was disgusted by the nazis and WS at charlottesville? '
"According to Homeland Security, there are approximately 3K KKK and NAZI members in the United States.\n\nThe Venitian hotel in Vegas can fit 20K guests, so if you rounded them all up and put them in that hotel it wouldn't even be 1/6th full.\n\nYet Reddit wants to convince us we have NAZIs everywhere in America, supported by our President that has a Jewish daughter that he favors over his sons. *facepalm*\n\nGive it up already.   The 2017 McCarthyism was annoying enough; [listen to Obama's advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS2a44F5TgM).   Although speaking of Obama, does anyone recall his condemnation of the BLM murder of police officers?   Oh, he invited them to the white house afterward?   And how many times have other vehicle based terrorist attacks made it to the front of /r/politics when it didn't fit the agenda?   Interesting selective outrage.  "
'How? He condemned the violence in NC '
"He may still come, and they may wait for all this to die down before he does. Could be in afew months, or even afew years from now. Whenever he comes however, he will be greeted by some of the  most fierce protests for many years, all across the country.\n\nI can't express to Americans how much Trump is hated over here. The word Trump is absolute dirt, and if he's ever brought up in conversation its always to scathe his most recent abhorrent act. Everyone hates him, even the vast majority of Brexiteers who you may think would be more sympathetic, absolutely hate him. He is thought of as utter scum, and we hate seeing our cousins across the pond lead by such an incompetent, sick tool. "
'If he does go to the UK, he will be met with huge protests and I doubt the royal family will want to be seen with him. The optics would be so bad, a trip to the UK will do way more harm than good.'
"I'd rather we openly said 'you can't come because you're a massive twat and everyone hates you here' but I suppose you've gotta be a bit more subtle.\n\nPart of me wants him to come over just so he witness an entire country spewing hatred and bile at him wherever he goes."
"The 'State Visit' is never and was never going to happen... too many people are making a big deal out of a political gesture. Trump is a coward, he won't come to the UK because he knows he'll face protests and criticism from the media, general public & Members of Parliament he'd be visiting. \n\n"
"There is no such thing as alt left. There's decent humans and then there's douchebag nazis."
'Conservatives cried that Obama was letting Muslim terrorists into the White House; meanwhile, Trump has allowed Nazis into the White House.'
'I think world is again crossing that threshold where right wing nationalism is accepted thing.\n\nIt is happening in europe - But nowhere is it more concerning as in USA where president is openly sympathizing with nationalist movement.\n\nAnd the people that fought and died in WW2 are still with us ... brings me to tears'
"No, better idea. The UK lets him come but doesn't give him the time of day at all. No one to meet him at the runway, no official place to stay, no meetings with heads of state either planned or accepted. No protests by British citizens. The whole country acts like he isn't there. That'd drive his ego-fueled brain mad."
'Whew, the amount of nazi-sympathizers in here is fucking mind boggling. The man got mad because he was forced to say Nazi\'s are bad and had to come out again and yell about how good those people are and referred to them as "us"\n\nIf you choose not to see it, your worse then that asshole running people over in his car because you are only asking for more of it.

'The second worst real estate developer in the US giving national security advice to the worst real estate developer in the US. What could possibly go wrong?'
"Kushner is his own worst enemy.   How does one man have such terrible judgment that he finds himself in so many bad situations?  Real estate with 666 Fifth Ave... Check.  Making overtures to Russia for secret back door channels... Check.  Firing Comey... Check.  Marrying into Trump family... Check.  Lying to the senate investigative committee by not turning over all documents... check.  Omitting foreign contacts on his security clearance form... Check.  And I'm sure I left a few other major lapses of judgement by Jared out.\n\nMy advice to Jared is simple, whatever his initial reaction is to a situation, do the exact opposite because christ is he an idiot. "
"To make it clear, just because he was urged by Kushner doesn't absolve responsibility from Trump. He may be a codgerly grandpa, but incompetence and guillability are not defenses "
'"...the fool or the fool who follows him?"'
'Kushner reminds me of a cross between Pee Wee Herman, that Sheldon fuck from Big Bang Theory, Rain Man, and a pile of shit. '
"There's a lot of comments here about how stupid it was to get Comey fired.  But the thing is, what would you do if you knew you were just completely fucked?  If you've committed treason what's an obstruction charge matter?  There was a non zero chance that firing Comey could've at least delayed the inevitable so it wasn't completely ridiculous from a logic standpoint.\n\nI can't even imagine the stress."
"Of course he did. He's scrambling to avoid criminal charges despite being an obvious criminal. I no longer even react to these kinds of headlines, I'll wait until these jackasses are being criminally indicted."
'My favorite is when the former Benghazi howlers accuse us of being equally crazed when their nut-job witch hunt led to zero charges against Hillary after *years* of failed investigations.\n\nYou do realize Mueller is a real person conducting a real investigation, right? You do realize people have already been indicted, right? You do realize Papadap plead guilty, right?'
"Why is anyone listening to this guy? He made horrible real estate deals and the only reason why he is wealthy is his dad. This guy makes disastrous deals and he clearly isn't very smart"
'No shit, sherlock. Now how about someone does something about it.'
"Beady. Fucking. Eyes. I knew that shithead was evil the instant i saw him. He keeps a low profile in public, but he's doing all kinds of shit behind the scenes. I think he may be the most sinister of the Trumps."
'Welcome to whose crossing the line anyways...where everyone does illegal shit and the reports don’t matter. '
"Newsweek has literally one of the worst mobile sites ever.\n\nCan someone explain why Kushner wanted Trump to fire Comey? I don't see what the reason could be? "
'Right after the Manafort indictment, Vanity Fair reported that [Trump blamed Kushner for Mueller investigation](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/trump-west-wing-races-to-contain-mueller-fallout). I guess now we know why Trump was mad at Kushner. The dots are starting to connect...'
'How this administration is still in power is beyond me. This whole despicable lot are nothing but greedy, ignorant, racist, two-bit thieves. '
"How does this Kushner piece of shit still have a SC?  And his bimbo useless wife too?\n\nWhat a load of shit our government has become. And remember folks, there will be constant intrusions deliberately trying to get off topic, because it's the holiday season. Everyone,. Keep ya wits about you. We CAN get rid of these rats, but we've got to do it together. We must be UNITED!\n\nStay strong, and let's get rid of him, time to impeach, this scar on our democracy just keeps getting bigger.  This racist has got to be impeached. (Just heard the Don Ho remark from Twitter)\n\nThe shame I feel, knowing he's president. It's the worse shame I've ever felt. \n\nTime to get ready for work. I'm positive this will be the last year I can deduct my insurance payments. I'm in  *that*  class. And no kids or anything. Honestly, I'm glad there's less years in front of me than behind. \n\n*Getting off soapbox\n\nEdit......and I despise the Kushners more than anyone else, besides her daddy/groper.  I never knew that level of 'sense of entitlement' existed. Kush makes big decisions (Comey) and then *blames* others. Such a piece of shit. \n"
'Scared AND stupid'
"Although I believe they're all guilty I suspect everyone is trying to pin this on Jared."
"Isn't this bait and switch attempt? Saying it was all Kushner's idea and it was because he didn't like the way Comey handled the Clinton investigation and thought Dems would applaude it because they didn't like Comey investigating her? Isn't this an attempt to change the narrative to: Trump was *persuaded* to fire Comey by Kushner and it was only for the above reasons,  nothing to do with the Russia investigation? He was, in fact, acting on Kushner's advice and only because of a 'badly run' investigation into Clinton. "

'Not just the courts, but literally everything from executive orders to bills that come to his desk. "We need to figure out what the hell is going on"'
'While this is a popular idea here ("Trump/the White House should be paralyzed until the investigation is complete") I actually don\'t agree.\n\nShould Trump not be able to do stuff? Most likely.\n\n**But** does that mean we go "if an administration/sitting POTUS is under investigation, they shouldn\'t be able to do anything"? I say no. That gives **incredible** power to the FBI/whomever else is conducting the investigation and would literally paralyze 1/3 of the government for months/years at a time.\n\nNot saying it\'s the case here, but what if the investigation showed no wrongdoing? Did we put the cart before the horse? Punish someone for something they didn\'t do?\n\nIt\'s very easy to go "oh yeah Trump should be stopped!" but the implications of such a restriction goes beyond him.'
'"We lost the election and we should ignore the Constitution now because Drumpf is literally Hitler."\n\nSad!'
'This isn’t a popular opinion but I don’t think that’s what should happen. \n\nI hate that fucker with every fiber of my being but he won and Mueller may or may not uncover direct crimes by Trump. Until then it should function as normally as possible. \n\nIf any of those dipshits have ever seen one gangster film you never put the boss in the same room as the killer.'
'This is my problem with our current political situation: DEMOCRATS ARE TOO PATIENT.\n\nYou’d think they’d all be collectively kicking and screaming in the fight against the far right and their oligarchical aspirations. But no, our leaders feel they can sit and wait until Mueller makes his move meanwhile an entire system is working tirelessly to overtake our government.\n\nI know I may be off base, but I’m tired of playing the waiting game. Democrats have proven to be terrible long term strategists, and I’m just worried that before we can get Trump out of office the damage will already be done and the house, senate and judiciary branch will be republican owned for the next generation. \n\nWe need to be more vocal in calling out McConnell and his ilk on all of their BS. Otherwise we’re all screwed. '
"I wish more people would realize that the GOP will do NOTHING. This is exactly what all of them want, even starting a nasty war that kills a bunch of foreigners and liberals. They really really really don't care about you or what matters to you.\n\nThey will tear apart any democratic institutions that prevent them from doing what they want. They will support Trump as long as people keep shopping and acting like everything is normal."

'I\'m tired of all this "there should be this and there should be that". Its all circle jerk unless there legislation that starts to move forward. We just have to block everything the GOP does in the meanwhile.'
'Not a Trump fan. \n\nThat’s a really dangerous precedent to set. \n\nI get the spirit behind it, but that’s a disaster waiting to happen. '
'This is the dumbest shit ever. '

"Trump's mob ties killed the WSJ editorial."
'Trump is like a shit sandwich.  Depending on how you slice it you find something more disgusting than the previous slice.  two words - Roy Cohn.'
'To equate his dealings with organized crime in NYC with having "mob ties" is a bit of a joke. His dealings amounted to nothing more than simply hiring a company controlled by the mafia to do the concrete in his buildings. That is hardly a scandal, during that time period most, if not all developers in NYC had to do the exact same thing. They literally controlled the concrete industry at the time.'
'I have no idea if it\'s true or not, but I know most of reddit reads that title and thinks "omg, he must be in the mob!" Whereas, the simplest explanation is that if nobody is reporting that Trump is tied to the mob, and the one paper that started a piece on it killed the piece, maybe it\'s just not true?\n\nThis sub is ridiculous. If some rando media source said "Trump is orange because he\'s colluding with the Martians" you guys would eat it up like candy. Both sides really do exactly the same things, just that whoever\'s party isn\'t in power gets to feel like victims, which somehow excuses all the terrible behavior.'

'It’s amazing how his mob ties were never reported on extensively. I mean he’s a NYC developer and Atlantic City casino owner (and piece of shit human being)...of course he’s had dealings with the mafia. Ridiculous that the media dropped the ball on this, among everything else. Sickening'
"Anyone truly surprised?\n\nThe WSJ Op/Ed page is Fox News, the print edition.\n\nNo way in hell they'll criticize the Cheetos Führer unless he actually does shoot someone in the middle of 5th Avenue."
"If all of the decent journalists and editors at the Wall Street Journal left en mass and either started a competing newspaper or joined a more credible one without ties to Murdoch,  Rupert Murdoch's investment would collapse and the Wall Street Journal's propaganda would die on the vine.  These journalists would have no problem whatsoever in stealing WSJ's market share because many of us in the financial community thirst for objective business journalism that isn't corrupted by neoliberal stupidity and right wing extremists, like Rupert Murdoch and his editorial board stooges. "
'In a way, the world−view of the Party imposed itself most successfully on people incapable of understanding it. They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening.

"There seems to be a couple Running Theories here.\n\n1. This is to protect their assets. Once Mueller hit the Trump Organization, Don Jr. shit his pants.

Vanessa wasn't actually banging Dipshit Junior for his winning personality and devastating good looks. She wanted his money. Which she spent. Problem is that money has been laundered more times thank Trump Senior's hairpiece.\n\n3.It's completely Normal to hire a Criminal Defense Lawyer in a Divorce.

"I have mixed opinions on this. As a criminal defense lawyer, I get at least 2-3 calls a week from somebody wanting me to do a family law case. As I can't stand family law, nor is it anywhere near my specialty I send them on there way. I do know several people who are jacks of all trades who cover everything from first degree felonies to car accidents and family disputes. Typically they are decent at everything but not truly great at anything. Often times these lawyers cost a little less than somebody who does only family law.\n\nA divorce at this level is going to involve some very serious money. Which means that it seems unlikely that she would hire a jack of all trades lawyer. She has the money to hire the best family law attorney out there.\n\nWhich brings me to the conclusion that if she hired a criminal defense attorney it is because she anticipates criminal problems."

'Am I missing something or as of 9 am - has Trump not yet commented about the man who died from the fire in his building???'
'> "People feel safer with sprinklers," Trump said, according to the Times. "But the problem with the bill is that it doesn\'t address the buildings that need sprinklers the most.

"I work in a competing industry (fire and fire smoke dampers) so take this with a grain of salt.  Sprinklers are not some miracle system that'll kill any and all fires.  Aside from what some others have said about thier fire detection system, it's important to note that they are never tested after install.  It is literally impossible to do so.  Most codes require damper at install, and then testing once a year.\n\nThat being said, I'd imagine his stance was less about fire safety and more about money."
"I watched a great documentary on Netflix (the 4 part one) where they interviewed the people who worked on Trump tower (and his other business ventures). I was not surprised when the Project Manager of Trump tower said he would go as cheap as possible in the units - literally using nothing luxury just cheap press on tiles, etc. She was very proud of the structure, but how he did the inside was apparently pure shit. So it wouldn't surprise me if he tried to cut as many corners as possible especially if it means not trying to do things to a regulatory standard."
"Let's face it. Donald Trump is the worst human being alive today.\n\nHe has no redeeming quality about him to counter the fact that out every possible personality trait available, he has all of the worst ones.\n\nSo when you see an option after something has happened between doing the right thing and doing/wanting the wrong thing, you can rest assured Donald Trump always, *always* thinks about the latter."

'Sadly it just feels like another thing that would sink any other president, but we are so scandal fatigued at this point, its just another tick mark to add to the list. It feels like nothing he does is going to change anything, and we are all going to be left holding the shit show together when he skates off after fucking the country up. Its freaking depressing. '
"This is not at all surprising. It is Trump's *modus operandi*.\n\nI'd actually be **surprised** if he ***didn't*** interfere...\n\nas much as he possibly can, without leaving/producing clear evidence of a felony offense. He knows how far he can go... he's part of the system. He doesn't understand the concept of morals, and has some sort of completely narcissistic personality disorder. \n\n[edit] I wonder what med's he is on...\n\nI *amazes* me that our president is a real-life, bona fide Troll. Hmmm."
"Have you ever wondered if after all the work they're doing investigating trump's campaign and ties to Russia, when they get so close to getting it all figured out, organized, and put together, what if trump does something entirely unrelated and so much more stupid that he's kicked out before they can even pin him for the campaign stuff?"
"The sad truth is none of this is going to change for the foreseeable future because the Republicans have gerrymandered the states to get their candidates elected.  \n\nPeople who don't like Trump will complain about it but won't go out and vote because they didn't go out and vote to stop him from becoming President.  Voting for Congressional seats will bring out even less voters.\n\nHe won't be impeached because someone will take the fall for him. Just like Ollie North did for Reagan.\n\nThe Republicans are desperate for a win.  They were desperate enough to go with him even when he became the most toxic Presidential candidate in history because winning mattered more.  They defend him with everything they have because they can't afford to lose.  Democracy doesn't matter.  Free market doesn't matter.  Everything they have professed to believe in doesn't matter as long as they can stay in power.  Even child abuse is okay because they gotta have that seat.  Trump said it himself on National TV.\n\nThe people who voted him in will keep supporting him because they got taste of what it's like to have the government treat you like you don't matter, in other words, like a minority, and that shit scared and angered the hell out of them.\n\nMaybe in 2020, he might finally be voted out but the system will still be broken because we'll still have a two party system that puts the candidates up for vote that they want (Sorry, Bernie), and not the candidates that the people want.\n\nWe could change that by getting rid of the Electoral College and First Past the Post voting and for God's sake, getting lobbyists out of every part of our government.  We'll have no true Democracy as long as lobbyists exist.  We could change all of that but we won't because the people that have the will don't have the money and the people that have the money don't have the will.\n\nSo as much crap as we're going through we'll just have to bear it because no one is willing to make the sacrifices it will take for real change."

'A lot of hearings, investigations, and committees and still almost no one held accountable. I know things take time but this is really starting to look like a dog and pony show. WTF is Mueller? '
'Yo dawg, I heard you liked interference, so I put interference in your interference, so you can hate the administration while you hate the administration'
"Why are Democrats trying to ignore the Conyers scandal? For a sub that loves their virtue signaling, /r/politics is strangely quiet over the matter. \n\nDems tried to take the moral high ground against Moore; but once the skeletons in their own closet (Franken, Conyers, Clinton) started coming out, they're virtually silent with many in the media claiming Franken's and Conyer's rape allegations don't matter *as long as they continue to support good policy*.\n\nOver the last few weeks we've found that neither political party cares about sexual assault allegations and any attempts from Democrats to redefine their platform into stronger social support for sexual assault allegations and survivors completely went out the window when they backed these men.\n\nHypocrites and crooks. All of them.\n\n"

"Comment from the article:\n\n>This is an annoying and misleading headline and lede. I think the problem lies with the AP, not TPM, but TPM should not credulously repeat this stuff or amplify it with this kind of headline.\n\n>The 8.8 million figure is signups on the FEDERAL exchange. That's today's news. States had a choice of whether to set up their own exchanges or participate in this federal exchange. Most of the big blue states (California, New York, Massachusetts, Maryland, Washington, etc.) chose to build their own exchanges. Thus, it's not surprising that 80% of enrollees on the FEDERAL exchange are from red states -- those are most of the states on the federal exchange! Now, to be sure, it's not a perfect correlation. A bunch of blue states are on the federal exchange (Oregon, Michigan, and more) and a number of smaller red states went ahead and built their own (specifically, Idaho, Mississippi, and Utah). But by and large, most of the states on the federal exchange tend to be red states. So this 80% number is 100% due to that fact. When the enrollment periods end on the state exchanges, we'll get a fuller picture of where all the Obamacare individual plan enrollees are. It will not be 80% in Trump states.\n\n>Part of why I find this SO annoying is that while there is not a strong correlation between being in a Trump state and enrolling on the Obamacare exchange, there IS a stronger red-blue correlation between who would be eligible for the Medicaid expansion if states would expand Medicaid (there are lots more poor people in some of the Trump states, who would be eligible for Medicaid if their state chose to participate in the expansion). That is an important story. You can't see the important stories if journalists who don't understand health policy are putting out stories like this one."

He really is principled when it comes to torture, it’s not at all just talk. You would know that if you knew that he is in large part responsible for legislation banning the use of torture and has repeatedly in the past spoken out against his party when it comes to this issue, often standing alone. Even during the worst of the Bush years — what he just called one of the darkest chapters in American history — when you apparently weren’t allowed to be a patriot if you didn’t support waterboarding, he didn’t budge.

'Just as a reminder, here\'s what military interrogators, FBI interrogators, and CIA interrogators have to say about the effectiveness of torture.\n\n[**Military Interrogator Matthew Alexander**:](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/28/AR2008112802242.html)\n\n>I know the counter-argument well -- that we need the rough stuff for the truly hard cases, such as battle-hardened core leaders of al-Qaeda, not just run-of-the-mill Iraqi insurgents. But that\'s not always true: We turned several hard cases, including some foreign fighters, by using our new techniques. A few of them never abandoned the jihadist cause but still gave up critical information. One actually told me, "I thought you would torture me, and when you didn\'t, I decided that everything I was told about Americans was wrong. That\'s why I decided to cooperate."\n\n>Torture and abuse are against my moral fabric. The cliche still bears repeating: Such outrages are inconsistent with American principles. And then there\'s the pragmatic side: Torture and abuse cost American lives.\n\n>I learned in Iraq that the No. 1 reason foreign fighters flocked there to fight were the abuses carried out at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo. Our policy of torture was directly and swiftly recruiting fighters for al-Qaeda in Iraq. The large majority of suicide bombings in Iraq are still carried out by these foreigners. They are also involved in most of the attacks on U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq. It\'s no exaggeration to say that at least half of our losses and casualties in that country have come at the hands of foreigners who joined the fray because of our program of detainee abuse. The number of U.S. soldiers who have died because of our torture policy will never be definitively known, but it is fair to say that it is close to the number of lives lost on Sept. 11, 2001. How anyone can say that torture keeps Americans safe is beyond me -- unless you don\'t count American soldiers as Americans. \n\n[**Former FBI Special Agent John Cloonan**:](http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Cloonan%20Testimony%20061008.pdf)\n\n>It is my belief, based on a 27 year career as a Special Agent and interviews with hundreds of subjects in custodial settings, including members of al Qaeda, that the use of coercive interrogation techniques is not effective. The alternative approach, sometimes referred to as "rapport building" is more effective, efficient and reliable. Scientists, psychiatrists, psychologists, law enforcement and intelligence agents, all of whom have studied both approaches, have came to the same conclusion The CIA\'s own training manual \nadvises its agents that heavy-handed techniques can impair a subject\'s ability to accurately recall information and, at worst, produce apathy and complete withdrawal. [...]\n\n>Of course, obtaining reliable information from jihadist foot soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq is vital to protect our troops, who are in harm\'s way. But even on the battlefield and under exigent circumstances, rapport building is more effective in gaining information for force protection in my opinion. Enhanced and coercive interrogation techniques are ineffective even under extreme circumstances. I\'ve spoken to a number of FBI agent\'s who were seconded to Gitmo as interrogator\'s. In confidence, they told me the vast majority of detainees questioned under these stressful conditions were of little or no value as sources of useful intelligence. [...]\n\n>Gaining the cooperation of an al Qaeda member is a formidable task, but it is not impossible. I\'ve witnessed al Qaeda members, who pledged "bayat" to Bin Laden, cross the threshold and \ncooperate with the FBI because they were treated humanely, understood what due process was about and were literally seduced by our legal system, as strange as that might sound.\n\n[**Former FBI Agent Ali Soufan**:](http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/soufan_testimony_05_13_09.pdf)\n\n>The issue that I am here to discuss today - interrogation methods used to question terrorists - is not, and should not be, a partisan matter. We all share a commitment to using the best \ninterrogation method possible that serves our national security interests and fits squarely within the framework of our nation\'s principles.\n\n>From my experience - and I speak as someone who has personally interrogated many terrorists and elicited important actionable intelligence- I strongly believe that it is a mistake to use what has become known as the "enhanced interrogation techniques," a position shared by many professional operatives, including the CIA officers who were present at the initial phases of the Abu Zubaydah interrogation.\n\n>These techniques, from an operational perspective, are ineffective, slow and unreliable, and as a result harmful to our efforts to defeat al Qaeda. (This is aside from the important additional considerations that they are un-American and harmful to our reputation and cause.) [...]\n\n>The Army Field Manual is not about being nice or soft. It is a knowledge-based approach. It is about outwitting the detainee by using a combination of interpersonal, cognitive, and emotional \nstrategies to get the information needed. If done correctly it\'s an approach that works quickly and effectively because it outwits the detainee using a method that he is not trained, or able, to resist.\nThis Informed Interrogation Approach is in sharp contrast with the harsh interrogation approach introduced by outside contractors and forced upon CIA officials to use. [...]\n\n>In summary, the Informed Interrogation Approach outlined in the Army Field Manual is the most effective, reliable, and speedy approach we have for interrogating terrorists. It is legal and has \nworked time and again. It was a mistake to abandon it in favor of harsh interrogation methods that are harmful, shameful, slower, unreliable, ineffective, and play directly into the enemy\'s handbook. \n\n>It was a mistake to abandon an approach that was working and naively replace it with an untested method. It was a mistake to abandon an approach that is based on the cumulative wisdom and successful tradition of our military, intelligence, and law enforcement community, in favor of techniques advocated \nby contractors with no relevant experience. \n\n>The mistake was so costly precisely because the situation was, and remains, too risky to allow someone to experiment with amateurish, Hollywood style interrogation methods- that in reality- \ntaints sources, risks outcomes, ignores the end game, and diminishes our moral high ground in a battle that is impossible to win without first capturing the hearts and minds around the world. It was one of the worst and most harmful decisions made in our efforts against al Qaeda.\n\n[**Former CIA Interrogator Glenn Carle**:](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/us/politics/04torture.html?_r=0)\n\n>[coercive techniques] “didn’t provide useful, meaningful, trustworthy information.”\n\n[**Former interrogators Matthew Alexander (who I mentioned earlier), U.S. Army intelligence officer Col. (Ret.) Stuart Herrington, former FBI special agent Joe Navarro, and military intelligence veteran Ken Robinson**](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-danzig/torture-did-not-lead-the-_b_857708.html) (in response to claims that the use of torture led to the capture of Osama bin Laden by U.S. forces):\n\n>Torture Did Not Lead the U.S. to bin Laden, It Almost Certainly Prolonged the Hunt.\n\n>The use of waterboarding and other so-called "enhanced" interrogation techniques almost certainly prolonged the hunt for Bin Laden and complicated the jobs of professional U.S. interrogators who were trying to develop useful information from unwilling sources like Khalid Sheik Muhammed.\n\n>Reports say that Khalid Sheik Muhammed and Abu Faraq al-Libi did not divulge the nom de guerre of a courier during torture, but rather several months later, when they were questioned by interrogators who did not use abusive techniques.\n\n>This is not surprising. Our experience is that torture is a poor way to develop useful, accurate information.\n\n>We know from experience that it is very difficult to elicit information from a detainee who has been abused. The abuse often only strengthens their resolve and makes it that much harder for an interrogator to find a way to elicit useful information. \n\n\nThese aren\'t academics musing on ethics from the safety of their own country. They\'re not politicians trying to win votes. These are (or were) professional interrogators just trying to do their jobs in the most effective way possible. The ethical grounds aren\'t being discounted by any means but in an "it\'s them or us" situation, ethics too often get left by the wayside. That\'s why it\'s important to educate people of the most effective interrogation techniques.\n\nIt might be easier to just torture suspects and hope for the best but the easiest way isn\'t always the most effective way. Fast, reliable information requires out-thinking terror suspects. The fact that it\'s also morally ethical and doesn\'t rally thousands of recruits to our enemies\' cause is an added bonus.'

"When you turn contacting the families of dead soldiers into a pissing contest, you're no longer just a liar. You're an irredeemable asshole. "
"My Dad and Step-Mom lived next door to the mother of a special forces solider who was fighting in Iraq. My step-mom was friendly with her, and knew about her son's military career.\n\nIn 2005, my step-mom was doing some work in the yard when two black cars pulled up. A bunch of military officers got out and went into the neighbors house. Her son had been severely injured the previous day, during a helicopter operation in Anbar Province, Iraq, and he died shortly after being airlifted to a military hospital.\nThis mother lost her only son, and was absolutely devastated. She was angry too, at her son's commander, and at the military, for putting him in harms way.\n\nThe very next day, President George W. Bush called her on the phone. She told my step mom he spoke to her for at least 15-20 minutes. He was humble, apologetic and sorrowful, and obviously had been briefed on her son's mission, his personality and his passions. President Bush spoke about his own turmoil in leaving soldiers to fight in Iraq, and about his love for his daughters. When looking back a year or so later, the neighbor said that this call really and seriously help her grieve for her son with more peace in her heart and very little anger.\n\nGW Bush was a pretty terrible president, by most standards, but he was a human with compassion and sympathy.\n\nOur current president is a liar, a narcissist and an aspiring fascist. He is a monster."
'We all would like the president to stop the lying. But he won’t – because he’s done it so long, he can’t tell the difference between lies and truth.'
'I now suspect that Donald lies so much because his own brain lies to him.  He\'s so delusional that he probably lives in his own version of reality.  All these facts that he gets wrong are actually how he sees things in this warped reality of his.\n\n"Someone told him" that President Obama didn\'t call the families of slain soldiers.  Just like "someone told him" that the GOP\'s healthcare bill would be great and wouldn\'t do things like strip pre-existing condition protections.  Or how "someone told him" that his electoral college win was the biggest landslide since Reagan.  Or how "someone told him" to ignore all the historically bad polls, because everything he\'s doing is really popular with everybody.  \n\nIn his head, Donald probably has an imaginary aide named Buddy McWhiteHouse that tells him all this wrong information, which Donald then blurts out to the press, government officials, and the public.\n\nHe keeps talking about fake news, but I bet his brain has been supplying him with fake news for years.'
'People need to do this more.   Call out **lies** for what they are, loudly and vociferously.   No more of this "he must have misspoken" or "Could you  clarify?" bullshit.   Call **lies** fucking **lies**.  Call them when they happen and don\'t stop until Trump acknowledges that he lied or retreats like the fucking pig-coward that he is.'
"Half of America wants to be lied to.\n\nThey want somebody to tell them that their unhappiness is somebody else's fault."
'my fiancee has a 2 pictures of her. one with bush and another with obama because they came to visit her bedside after she was hurt. so what the fuck is he even talking about?'
"Lying is his life. He's not going to stop. He doesn't think he's doing anything wrong. Trump has been insulated in bubble wrap for 70 years. How embarrassing."
'Our current president is a master at employing a wide variety of psychological tactics to claim infallibility and dodge accountability no matter what statements he makes. For example, during a press conference yesterday our president was asked whether he called the families of those recently killed in action overseas. This was his response:\n\n"If you look at President Obama and other presidents, most of them didn\'t make calls—a lot of them didn\'t make calls."\n\nThe president made two (and potentially three) overlapping claims, all vague yet able to be tested with research:\n\nClaim 1: Most presidents in the past didn\'t call the families of soldiers killed in battle.\n\nClaim 2: President Obama is included in the subset of \'most\' or \'a lot\' of presidents who didn\'t call the families of soldiers killed in battle; or\n\nClaim 3: President Obama is included in the list of \'other presidents,\' but not the subset of the \'most\' or \'a lot\' of presidents who didn\'t call the families of soldiers killed in battle.\n\nFor starters, Claim 1 is dubious because the president gave no explanation as to how he arrived at the conclusion that \'most\' or \'a lot\' of previous presidents didn\'t call the families of soldiers killed in battle. How does he define \'most\' and \'a lot\'? Is it a simple majority? More than two-thirds? In addition, when he talks about previous presidents, how far back is he going - to the advent of the telephone? The last century? The last few decades? Finally, what data is he using as evidence for this claim? What research has shown this claim to be true?\n\nIf the public responds by saying that President Obama did, in fact, call the families of soldiers killed in battle (and the public did indeed respond this way, because Obama did, indeed, call the families of those killed in battle), our president can say, "Well, I didn\'t specifically say Obama didn\'t call families; I was just including him in the list of previous presidents." Or, the president can choose to \'move the goalposts\' - something he\'s a master of doing. \'Moving the goalposts\' is a spurious debate tactic wherein a claim is made and then the threshold of truth for that claim is altered ex post facto to create the impression that the initial claim was correct. During an interview on Fox News Radio today, our president moved the goalposts by facetiously saying, "You could ask General Kelly, did he get a call from Obama?" This claim is supposed to imply that Obama didn\'t call General John Kelly when his son was killed in action in Afghanistan in 2010, thus supporting the claim that Obama didn\'t call the families of every soldier killed in battle...but remember: his initial claim wasn\'t that Obama didn\'t call every family; his initial claim was that Obama simply didn\'t make those calls.\n\nThe president\'s goalpost-moving claim accomplishes two objectives:\n\n1) It gives the impression that the president\'s initial claim that \'President Obama didn\'t call the families of fallen soldiers\' was somewhat or completely true;\n\n2) It moves the spotlight off the president. No longer is the media holding the current president accountable for not calling the families of soldiers killed in action and subsequently deceiving the public about that fact; they\'re reporting on the blowback itself and the responses to it.\n\nWhether you\'re pro-life or pro-choice, in favor of tax increases or tax cuts, or want international diplomacy through force or negotiation, you should agree on one thing: the psychological manipulation used by our current president is fucking. tiring.'
"The narcisissm, instability, idiocy, and general unfitness for office aside, I think his worst quality is all the repeated, constant personal attacks he's lobbing at his predecessor, by name. Has any other President in US history stooped to such a level?"
'The part that bothers me is "When he was pressed on it, he said someone told him."\n\nHe uses this as a fucking excuse to say whatever the fuck he wants. What\'s next? "I heard the Jews are raping families by the millions, they need to be stopped"'
'What we **need** is to form a united front, and *every single time* the orange sack of shit is caught lying, follow up exactly like Holder did:  STOP THE DAMN LYING.  \n\nI feel like sane people right now are still holding back, trying to be polite or something.  We\'re being kept spinning by all the utter nonsense spewing out of that little butthole-esque mouth, and having to pick and choose what shit we focus on and get outraged over.  I think we all just need to adopt a solid front, and no matter what is coming out of his mouth, since we know it\'s probably 95% chance of being a lie, reply with the simple phrase: STOP THE DAMN LYING.  \n\nTweet it, post it on FB, send emails to the White House (won\'t do anything, but it *does* feel good), print it on a goddam shirt.  The press needs to get on board.  Stop with this "false facts" bullshit.  Call him out, cite the proof of his lie, and firmly, clearly, LOUDLY, say: **STOP THE DAMN LYING!!!!!!!!!!!**'
"Stop the damn lying. Except, he cannot. He is a con man, a scam artist. That's how he took big deposits/down payments on luxury condos, then let the projects go into bankruptcies that cheated the people who paid and the contractors who built part before the bankruptcy, without it touching him or his profits. That how he got aspiring real estate students to pay tuition to his fake university. He claimed every faculty member was personally selected and approved by him. But under oath in depositions, he had to admit he knew *none* of the faculty, had never even met one.\n\nThat's how he got elected president."
"It doesn't matter. The Trump sycophants will believe whatever he says. If you call trump out for lying, they'll call you a cuckyface, a libbietard or a poopyhead. They'll use an alcoholics instagram as proof while dismissing out of hand Kissinger. Remember, they believe there is a massive sex slave ring at pizza shops in America. Even though there is no proof. They hate McCain and Bush and any republican who doesn't bu into their dogma."
"President Trump should just be referred to as President Piece of Shit for all his lying. Tell me PPOS doesn't have a nice ring to it."
'I\'m honestly starting to believe Trump isn\'t lying so much as repeating lies he saw on Fox News. Trump *is* the angry grandpa that watches Fox News. That is where he gets his info from. I believe that Trump believes the things he says. But I don\'t know which of those two options is scarier, because there is going to be a day where Fox and Friends spends 30 minutes yelling "just nuke the damn North Koreans" and Trump might actually do it.'
"Trump's a liar. Republicans don't care. Pope shits in woods. Bears cute but deadly. Parking a bitch downtown."
'Stop the damn lying. - Summary of Trump administration '
"Compare this to Bush the Younger. He would go and meet with the families of the fallen and they would scream their lungs out at him. They would yell and call him names and accuse him of murder and he would stand there in silence and take it. He wouldnt interrupt them, wouldn't make it about him. He didnt go on TV or social media and insult them. And when they we're about to collapse into a ball of tears and exhaustion he held them up. Say what you want about W but when it came to the families he met their grief and fury head on. "
"His instinct was to dis Obama because of his supporters racism, his racism, and his ego.  When it turned out it was a piece of shit comment, his supporters give him a pass because 'well, it sounds true.'"
'More politicians need to start calling out his god damn lies, with the most direct language possible. Cut that polite euphemisms. Straight up, "stop the damn lying".'
"In 2010 the year General Kelly's son was killed there were approximate 556 US troop deaths. A US soldier was getting killed in Afghanistan every 18 hours. While Obama may not have personally called, Kelly did receive a letter from the president and was invited to sit with the Obama's for an event with Gold Star families. Since trump has taken office we have lost 8 US soldiers. There is simply no excuse for him to not have reached out to the families. He has found the time to attack the NFL, campaign for a losing candidate, not pass any significant legislation, and PLENTY of time for twitter.\n\nThe sick part is that he is using the death of his Chief of Staff son to save face from another idiotic comment and pathetically attack two former presidents who have not said anything about trump since he was elected. trump is mentally unfit for office. \n\nIt is also amusing how quickly trump supporters get their talking points after every trump failure and spread it across the internet. It is remarkable on a number of levels. "
'How can someone who was too chicken shit to fight for his country, not because he was a conscientious objector, or because of religious believes, just a plain old fashion lying chicken shit get away with this kind of behavior? '
'We all would like the president to stop the lying. But he won’t – because he’s done it so long, he can’t tell the difference between lies and truth.'
"I'm seriously wondering what the limit is going to be? So far this man has been able to overcome every piece of negative reporting on his behalf. I can't see any other person overcome what he did. Just by acting the way he does, the lying and not giving a f about being caught...it's dangerous. He's living in his own unstable world.\n\nAnd it's not like he has someone who can go against him and actually achieve something. If it's someone who works for him, he fires them. If it's a reporter, it's fake news, if it's some other official like the major of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he'll just fabricate some more lies. I hope he doesn't get a second term..but to be honest, my faith in the American voters isn't at its highest right now"
'This is what happens when you knowingly allow a rapist to run the country.'
"There are a lot of people aside from Obama that put in a lot of hard work over 8 years. I can't even imagine what would be going through their minds as they watch Trumo undue 8 years of their lives for no more than greedy and callous reasons. I would imagine many of them do not have the ice cold chill of obama's personality. We can read their proposals and these people are doing everything they can to ensure that their future is amazing while ours is some post apocalyptic hell. "
"Ugh, Trump is a disgusting pig. Every day there's some new dumb thing he says. All while his supporters become more rabid in their devotion, and refuse to acknowledge his lies, his mistakes, or his outright incompetence.\n\nOh, and I'm a conservative. I probably hate Trump more than most liberals on this page.\n"
'So Trump is turning HIM not calling the families of dead soldiers into an attack on Obama??'

'Fuck these un-American pieces of shit'
'They\'re intentionally lying on a technicality. Trump said "shithouse" not shithole. \n\nTheir denial is willfully designed to give the impression that he didn\'t say anything offensive at all. The truth is "shithouse" is just as bad as "shithole" and is not *a gross misrepresentation* as they claimed. '
'All Republicans are "Trump Republicans" now.  Let none of them escape accountability for foisting this historic curse onto the world.'
'Pieces of shit should resign.  '
"I don't mean to be contrary but according to this article, I see three people saying he didn't say it and one saying he did. I have no doubt about Durbin's veracity, but based on this article that haven't provided irrefutable proof that he's correct.\n\nI point this out because we criticize FoxNews for not providing evidence for statements so I expect a higher level of reporting. "
"This country fucking sucks. Fuck the corrupt lawmakers that claim they're working to make life better for every day people, they are worthless lying wastes of space. "
'Brown nose flunkies, liars for hire exposed '
'Lying to congress will get you impeached or jailed. Congressmen lying to each other and the american public is ok?'
">\tThree White House officials said Perdue and Cotton told the White House that they heard “shithouse” rather than “shithole,” allowing them to deny the president’s comments on television over the weekend. The two men initially said publicly that they could not recall what the president said.\n>\t\n>\tNot only did these two repeatedly lie, but Cotton also impugned the integrity of Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), who told the truth. Asked whether the accusation that Trump spoke the offending words or the sentiment was phony, Cotton lied, “Yes.”\n\nAmazing. These people have no shame, and the White House clearly isn't even going to back them up when they lie for the president."
'Okay, can someone help clue me in here? (Preface: I\'m not a Trump supporter)\n\nFirst off, the media has been saying Trump said "racist remarks," but saying *a country* is a shithole isn\'t the same thing as saying *the people* in said country are shitholes, yes? Inappropriate, yeah, but not exactly racist. Or has he said other things that I missed in this incident?\n\nSecondly, wasn\'t this a private meeting? Correct me if I\'m wrong. Again, what he said was inappropriate, but shouldn\'t we allow some level of privacy for internal meetings? At my work, for example, we\'ll sometimes casually swear amongst each other in meetings, but we\'d never use such language if the public was scrutinizing. If I went and started calling my coworkers out in public for casual speech said in internal meetings, I don\'t think that\'s very fair...'
'It amazes me that Trump has any sincere supporters. He is easily the shittiest public figure in America today. WTF, America?

'We can’t trust them. They need to resign immediately. If Franken left over a possible air-honk on boobs, these fucks need to go for lying to Americans about something that matters. I say that as someone with boobs. '
"What I really don't understand is, where is the accountability for these people. For the last year we have been enveloped by unethical behavior in the news from this administration. It seems, at least from my leftist viewing, that everyone is asking for some sort of rebuke towards Trump and his peeps. Just a rebuke. A promise that these actions won't continue. Yet they perpetually do. What gives? Where is the ethics committee in This? Don't they have any power here? Where's someone to really hold these guys accountable.\n\nIt seems no where.\n\nSo they know they can get away with it with no repercussions. There exist nothing to tarnish their political career \n\nWhy are there no consequences for anything in this administration?\n\nSomeone please explain."
'"We don\'t want them forign liars in America, lyin\' about being legal while working 12+ hour a day jobs for little money. This is America, land for American liars."\n\n\n/S because I worry now.'
'Unfortunately as it is, Trump is only the tip of the iceberg. There is a veritable army of shills, traitors and serial liars who support and cover his back. In order to really purge our government of treasonous, two faced fucks we need to remove every person who collaborates with and protects trump as well'
'Fuck Tom Cotton, Fuck David Perdue, Fuck Donald Trump and Fuck the entire GOP!'
"The thing I don't get is, how stupid are these guys to think people won't see through this?\n\nDo they honestly think they'll do an interview, lie, then that's the end of it? Do they not realize their asshole president is drawing so much attention he can't *fart* without the media knowing what he ate the night before? And that, consequentially, anyone who lies for him will suffer the same scrutiny?"
"I'm cackling at all the folks trying to make a distinction between a shit hole and a shit house. either way, it's either a hole full of shit or a house full of shit, and in this context, neither is complementary.\n\nAlso, President Shithouse and his apologists must think we are all stupid. \n\n"
"An a UK citizen reading about this shit was funny, then shocking, then irritating, now it's just confusing. \nAt what point does Trump get impeached. I mean how many fucking White House scandals are actually needed? \nI mean it seems like you guys are just waiting for a clean bakers dozen. Or maybe have that thermometer like churchyard fundraising with the top saying IMPEACHMENT. \nYour own laws are stopping you from ejecting the worst President in the history of your country, who calls real news fake news, creates lies to mask the truth and worst of all it actively trying to fuck over the American people. AND YOU KNOW IT!!!"

"Given the case law created around Clinton, I don't think they are going to avoid it. Plus, trying to do so, is going to make Trump look even more guilty of having committed a crime. "
"If they *just now* started researching precedent then Trump really does have the worst fucking lawyers.\n\nWe've known where Mueller's investigation would end since last June. These guys are so bad at their jobs."
'Please, Trump supporters. Explains this to us. You have been screaming and crying that Hillary provided testimony but was not under oath (which doesn’t matter as lying would still constitute a crime regardless), but Stable Genius and his lawyer’s are trying to avoid it all together?\n\nBetter yet, don’t bother.

"Real question here: has anyone in the media started to have the discussion about what's going to happen when this is all over?

How will this shake out. \n\nAnd is anyone going to address the fact he WILL become a martyr to his base. And that base will be PISSED and ready to raise holy hell. "
"> “You fight back, oh, it’s obstruction,” Trump mockingly told reporters.\n\nIf you fight an investigation into Russia's involvement in the US election, you fight for Russia and against America."
"Anyone who thinks Trump will ever step foot in front of Mueller are goddamned delusional. Everyone knows he's guilty so there's nothing for for him to gain and everything to lose from doing it. He has repeatedly shown he doesn't give two shits for the rule of law and he believes he's above all of it and he will do everything in his power to avoid it up to firing Mueller and purging the FBI. And of course Congress won't do shit, again anyone who believes they will are also delusional. The groundwork has already been put in place and his base laps that shit up. There's been zero actual effort to even begin to counter the incredibly sophisticated attack still ongoing from Russia.  \n\n~~Time to wake up sheeple~~ If sweeping changes aren't made in the next congressional election Trump may become President for Life..and his base will cheer.\n\nScary times indeed.\n\nAnd anyone who wants to argue? We have an admitted rapist, openly racist, alleged child molester, money laundering buffoon with zero experience who has literally lied thousands of times and has repeatedly and unquestionably profited from his Presidency all while doing his best to sabotage HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION in order to derail an investigation that includes a foriegn attack upon our nation...and he's in the driver's seat of our democracy. \n\nI fear for my children and any person who doesn't have a dick, wealth and white skin.\n\n*Edited to strikethrough my sheeple comment. I didn't want to delete it outright however I can see how it could come off as me being a dick, my apologies*\n\n\n"
"How pathetic. The compulsive liar is admitting he cannot even try to tell the truth. And if he tells the truth, he's fucked. "
'Why? If you’re innocent the you have nothing to hide.  \n\nThe fucking hypocrites on the Wrong believe that they have the right to take your privacy because “you should have nothing to hide.”  Lets ruin them.   Lets hold their feet to the fire until they burn, scald them on the same blame they used to take our rights repeatedly.  Only when we take them to the hot iron will they realize how Wrong they are.'
"Well no shit. This was predicted by pretty much everyone. He said he would speak with Mueller just to get the attention on that, convincing his loyal(brainwashed) followers that he was innocent and could answer anything Mueller threw at him. \n\nBut anyone with an actual brain(Those who didn't vote for Trump) would realize it was just a publicity stunt, to try to distract from how shitty and corrupt he is. He wanted to appear like there was nothing wrong. \n\nBut his intention was clear from the beginning. He would never ever want to meet with Mueller. Because he is guilty. And now he will blame his lawyers as the reason he won't meet with him. \n\nBeing an American, having Trump as our President, makes me hate being an American more than anything else. It used to be a kind of good thing to be an American. \n\nNow, under Trump, it's an embarrassment to admit you are an American. \n\nFuck this guy and all that he stands for. And fuck all of his racist, freedom hating supporters he has. \n\n"
"I don't know why they wouldn't just let Mr. Diarrhea-of-the-Mouth talk to Mueller. After all the was NO COLLISION and NO OBSTRUCTION. \n\nIf he interviews, the result will be a YouTube video that we will be watching the rest of our lives."
"It's official: Trump is too stupid and too guilty to face Mueller without incriminating himself.     \n\nWhat a prick. "
'Mueller’s just going to charge him anyways.\n\nThe man has enough to charge Trump with a multitude of things. That only thing he’s missing is a charge of lying to the FBI.'

It’s getting so much attention and maybe there is something to the “hush money” or what have you. I have far greater concerns with his appointment of Bolton and trade war he’s waging.

"I'm tired of these posts getting so many upvotes. So some democratic politician introduces a symbolic bill. It is symbolic because no Republican will vote for such a bill so it is a waste of everyone's time. \n\nThere will be no mental health evaluation, just as there will never be an impeachment."
"I'm surprised I haven't seen it commented on during the Trump 'losing it' press exchange. In one piece of hearty banter with the press Trump lost his cool and started berating the reporter until his voice went into that whiny 6 yo no reason or logic  tantrum for half a word before he caught himself. He is losing it and he knows it. He is scared like that tough guy muscle man neo nazi when confronted with the consequences of their illegal deeds they turn into bluthering needy pathetic creatures.\n "

"
"I'm not a Trump supporter by any means but the implication that he has a mental disorder is just ridiculous. It really makes the opposition look like they're grasping at straws. For something to be a mental _disorder_ it has to impair function. Even though his views are very unpopular this man managed to become the president of the United States. His functioning is nowhere near impaired.\n\nEdit: Also it's insulting to people that actually have mental disorders. They are awful debilitating illnesses that shouldn't just be thrown around as political insults or as a means to explain the actions of bad people."
'No. No. No. No need for assessment. Off the throne for him!!! Now.\nWhat you say? More assessment? Moderation? No. He is fired. Now!'
"I'm not sure how serious she is, but this feels a bit ominous. Totalitarian states often use...er...trumped-up accusations of mental incompetency to remove their opponents. I agree that Trump is a nutter, but he was a nutter before he got elected, and people voted for him anyway. "
"He'd fail and he won't accept help even if he knows he needs it. He's a coward at heart that can't deal with even the smallest adversity let alone his own failure to mature."
"It is odd that we have a bit of evidence of dementia. But you'd think it's taboo to suggest the president has a mental disorder. One that his father before him had."
'I can see this being abused badly in the far future.'
"To what end? Do they really think Trump supporters will accept any results if this actually passed? I want Trump gone as much as the next person, but this is an exercise in futility. It also opens a Pandora's Box of problems for the future. Any precedent set would allow future leaders to continuously have their power challenged if they lost popularity.\n\nThis is a severely short sighted bill and is a waste of time and energy."

I am mortified by the Supremacist In Chief.  To all non Americans, I apologize for this incompetent racist moron\'s words.  He does NOT reflect my views or values.

I feel horrible for the people who believed his empty rhetoric and have come to realize he was duping them.  \n\nI\'m surprised more of his ex supporters haven\'t sing the rallying cry for his removal from office.

'This morning I thought Trump was having a bad day because the tweeted about Hillary Clinton right after Kellyanne Conway said he never talks about Hillary Clinton, and then he completely contradicted the Republican party’s position on FISA after watching a Fox & Friends segment and had to send a “hahah just kidding guys” tweet about 2 hours later.\n\nNow he goes and does this... now he’s having a REALLY shitty day.'
"Trump is a bad person and if you support him, you're a bad person. Doesn't matter if it's from ignorance, prejudice or blind party loyalty. "
"The President of the United States is blatantly racist, and people all across the country are defending him and approving of his statements. The GOP won't stop him.

They have the right to their beliefs but we also have the right to stand up and let the majority know , that silence and complacency on this subject is criminal .  Speak up and speak enough so this never becomes normal . '
'Trump is racist AF'
'Honest question — wouldn’t this be ethnocentrism more so than racism (maybe ethnocentrism also has racist undertones)? I ask this because the words Trump used call the countries shitholes, not the people, which seems to imply he believes that we should be allowing immigration from first world countries instead of 3rd world (I know those terms are their own rabbit hole and stemmed from ethnocentric views of the US). I worry we are losing important nuances when discussing racism and just applying the word as a blanket term. '
"Not only that, but what about the kids?\n\nI never thought I'd be the one saying this, but what a vile role model holding and desecrating the decorum of our highest office."
"And still nothing will happen since the Republicans don't care. That's the real problem here. That Trump is a racist idiot is well known for decades. The scandal is\n\n a) he was voted by half of the United States to become their president\n\n b) that Republicans still support him even after all these new scandals. \n\n\nUSA has become a self-service store without a cashier for the rich and people only talk about the racist orange bouncer in the front."

'lets not kid ourselves, trump is a racist'
'As usual with Trump, his statement was not well thought out for the backlash that was guaranteed to follow. It could have and should have been worded much better. With that said - the statement he made is truthful. These countries he’s referring to lack most modern amenities and infrastructure. Maybe I’m missing part of it but i don’t see why this is being taken as racist? \n\nThere are countries that  have Immigration  laws in place that are similar to what Trump believes in and not once have I seen anyone protesting them.

So explain to me if you really care about those issues how you’re not demanding better from Trump.\n\nI get it, you’re not going to openly suddenly be against Trump after all this, but how are you OK with this? How is this kind of news good news for you? As the 30% to 40% of Americans that Trump actually cares about and wants to be President of, you have the most power to make him do better, he actually listens to you, he’ll do what what you say. At least say *something* about how you’d like to see better. \n\nI mean this is not okay, what he’s doing. Do us liberals piss you off that much? I can guarantee you we have more in common than either one of us feel we want to admit, but it’s true.

They didn\'t say that Broidy isn\'t responsible for Nader\'s actions.\nNader is the canary in this selfish, treasonous, collapsing coal mine. \n\nThis also explains the blockade on Qatar from last year.

"Trump has always stood for what is wrong with America. He is an opportunistic piece of shit, feeding off of America's perceived fears.\n"
'The most infuriating scene is one where we get to see soldiers forced to salute President PeeTUS'
'He is weakening America’s defences so that when Russia makes its move America will be weakened. We see it with the English conservatives. They purposefully weaken public services like the national health service so then private companies can swoop in. '
"Wait a second, Trump said that the spurs healed up over time?  I'm no medical expert, but I do have a few bone spurs, and my understanding is that they don't ever really heal.  In fact, they're generally caused by your body failing to send the cue for your bones to stop healing.  Am I missing something here?"
"Trump deserves all the criticism in the world for using bone spurs as an excuse, but I'm glad he didn't go to Vietnam. The likelyhood he'd have gotten someone killed is pretty high.\n\nThose rich kids either had shadows to keep them out of danger or they got put somewhere out of combat. In the former situation I can see dumbass Trump trying to go golfing in a minefield while the poor sap assigned to protect him died keeping him alive."

I'm concerned Trump's getting closer to pulling the trigger.  He's in full fledged panic mode. \n\n\n"
"Here's a thing:\n\nWhen the time comes and Trump wants to go to war with North Korea, or fire missiles at him, just say no. For the good of the country just don't listen to him.\n\nMake it a coup. We don't care at this point cause we want him gone."
'For any red hats here, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Forces_Korea) states there are over 35K US troops in Seoul alone. If we invade North Korea, there\'s a material chance that a big portion of them could be wounded or killed very soon thereafter. Also, invading North Korea without the consent from the South would greatly hurt our international relationships. \n\nYou can say "fuck the world" all you want, but **at least know what you\'re enabling, how that can hurt you/family/friends, and be honest with yourself if the consequences would be worth it to you.**'
'>\nBoth\xa0the Daily Telegraph\xa0and the\xa0Wall Street Journal\xa0have reported on the divided White House, with both publications portraying Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis as trying to caution President Donald Trump against the strike, while National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster advocates in favor.\n\nWhen the man with the nickname "mad dog" is cautioning restraint you really have to worry about the rest.  I wonder how McMaster is going to lay these bodies at feet of LBJ too? '
'"Don\'t worry North Korea will just nuke one of the population centers, and they are just Democrats.. very bad people, didn\'t vote for me.. so who cares"\n\n - Trump probably.'
'Make no mistake, as the noose tightens around Trump, he will have NO problem doing ANYTHING he can to distract from this--*including launching nuclear weapons.*\n\nI HOPE Tillerson and Mattis will ensure he does not...by physically restraining him, hitting him with a blunt object, shoving him until he hits a heavy object--basically knocking him comatose or killing him and saying he fell or had a heart attack.\n\nBetter that than "war as a distraction."'
"Trump is a fucking disaster but the GOP is allowing this. They could stop it but they won't. "
'Fuck the Trump voters. Fuck the purity crowd. Fuck the apathetic. Millions may die for your ignorance/petulance. This is on you guys.'
'Did anyone even read the article? The title is so misleading. Everyone on this thread seems to think Trump is one step away from launching missiles. If you read the article thats clearly not the case. What makes this article even worse is that this article’s sources are two other articles that are opinions. Not actual facts. Theres no proof that these claims are even true. Its all just speculation. Does no one question anything on this sub anymore? I feel like im taking crazy pills'
'This is why demanding that anyone with a conscience and/or moral compass resign from the administration is so off-base. I never wanted to think that Mattis and, uh, Rex Tillerson would be all that stands between us and the cusp of World War III, but good god am I glad to have them in there preaching sanity. Hopefully they hold on long enough for Mueller to get this whole Trump problem settled.\n\nAlso: what the fuck, McMaster? Can he just fuck off? Thanks.'
'They\'re debating a "bloody nose" strike to show Kim who\'s boss. Motherfucker it doesn\'t work that way. For starters China has a mutual defense treaty with North Korea. If we strike North Korea, China has a legal obligation to defend them. Secondly, when someone punches you in the nose, are you gonna just back down and slink away? Fuck no. You\'re gonna get mad and strike back however you can. Don\'t restart the war.'
'>The “bloody nose” strategy calls for a sharp, violent response to some North Korean provocation. The strategy puts a lot of weight on the US’ ability to properly calibrate an attack on North Korea and having Pyongyang read the limited strike as anything other than the opening salvo of all out war.\n\nAny student of nuclear weapons will tell you that the whole reason the US never conducted any kind of direct, "limited" strike against the Soviet Union (or vice-versa) is because if it is read as anything else by the nuclear power being attacked, the planet would be destroyed. The world\'s worst possible bet.'
'*I\'ll take "Headlines that should never happen" for... oh... about $3-5T?*\n\nThis madness needs to end. We all know how it will end if it\'s not cut short quickly.

The only way they stop is with massive sustained protests and a commitment to excise the perpetrators of this disaster from office. The Republican party is a threat to mankind, to the American republic and to the rule of law.\n\nEveryone knows where this is going. Cooler heads will not prevail. Institutions will not save you, they are completely broken and controlled by accomplices to this whole insanity.'

Almost every President who was in some sort of war during his tenure has served 2 terms. Start a war and people will be busy focusing on winning that war; forgetting about your illegitimacy.*\n\nREASON 2--\n\n*Start a war so your Russia buddy buddy can also provide weapons to your enemy and Republican donors can benefit from it; making it a never ending war.*\n\n**How fucking scary is that? Cheeses H. Rice.**"
'"My ratings are down, quick kill a couple million people!" Donald Trump'
"How does this war thing work? Even if Trump says yes, is it a go or does the Senate and house of reps have to confirm? Either way it's a lose lose. "
'If he orders a preemptive nuclear or conventional strike against NK, the 25th Amendment will be invoked shortly after the order is given.\n\nI cannot see a way that Mattis or Kelly allow it to happen knowing how fucked the world gets in that situation. '
"Nothing like a draft dodger trying to send other people's kids to die in a nuclear war..."
"It's a war that I'd leave before I fought. I would grab my clothes, my cat, and my wife and fucking bolt so goddamn fast. This country is not worth fighting for at the moment, especially over fucking Trump."
"There's a [bill in Congress](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/669) to strip the President of the power to launch a nuclear strike without a Congressional Declaration of War. You'd think even the GOP traitors could get behind this. "
"The odds that a 'bloody nose' strike against North Korea and them not attacking back with a full fledge retaliation are astronomically low.\n\nThis would be the single biggest mistake in US history and will kill millions of people plus destroy our economy and what is left of our reputation.\n\nWe will be as bad as the Nazis"
'Of all decisions the president seems inclined to make, attacking North Korea would have the worst, most irreparable, and fast-moving consequences.  If Russian sanctions are not implemented, the damage will not accumulate rapidly.  If Mueller gets fired, the FBI will continue the investigation while congress will eventually get around to impeachment.  However, if the president orders an attack on North Korea, the following scenario is imminently plausible:\n\n1.  US attacks a facility in North Korea\n2.  North Korea shells US military base near Itaewon  (middle of Seoul) to retaliate\n3.  South Korean president orders attack on all active artillery batteries in the mountains to the north\n4.  Kim knows the current path of escalation will remove a critical amount of strategic leverage over Seoul and seeks to push for an emergency ceasefire agreement by pummeling Seoul.\n\nIt would take days if not weeks to stop shells from arriving in Seoul through military force alone.  Millions could be killed.  We could not possibly fail more than to deliver the deaths of thousands of US personnel stationed in Seoul and possibly millions of South Koreans who wanted nothing to do with this.\n\nThe precedents set regarding the war powers act are not even slightly encouraging.  The only way for congress to clear the legal mud would be through passing new legislation targeted at this specific issue or to remedy the rash of other times the presidents have ordered use of the military when we are not at war or under attack etc.\n\nCongress did seem to have declared that they would act as a backstop against firing Mueller, but then a good chunk of the GOP was suddenly crying "deep state" over the properly executed removal of an agent who had expressed mulling acting on political motivations.  I would trust a new law more than I would trust the current system to give congress time to react.\n\nIt needs to be brought up more in the US conversation that North Korea is a South Korean issue.  North Korea fundamentally will not accept a solution to the Korean war that is heavily dictated by US policy, threats, and action.  North Korea has actually been very consistent in this regard.  The brinkmanship Kim is engaging in is consistent with behavior you expect from the macro-theory that allowing US influence will result in your regime being ripped apart and you being hanged by your political opponents.  The theory is quite simple:  Iraq had no nuclear deterrence.  Iraq was invaded and Saddam Hussein was hanged.  South Korea has infinitely more negotiating capability, does care about US interests enough not to hang us out to dry, but needs us to chill and get out of the way.\n\nPlease, if you are a US citizen and buy my argument that this topic is much more dangerous, has much less legal friction in the way, and is much more divergent than other issues, write a letter to your congressional  representatives demanding an expansion of the war powers act and other explicit actions to explicitly indicate that congress does not approve of a first strike without declaration of war or attack on the American or allied interests.  Furthermore we should defer authority to escalate to the South Korean government.'
"Business Insider is re-reporting this from the Telegraph and the Wall Street Journal. Both Murdoch-owned media outlets that have a reputation for bullshit. If this is true, Trump should not only be impeached, he should be given the death penalty. I don't want to believe it, and for now, I don't. At least that will let me sleep at night. "
"Who the fuck even thinks this would result in anything short of nuclear warfare??\n\nI'm baffled that McMaster thinks anything short of nuclear war would result from this. \n\nThey are just psychopaths, straight up. "

"I've been doing some googling, but can't find the answer to this: What are the penalties to violating the Presidential Records Act and who would administer these consequences? If Trump, on live TV, showed himself tearing up documents that should be preserved and throwing them into the trash, what would (ideally*) happen to him? Are there actual consequences to this?\n\n*Ideally, because if the punishment is enacted via Congress, you know that the Republicans in Congress would suddenly decide that the President is well within his rights to destroy anything he wants to."
'Yea, this is hard to be spun as fake news. But it will be.\n\nAnd don\'t forget the incoming sillyass talking point now that Trump/Bannon have split:\n\n"It\'s bad for Bannon, so it\'s good for Trump."'
'At first I was surprised that Bannon was the first of the inner circle to go before a grand jury; but considering this happened LAST WEEK after all the Fire and Fury chaos ... something strategic is obviously happening that is beyond my ken.\n\nAnd I like it!'
"I don't know what Mueller thinks he is going to find by talking to Steve.  He was such a low level guy in the campaign and in the White House.  Nobody even really knew his name until that fictitious book came out.\n\nedit: whoa!  People took this seriously?  I guess there are no more implicit /s's anymore. :("
"I hope he is really angry at the Mercer family, and shows us everything that has anything to do with Cambridge Analytica and Russians.\n\nAlso Bannon feels like to me if he witnessed a crime he will go ahead and say it because in his mind they shouldn't have committed the crime in the first place. I don't think Bannon will be used directly as a witness but he could lead the way on what questions to ask what people. Also compare his story to what Flynn has given up and straighten the timeline even more.\n\nJared Kushner seems like the type of person who is too dumb to even realize that he should be worried. I can I see that stupid grin on his face all the way to federal jail or witness protection."
'Mueller is savage. He’s picked the exact moment when Bannon is feeling vulnerable, left adrift without a paddle and his reputation in shreds. This is no accident, the sharks have smelt blood. '
"Not that I think Trump is planning to fire Mueller...\n\nBut it'd be 100x as politically damaging for him to do so now that subpoenas have starting coming into his inner circle."
'I like where this is going.\n\nEspecially since there is little that will cause more chaos than spilling out everything. Bannon loves chaos. He can create a lot of chaos here.\n\nHopefully it also all blows up in his gin-soaked face.\n\nJust a reminder for some of the people who may not have followed this thing obsessively: Bannon was the campaign CEO from August, then the first employee to enter the White House. He was Chief Strategist until he was fired. Bannon was in the inner circle for nearly a year. He knows a lot. A whole lot.'
'You know how I can tell this is a big deal?\n\nBecause the Trump-bot line in this thread is just "Oh, nothing matters, this won\'t lead to anything".\n\nNo pivots to Hillary.  No calling it fake news.  No attempts to distract with silly conspiracy theories.\n\nThey know this is a big deal.  And all they can do is pretend to be whiny and apathetic.'
"There is no universe in which Jared is not completely and totally fucked by this. There isn't a single person on this earth that Bannon hates more than Kushner. He blames everything that went wrong with Trump on Jared having the President's ear and giving him bad advice while turning Trump against Bannon.\n\nIf I were Jared I would start packing for Cumberland. "
"And he's pissed, hope he fucks himself as hard as he fucks everyone else "
'No amount of Gin is going to get this guy out of this situation.\n\nThis guys downfall has been swift and brutal. One more box checked off on my bingo sheet.\n\nIf I get Ivanka and don Jr I get a bingo. Alternative if I go down and we get c plus Santa Monica facist I get bingo that way.'

'Oh man, and you thought he hated the FBI before. This is gonna get weird.'
"This is new, unrelated to the campaign and Mueller's investigation. That means firing Mueller still leaves Ivanka in serious legal jeopardy. \n\nThis chess game is basically over."
"I grew up in Vancouver and worked for the city paper as a reporter. It's no surprise why the FBI is looking into Ivanka's business dealings here. It's obvious to anyone with a head on their shoulders there's Mainland Chinese money in the BC Lower Mainland. However, what a lot of people don't know for sure - but rightly suspect -  is much of that cash comes from Mainland businesses and business people who have ties to the CCP. China has very strict laws on how much money can be moved out of the country and there's very little room to manoeuvre unless you know higher-ups in the government. Most of the cash that flows into Vancouver ends up in real estate, too. "
"Ivanka's next business model: stealing clorox from the prison laundry to start her own anal bleaching spa for inmates."
'Get that vile nepotistic little empty human out of office. I can’t believe this is our government. '
"OK, please allow me to be superficial here for a moment.  If a man came to a business meeting wearing hot pants or shirtless, would it be appropriate to comment on this fact and make note of how in appropriate it is?? Because it seems gob-smacking to me that she would go to a meeting as seen in this CNN video with literally half her tits hanging out.

I\'ve heard "well would you trust the intelligence  community if you were Trump" I get it Trump supporters feel like the FBI is fucked up and we all know the talking points, but we the people will fix are problems, do not go bitching about them to the world, this was not a fucking Trump rally, I get it your base gets off on that shit, what ever cool do not pull that shit in front of the world, the FBI and our Intelligence community have been kicking ass for this country way before you were even thought of Trump don\'t you dare shit talk them to the world. I\'ve heard "you won\'t be happy unless he starts a nuclear war" as The President of The United States of America if you can\'t stand up for this country without starting a nuclear war then you are unfit to be president period. If you are telling me that Trump only had 2 choices turn his back on this country and bow to a foreign piece of shit on the world stage or go to nuclear war, THEN AS PRESIDENT YOU TELL THAT MOTHERFUCKER TO START LAUNCHING NUKES WE THE PEOPLE WILL DEFEND THIS GREAT NATION WITH OUR LIVES AS WE HAVE FOR OVER 200 YEARS **DON\'T YOU EVER TURN YOUR BACK ON THIS COUNTRY YOU PIECE OF SHIT.**\n\nsorry for the spelling I\'m drunk, needed to get this off my chest   '

'Transparently treasonous. The US “president” was shamefully deferential to the murderous leader of a hostile nation, while debasing American intelligence agencies in front of the world stage. So, I’m assuming the other half of Americans polled simply weren’t paying attention, as per usual. '
' Because of this history, a lot of things that might seem or feel like treason to casual observers do not, in fact, come close. In this context “enemies,” for example, must be countries against which Congress has formally declared war or otherwise authorized the use of force. (So contemporary Russia is out, whatever role it may have played in the 2016 election.) Even during the height of the Cold War, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were tried, convicted and executed [for conveying nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/julius-and-ethel-rosenberg-executed), the charge against them was espionage, not treason. - From [https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/americans-have-forgotten-what-treason-actually-means-how-it-can-ncna848651](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/americans-have-forgotten-what-treason-actually-means-how-it-can-ncna848651)'
"I'm disappointed in everyone here tonight. The whole reason why the Russians interfered with the election was to destabilize America, and after being told this, instead of trying to fix the divide created by hyperbole, bad reporting, and fear mongering from both sides of the spectrum, you all told Russia to hold your beer as you destabilize the country more than they ever could. Politics has become the equivalent of two ten year olds calling each other hackers on modern warfare 2. This doesn't excuse Trump's actions at all, but it sure as hell doesn't excuse any of yours either. Everyone here is a traitor, you played right into Russia's hands, and divided the country nearly to the point of civil war. Everyone here let the worse of themselves out, and look where it got us. I hope you are all proud of yourselves."
"You don't act treasony; you either commit treason or you don't.  Trump's comments in Helsinki were not an act of treason.  The notion that Trump is doing the bidding of the Russian government flies in the face of the actual policies of the administration.  At the same press conference where Trump supposedly sold us out to the Ruskies, Putin criticized Trump for pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal, because doing so was antithetical to Russian interests.  \n\nThis is the Birtherism of the left.  "
"I'm really getting tired of all the (over) half of Americans think x about Trump posts.  NO SHIT, over half the people that voted didn't vote for him!"
"I hate Trump as much as the next nerd, but let's be grateful that you can't be guilty of treason just because half the people who took a random poll think so.\n\nLet Mueller do his work. We'll see what comes of it.\n\nEDIT: Just googled treason.\n\n> The crime of betraying one's country\n\n... can this be investigated or something? Cause this seems pretty obvious."
"27% disagreed. That's his core base, and it's shrinking. Last time it was at 33%. Good news for November. You know, even the most ignorant of his base knows that Russia is not our friend. Most of them are my age and grew up during the height of the cold war with nuclear drills in the schools, like hiding under our desks would save us from a nuclear bomb. We grew up terrified of the USSR and now Putin wants it back. He wants to control Europe and Trump is stupid enough to think Putin will let him rule half the world with him.  "
'Summary of TD dolts on this thread:\n\n 1. 26% don\'t understand there\'s both a legal and non-legal definition of treason and get their panties in a bunch every time someone uses the term "I got robbed!\n 2. 34% don\'t understand how polls work and "derp derp Hillary gazillion percent!!!"\n 3. 29% "they didn\'t poll me fake newzzzz!!"\n 4. 11% "benghazikenyamuslimuraniumonesavemealexjones!!"\n\n'

During the Vietnam War, he was almost killed in the 1967 USS Forrestal fire. While McCain was on a bombing mission over Hanoi in October 1967, he was shot down, seriously injured, and captured by the North Vietnamese. He was a prisoner of war until 1973. McCain experienced episodes of torture and refused an out-of-sequence early repatriation offer. \n\n> The wounds that he sustained during war have left him with lifelong physical disabilities.\n\nRegarding the fire on the USS Forrestral, that killed 134 sailors and inujred  161, during which a rocket let loose and started a chain reaction:\n\n> The impact of the rocket had also dislodged two of the 1000-lb AN-M65 bombs, which fell to the deck, and lay in the pool of burning fuel between White\'s aircraft and that of Lieutenant Commander John McCain.\n\n'
"3 of the last four US presidents (Clinton, Bush, and Trump) were born less than 3 months apart and each dodged serving in Vietnam. In their respective elections, Clinton and Bush defeated people who honorably served in wars overseas (Clinton defeated George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush defeated both McCain in the primary in 2000 and Kerry in the general 2004). Those who served often have their service used against them (McCain's supposed illegitimate child in 2000 and Kerry's swiftboating in 2004). I find all of this remarkable.\n\nEDIT: And I forgot that Clinton defeated Bob Dole (served in World War II) in 1996 and Bush defeated Gore (served in Vietnam) in 2000. Remarkable.\n\nEDIT 2: correction the whispers about McCain's illegitimate child in 2000 had nothing to do with the war, but he was accused of being a traitor during both the 2000 and 2008 Republican primaries "

"I had a thought on all of this. It seems to me that the only time Trump gets really fired up is when it has something to do with his infidelity. I'm wondering if there is something in a pre-nup about Melania getting more money in a divorce if infidelity is proven. He doesn't really think he would be in criminal trouble for playing with the Russians. He's Donald Trump he thinks he can get away with anything. Threaten his money though... that's different. I think that's why he blew a gasket over Cohen getting searched. It's also why he's so adamant that he didn't overnight in Russia."

'TheDailyBeast is displaying less than stellar critical thinking skills.  In their own article:\n\n>According to Comey’s memos about that conversation, Trump claimed it was impossible for him to have done any such thing, because “he had spoken to people who had been on... the trip with him and they had reminded him that he didn’t stay over night in Russia for that.”\n\n>All available evidence proves otherwise\n\nNo.  The claim is, paraphrased, "Someone told me X"\n\n**X** may have been incorrect, but Trumps statement *could* still be factual, it is possible that Trump was truthful with what he told Comey.\n\nI\'m not saying Trump wasn\'t there overnight(the referenced Politico article *seems* to have demonstrated that he spent that friday night in Moscow), he may have even made "pee tapes", but TheDailyBeast is misleading, whether by intent or by poor ability.\n\nAnd not only with the tone of implication, they come out and state it:\n\n>Roberts’ retelling of those days in Moscow represents one of the first public contradictions of the timeline Trump offered Comey. While it does not necessarily prove the existence of a so-called “pee tape,” it does raise further questions as to why the president misled his one-time FBI director in the first place.\n\nThe article itself doesn\'t prove that Trump "misled" Comey, at all.\n\nComey\'s quote above, directly from the article, implies Trump didn\'t recall and had to get the information from someone else.\n\n/The devil is in the details.\n\nEdit: I love that this post is "controversial".  It\'s a simple article and a simple premise that I\'m calling out, but it *really* enrages some people...which is scary, yet, it\'s also highly upvoted countering all the rage faced people, so that\'s heartening.'
"Trump really is the kind of guy who'd buy hookers to piss on a bed a man who insulted him slept in once. "
'Yet more stupid shit for him to lie about. People wonder why I don’t trust him...'
"It doesn't make any goddamn sense. He lies about as well as my 10 year old. If the piss tape is real or not, why make up an alibi that is false and this easily shown to be false? Just stick to lying about the thing that is scandalous. If evidence comes up that proves you did that thing, you're just busted once. Lying about things no one cares about makes you look like you've got something to hide. Maybe there's a piece of the story I'm missing though."
'So we have established now that Trump lied to the FBI Director, which is effectively the same thing as lying to the FBI. That is, last I checked, a federal crime. '
'One time in college me and some buddies were getting ready to head out to dinner. Another guy was grabbing his car to pick us up, and he called to say he was out front. The guy who answered said "Cool, just putting my shoes on, we\'ll be there in a sec." but I was standing right next to him and could clearly see that he was wearing only boxers. He still had numerous items of clothing to put on before he would be ready. He looked at me, winked, and said "Lying is its own reward."\n\nI just say that to caution people. While this seems to confirm the pee tape - Trump\'s alleged alibi for no pee tape is clearly a lie - it doesn\'t actually prove the pee tape. It\'s entirely possible that Trump spent a completely uneventful night in Moscow and then lied to Comey about it, solely because lying gets his dick hard.\n\nThat being said, there is obviously a pee tape.'
'Holy hell this dude lies so much. We just have to have to get him under oath. Just once.'

"It's not like it proves everything about the dossier, but Trump voters, imagine Obama lying about spending a night somewhere. You'd have to think he either lied because something nefarious happened and even if nothing did, it would mean he is so emotionally weak that he lied anyway regardless of lying and looking guilty as fuck after getting caught. \n\nIt's sad for anyone, it's fucking pathetic for the President of the United States. "
"This wouldn't even be a big fucking deal, why bother lying about it? He's such an idiot. "

What exactly is he expecting to come out of this? A smart man, who actually has Americans in mind, would, ya know, compromise and back down. \n\nSeriously, think about his complete denial of global warming. This is something that is undeniably fact. Does he think that when we write history down the road, we\'re going to be able to ignore the enormous repercussions that he is creating by ignoring literally the worst crisis in human history. You won\'t be able to curtain reality by a simple tweet like he is doing now. I seriously do not understand how a man can be so incredibly idiotic and short-sighted. Does he just expect his followers to somehow strongly mobilize in three years and hope the growing backlash can\'t make it to the polling station? While horrible presidents of the past might have had the luck of having their actions corrected when they were gone as well as having their messes forgotten through time, this president isn\'t just creating problems now, but creating problems we\'ll have to untangle ourselves from for years.'

"https://twitter.com/SethAbramson/status/955920445726973952\n\nSeth Abramson sums it up in a few paragraphs, very well-written.\n\n>**(THREAD) BREAKING**: We now know two topics Mueller plans to ask Trump about: the Flynn firing and the Comey firing. And Trump is demanding that he be able to answer some questions in writing—an obvious attempt to get most or all of the questions in advance.\n  \n>**2/** The Washington Post also reports that Mueller wants to ask Trump about some related events, such as his attempts to pressure Sessions into resigning—a resignation which would have allowed Trump to appoint a new AG, and possibly given him a quick path to firing Mueller himself.\n   \n>**3/** Trump allies will seize on this story as evidence that Mueller has nothing on Trump that's directly related to Russia—a talking point you should entirely ignore, as Mueller asking Trump about Flynn (who is a cooperating witness for Mueller) is a doorway to asking about Russia.\n   \n>**4/** So yes, Mueller can ask about Flynn in a way that gets to the Obstruction question (i.e., Comey's firing) but he can also ask Trump about Flynn in a way that gets to what orders Trump gave Flynn (or others) as to negotiating sanctions with Russia during or after the campaign.\n   \n>**5/** More importantly, it's clear Mueller is much further along in his (*far easier*) Obstruction investigation than in the Conspiracy investigation—which explains why the topics he has for Trump at the moment (quite apart from what topics he might have later) focus on Obstruction.\n   \n>**6/** We know Mueller has a ways to go on his Conspiracy probe (whether it be Money Laundering-, campaign finance-, or Computer Crimes-related) because he's still seeking bank records from Europe. So it's *far* too early for him to have what he needs to ask Trump about those issues.\n   \n>**7/** Mueller knows there's *one thing* that protects him from being fired: having already referred an indictment for Obstruction to the DOJ (and likely, then, from DOJ to Congress). Why? Because Trump firing him *then* would be: (a) consciousness of guilt, and (b) more Obstruction.\n   \n>**8/** So Mueller needs to move fast on Obstruction before he's fired—and it's the easier case to make (and an impeachable offense) anyway. Nothing about The Washington Post story means Mueller isn't *also* working the Russia conspiracy angle and *won't* want to ask Trump about that.\n   \n>**9/** Granted, referring an Obstruction indictment to DOJ permanently ends all communication between Mueller and Trump—but it's little matter to Mueller: Trump is more likely to struggle to tell the truth on the Obstruction issue. On Russia, he'll just claim ignorance of everything.\n   \n>**10/** And of course if Mueller's fired he can't ask Trump about *anything*—so he has to take what he can get now, particularly if it keeps Trump from firing him. But the separate Russia angle to the Mueller investigation remains 100% alive and well after this Washington Post story.\n   \n>**CONCLUSION/** Be wary of the news over the next day: many people who don't follow the Russia story closely (and many anchors on cable news, even) will try to imply that this Washington Post story means Mueller is *only* pursuing Obstruction. \n\n>That's false—and we *know* it's false.\n"

It's going to fucking STINK as that mother fucker sweats citrus as he fumbles and bumbles his way into the noose and kicks the stand over his goddamn self. I can't wait. I can't wait. I can't wait! I want to buy Mueller flowers, take him to dinner, pick Comey up on the way and have a goddamn threesome with the both of them that's how hard my female justice boner is right now."
"> However, some of Trump’s close advisers and friends fear a face-to-face interview with Mueller could put the president in legal jeopardy. A central worry, they say, is Trump’s lack of precision in his speech and his penchant for hyperbole.\n\nIn other words, the fact that he can't stop lying all the time about everything makes this a bad idea."
'Between all the corroborated testimony Mueller has from flipped witness, all the documentary evidence they likely have from unintelligent co-conspirators (e.g. Donnie jr.\'s emails, if he\'s stupid enough to leave a paper trail, he likely wasn\'t the only one) and all the comments Trump has already publicly made, he\'s fucked.  \n\nLying exposes him to lying to the FBI charges, and all the other charges they have ample evidence on him for, and telling the truth though better still exposes him to the charges they have ample evidence on.\n\nIt will be a "I DO NOT RECALL" performance the likes of which we\'ve never seen before.'

'> An email from Goldstone to senior Trump aide Dan Scavino, now the White House director of social media, reveals a previously undisclosed topic that was discussed at the meeting. It encourages Scavino to get candidate Trump to create a page on the Russian social networking site VK, telling him that "Don and Paul" were on board with the idea -- a reference to then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump Jr.\n\nDon and Paul, always with the truly stupid and very suspicious ideas.\n\n> The disclosure of the Trump Tower meeting in a New York Times story earlier this year caught the attention of the son of Kaveladze, according to another email turned over to congressional investigators. Ike Kaveladze attended the meeting on behalf of the Russian billionaire who initiated the session, Aras Agalarov.\n\n> When Trump Jr. posted his full email exchange with Goldstone on Twitter showing he was promised the meeting would produce dirt on the Clinton campaign, George Kaveladze emailed his father asking why Trump Jr. was admitting "collusion," two sources with knowledge of the email told CNN. It was not clear whether the younger Kaveladze was joking, and the attorney for his father declined to comment on the exchange.\n\nBecause stupid watergate\n\n> In his statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee in September, Trump Jr. said the meeting was only 20 to 30 minutes and "Rob, Emin and I never discussed the meeting again. I do not recall ever discussing it with Jared, Paul or anyone else. In short, I gave it no further thought."\n\nI guess we\'ll see.  Drip drip drip'
'Jared Kushner said he emailed his assistant to get him out of the Russian meeting:\n\n>*I arrived at the meeting a little late. When I got there, the person who has since been identified as a Russian attorney was talking about the issue of a ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian children. I had no idea why that topic was being raised and quickly determined that my time was not well-spent at this meeting. Reviewing emails recently confirmed my memory that the meeting was a waste of our time and that, in looking for a polite way to leave and get back to my work, I actually emailed an assistant from the meeting after I had been there for ten or so minutes and wrote "Can u pls call me on my cell? Need excuse to get out of meeting." I had not met the attorney before the meeting nor spoken with her since. I thought nothing more of this short meeting until it came to my attention recently. I did not read or recall this email exchange before it was shown to me by my lawyers when reviewing documents for submission to the committees. No part of the meeting I attended included anything about the campaign, there was no follow up to the meeting that I am aware of, I do not recall how many people were there (or their names), and I have no knowledge of any documents being offered or accepted. Finally, after seeing the email, I disclosed this meeting prior to it being reported in the press on a supplement to my security clearance form, even if that was not required as meeting the definitions of the form.*\n\nI\'d like to see that June 9, 2016 email and a phone record of the call that supposedly got him out of that meeting.

'Shocking! Trump said something stupid \n\n(there should exist a sarcastic font invented just for Trump posts).'
"Trump is an idiot, this is well established. But we really have to dial back on the uproar every time he makes a minor gaffe. It dilutes the message. Every president has made mistakes like this, and every time there are 50 news stories about Trump doing something stupid it feeds into the message that the news is just hysterical and anti Trump. The news needs to just focus on the big problems, of which there are plenty. We shouldn't lower ourselves to pettiness just because we can.

He said there is no bottom, it is just an endless abyss. \n\nThis is exactly what people don't realize about Trump. There is no bottom for him. There is no line or actions so insensitive and cruel that he will stop. He will just go deeper and deeper into an existential chasm that is our collective nightmare. This is why you don't put people like Trump in power. Everyone knew going into this what was gonna happen. It just sucks that 60 million people wanted to commit suicide are taking the rest of the world with them."

"I'm probably already too late but I'm sure Trump is going to Tweet about how this author is somehow failing or incompetent and it will come off as really unbecoming of the office of the President."
'But yet his window licking sheep will believe every word the racist sociopath spews...'
"He boasts about the most ridiculous things. There's no shame in having ghostwriters; it's standard practice and done for practical purposes. But he has to go and seek the glory and attribute it to himself even though a) we have tens of thousands of his tweets to see his actual writing level, b) hours of speeches available to hear his lack of eloquent delivery and weak grasp of English in general, and c) his ghostwriter is known and has spoken about the writing process for his most prized book.\n\nWhy draw attention to something like this? Perhaps distraction from bigger things, but I'd put my money on plain old narcissism and the delusions of a deteriorating mind that was never all too bright to begin with.\n"
'God i wish i could leave and move to Africa. I hate this country. I hate this country. I hate this country. I hate this country.'
'If you actually read this book <i haven\'t but its been explained to me> you actually get a pretty clear vision of why Trump does and says the things that he does. He literally lays it out, word for word, his entire life strategy. Why is that funny? Because people seem to get so upset when he proceeds with international deals and relations the way he would in business. It\'s so predictable that when I hear people getting mad at these unreasonable demands upfront and then him coming to a more amicable agreement later I just laugh.\n\nHis entire methodology is laid out for the world to see and people keep falling for it, over and over again. This time on a world stage.\n\nThe long and the short of it is "Be unreasonable at the start, make ridiculous demands and then come back to the negotiating table. This time under the pretext of being more reasonable and reach a deal that either favors him or is a middle ground where both sides can claim to have won something of value."\n\nThat\'s it. That\'s literally his strategy for everything and once again, Reddit and everyone else keeps falling for it because they get so emotionally invested in the initial ridiculous demands that they are willing to deal once everyone inevitably comes back to the bargaining table.\n\nI doubt it works all the time but the fact that it even works at all despite the strategy being made public via his book is hilarious. There are now thousands of stories since he became president of journalists being duped and drawn into this simple tactic that really goes to show you that people are more interested in hating him than understanding him. Which if you knew anything about going to war with someone, knowing your enemy is key.'
"No wonder he calls information fake. He doesn't even know what it is, the poor thing."
'Waiting on the *"The man who lied about "co-authoring" my book begged me to let him write it! And I said, "No Deal!" He\'s also a very low ip person. #MAGA #40%OFFMAGAGEAR #TRUMPGEARSALE"* tweet'
'These attacks are being recycled.  Everyone’s heard this shit before and it hasn’t worked.\n\nIf you want to stop President Trump, win the House and impeach (there should be enough in Mueller to make a case for it).\n\nWhere is the DNCs contract with America?  Where is dnc leadership?  Perez what’re you doing?!'
'He cannot talk either. He interrupts his own interruptions. '
'I read the book a couple of years ago out of curiosity. Pretty worthless. The only thing I remember is how he was so sick of seeing an ice skating rink not being renovated from his office window that he decided to do it himself and kept bragging about it. '
'His followers will just believe these are more people hired by the massive liberal conspiracy to make Trump look bad.  It’s sad.'
'What an idiot this guy is who is also an evil genius bent on exterminating everyone who’s not white because he’s so stupid he dog whistles cleverly to the public because he’s secretly spying with Russia to undermine the US because he can’t read because he’s so sinister he engineered an entire election and masterfully maneuvered his way into the presidency illegally with a secret plan that was so well executed we couldn’t do anything to stop it and he watches the gorilla channel all day long, what an idiot'

'Can we go one day without Republican party fucking up the country. Recession is on its way. #VoteTheMidterm'

"Dinesh D'Souza is human garbage who [abused his wife.](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/department-justice/dsouza-spared-prison-time-980347)\n\n> D’Souza, who was married to the defendant for 20 years, wrote, “In one instance, it was my husband who physically abused me in April 2012 when he, using his purple belt karate skills, kicked me in the head and shoulder, knocking me to the ground and creating injuries that pain me to this day.”"
'D\'Souza is a little golden child for neocons, and his anti-Democrat rhetoric plays well to the Fox News crowd. This pardon is nothing but an appeal to his base, and a signal that he\'s willing and ready to hand out pardons like scoops of ice cream.\n\nHere are some choice highlights of his distinguished career, taken from his Wikipedia page. See if you can spot the similarities between him and 45:\n\n**He cheated on his wife**\n\n> In an October 16, 2012, article in World Magazine, author Warren Cole Smith reported on D\'Souza\'s activities after a September 28 talk that year in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Smith said D\'Souza, who was married at the time, checked into a hotel with another woman and left with her the following day. In his rebuttal, D\'Souza said that he and his wife had separated. \n\n**He was conviced of campaign finance crimes**\n> On January 24, 2014, D\'Souza was arraigned in a Manhattan federal court on charges of making $20,000 in illegal campaign contributions to the New York Senate campaign of Wendy Long, and for causing false statements to be made to the Federal Election Commission.\n> \n> **In May 2014, D\'Souza pleaded guilty to one felony count of making illegal contributions in the names of others. In September 2014, the court sentenced D\'Souza to five years probation, eight months in a halfway house (referred to as a "community confinement center") and a $30,000 fine.**\n> \n> D\'Souza\'s attorney had argued his client "did not act with any corrupt or criminal intent whatsoever" and described the incident as "at most...an act of misguided friendship". **His co-producers alleged that the indictment was politically motivated retribution for the success of his 2012 movie 2016: Obama\'s America.**\n\n**He makes up facts and spreads propaganda**\n> D\'Souza wrote and co-directed the documentary polemical film 2016: Obama\'s America. Through interviews and reenactments, the film compares the similarities in the lives of D\'Souza and President Barack Obama. D\'Souza suggested that early influences on Obama affected the decisions he made as president. The film\'s tagline is "Love him or hate him, you don\'t know him." T**he film has been criticized on the grounds that what D\'Souza claims to be an investigation of Obama includes considerable projection, speculation, and selective borrowing from Obama\'s autobiography, to prove D\'Souza\'s own narrative. In a "Fact Check" of the film, the Associated Press found that D\'Souza provided little or no evidence for most of his claims, noted that several allegations were factually false, and described the film\'s central thesis as "almost entirely subjective and a logical stretch at best."**\n\n**He spewed disgusting rhetoic about the Parkland shootings that even conservatives couldn\'t defend.**\n> In February 2018, D\'Souza was widely criticized for a series of tweets which mocked the survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.[56][57] In response to a photo of survivors reacting to Florida lawmakers voting down a proposed ban on assault weapons in the aftermath of the shooting, D\'Souza tweeted **"worst news since their parents told them to get summer jobs"**. D\'Souza\'s comments were condemned by both liberal and conservative commentators. Jonathan M. Katz wrote "Let it never be said that Dinesh does not actively root for the death of children." Others accused D\'Souza of "trolling kids".D\'Souza was also denounced by Conservative Political Action Conference, which removed him from the roster of speakers, and called his comments "indefensible".\n\n\nNo wonder Trump loves him. He\'ll probably be on his legal team by the end of the week.'
"Trump has now pardoned people who have:\n- Obstructed Justice\n- Outed confidential sources\n- Disobeyed federal judges orders\n- Committed Finance Violation\n\nHe and his campaign are also being investigated for the same crimes.

'Jist to copy paste myself:\n\nIt should be mentioned \\- D\'Souza pleaded guilty:\n\n[https://www.fbi.gov/contact\\-us/field\\-offices/newyork/news/press\\-releases/dinesh\\-dsouza\\-sentenced\\-in\\-manhattan\\-federal\\-court\\-to\\-five\\-years\\-of\\-probation\\-for\\-campaign\\-finance\\-fraud](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/newyork/news/press-releases/dinesh-dsouza-sentenced-in-manhattan-federal-court-to-five-years-of-probation-for-campaign-finance-fraud)\n\nThe man said in court that he was guilty, and Trump\'s response is to say "Well, the government was mean to him it really wasn\'t a crime."\n\nAnd what are the odds that Trump is getting revenge by this pardon:\n\n>\tPreet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced today that DINESH D’SOUZA was sentenced in Manhattan federal court to five years of probation, with eight months during the first year to be served in a community confinement center, after having pled guilty to violating the federal campaign election law by making illegal contributions to a United States Senate campaign in the names of others. D’SOUZA was sentenced today before U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman. \n\nYeah.  Preet got this man to \\*confess in court that he broke the law\\*.

And just wait, Fox News will be screaming about freedoms being stolen. Well, assholes, it’s because you try to cheat others. That’s what checks and balances are for. \n\nIn conclusion: Goddamnit. '

'So basically any charges brought against his thugs have to be made by a state AG to avoid presidential pardons.\n\nThis is totally disgusting. Fuck the GOP.'
"This is really disgusting. This man pled guilty to the crime that he committed, gets a slap on the wrist, and yet Trump still finds the punishment too harsh and gives D'Souza a pardon.

"To you this is what it means.\n\nTo his cult like fan base he is simply getting rid of a fake problem so he can get on with the job. And add something bad about Hillary because they can't move on... Etc"
"I don't think that's actually right. To start, I know Trump is guilty of treason.\n\nBut as a legal argument this is poor. Look at jack Johnson. the pardon doesn't mean the man committed an impeachable crime. Fuck, he can pardon someone for any federal crime including a summary offense, which by definition isn't a high crime or misdemeanor. \n\nBut, if trump pardons himself, he must be impeached. But not because it's an admission of guilt by law, but because it would mean the President is asserting there are no laws he need obey."
'How the fuck can you pardon yourself as President? Then you’d never have to be held accountable for anything. Leave to a stupid twat to come up with that idea. '
'No shit'

'This is against the whole reason for this country.  He is not an elected King.  He is not above the law.  If he is found guilty of these crimes he should spend time in prison.  The average person in prison commited crimes that are not near as bad as what Trump is accused of.  This is treason what he has done and his obvious colluding with Russia is as well.  Our president is working for a hostile foreign power.  Its obvious with his pro-Russia agenda (e.g. him trying to get them back into the G7, while pissing off Canada to the point they have threatened to remove the US).  The POTUS has Russias interest over that of the USAs.  This is called treason and in the past was punishable by death.  It blows my mind that he has not been kicked out of office and whats crazier is the GOP has whole heartedly taken up his agenda.  WTF!?!?!?'

'Fuck that. \n\nMueller, fuck these guys up already. '
"Remember when Obama was told by the ethics council that appointing even *distant* family members to *distant* government positions would be horrendously unethical if not legally actionable?  \n  \nThen Trump puts his daughter and son-in-law down the hall from him in high-level White House positions and apparently that's fine.  \n  \nAnyone with two brain cells to rub together that I see defending Trump is defending the corruption and dismantlement of western democracy."

'Is the media really this stupid or just this spineless?\n\nWhy has right wing politics consisted of lying to their voters and disenfranchising everyone else from voting?  Why are right wing voters consistently the most ill-informed demographics every year for decades?\n\nThe only reason anyone anywhere sees the Republican Party as a legitimate political party in a democracy is because the media goes out of their way to portray them as such.  Portraying blatant intentional lies as honest ideological differences is exactly what disingenuous lying people depend on.  Don\'t even acknowledge their opinion as a legitimate opinion of it isn\'t fact based.  Simply take out the falsehoods, highlight them and simply ask the viewer why they would be lying?  \n\nYou don\'t even show your audience their full narrative.  You\'ve seen it and you know it has false information.  It is impossible to reach a valid conclusion based on logic using false assumptions.  Therefore an opinion based on a falsehood is objectively invalid and therefore useless and wrong.  No need to waste anyone\'s time repeating it.  \n\nThe news is that someone could have such an objectively wrong opinion.  If the president says "I think 1+1=banana", you don\'t need to repeat that to report to your audience that the president is mathematically illiterate.  And you certainly don\'t need to repeat it as if it\'s actually up for debate.  Not everyone with an opinion is an expert, or even right, or even not objectively wrong.  The right depends on the left forgetting that, or as is often the case, ignoring it in misguided attempts at equality.\n\nThe dishonest do not deserve the benefit of the doubt like decent people.  If you choose to operate outside the rules and norms of decent society, you have absolutely no reason to expect the benefits of decent society. You don\'t treat the serially dishonest as if they are acting in good faith, you ignore and ostracize them.  There are enough decent people who need help and warrant attention to waste time on those who choose to be garbage.\n\n'

"The American President meeting with the leader from Russian on a trip to Asia is not at all nefarious and is to be expected. It's not supsicious at all... WHAT IS SUSPICIOUS is when they meet privately and they don't release any notes of the meeting to the public like what happened in July at the G20. That's suspicious as fuck... As if they don't want us to know what they talked about. It's also suspicious that only Rex Tillerson was with Trump on the American side for that meeting. As if they didn't want anybody else outside of the President's direct orbit to hear what they talked about. That's also pretty fucking suspicious. "
"He's a moron. If you're under investigation for drugs, you don't go to a known drug dealers' house. He should be staying as far away from Putin as possible. At least have someone else have the meeting. I can't wait until his fat ass is impeached."
"Putin fucked with our elections. Trump doesn't want to confront him on it. Fine, I actually get that logic, twisted as it is. \n\nOther Republican leaders though? Shameful. Disgraceful. Traitorous. \n\nTrump voters who insist that the story is nothing? You do so because you WANT it to be nothing. You aren't evaluating truth; you're picking your 'facts' to justify your feelings. Sorry to bash regular Americans, but you'll never be able to was off the shame you are covering yourself with, and when I hear how bad your communities are, your unemployment problems, your opiod problems, I can't give you my full sympathy because you refuse to live in full reality."
'Trump cries "witch hunt!" Then meets "witch" for lunch. '
"The frustrating thing is that no matter what Putin does in this situation, he still comes on top. Meets with Trump? Suspicious as fuck. Doesn't meer with Trump? Suspcious as fuck. That suspcion works to his advantae and it angers me how all of this controversy plays into his hands. Regardless of what the Trump Adminiatration does, he still comes out on  top because he has stirred the pot and made an example of US of the weak nature of democracy. All by exploiting weaknesses already present in our country. He played us at our own game."
"I've said this earlier and elsewhere but, as this week's elections show, the political pendulum will eventually swing back the other way. When sanity comes back to DC whoever is in charge will need to smack down Russia so the interference not only stops but never happens again. Whatever form that takes, it will harden tensions to a degree almost none of us have experienced. The American blow-back, its ripple effect, the potential escalation, all of it plead for the idea that Russia has made a terrible mistake in carrying this outright, wall-to-wall assault on US democracy. And it doesn't bode well for the future.\n\nAnd that's just the tip of America's current problems. Tough times ahead , mates. Tough times."

"You know there's no way Putin didn't make a recording of the conversation they had in there. Just more kompromat at this point. Only Trump would be fucking stupid enough to think he could go in there and have a candid conversation and it not be recorded."
'I absolutely agree with this.  Trump is a Narcissistic Sociopath who lies constantly just to be lying and always advising how he should be praised for doing such a great job along with he’s a self proclaimed genius.  Let’s not forget that he’s put the whole Country in danger, they should absolutely subpoena the interpreter and the Republicans need to get their fingers out of their ass and fucking impeach the worst president in history. '
'Is a certain interpreter gonna commit suicide or die in a car accident suddenly? '
'I just assumed the interpreter was provided by Russia... and dead by now.'
'I can see it now: In the next few days the interpreter will be found dead in their office from two gunshots to the back of the head.  It will be deemed a suicide by the White House, Secret Service  and local law enforcement.\n\nExcept of course for the one lone detective that thinks it was murder.'
"Big question here is, why don't Republicans want to know what was said behind closed doors?  \n\nScared of the god awful dick sucking and the incredible ass kissing Trump performed. "
"This may be a weird stance from me, since I'm strongly in favor of impeachment but...it would be a terrible precedent for transcripts of high-level talks between world leaders to be public knowledge. The topics discussed should be classified. Granted, it was very strange that no experts were allowed to sit in, but that doesnt mean the public, or even congress, should have detailed knowledge of what was discussed.\n\nWith that being said, everything about the Putin meeting and the subsequent press conference was a national disgrace, and Trump should be impeached for it (among myriad other reasons, but this should be the straw that breaks the camel's back)."
'In unrelated news, a russian interpreter sadly took his own life after binding and gagging himself, beating himself within an inch of his own life, shooting himself in the head, and irradiating himself apparently, before throwing his own lifeless corpse off a rooftop into an oncoming train. Police are not investigating as it is clearly a suicide, all hail Emperor Putin.'
'“In other sad news today a White House interpreter stabbed herself self in back and leapt from third floor window, and now sports!”'
'This is getting ridiculous.  100% Putin was wearing a wire. He would have had the entire fiasco recorded, probably including video. Can you see Trump asking his handlers to do the same? '
'Great, another civil servant the Republicans can humiliate for no reason.'
'Interpreter found dead in 3...2...1...'
'It is about time that trump was reigned in, at least until they can impeach. Demand his tax returns immediately as well. Protest around the country to control this treasonous bastard.'

"Imagine if Obam.....\n\nah fuck it. I'm tired of typing this already."
'Look at all those crisis actors! '
"Trump's America is 1984 and thanks to the biased media, he is able to get away with major crimes weekly.  \n\nFor example, he leaked a classified document this week (the jobs report) before it was made public.  Also, it was totally filled with lies.  \n\nThe media?  Silent.  They're in his pocket and won't report on his criminal activity, and it is downright terrifying.  \n\nThe economy is in a tailspin, poverty and homelessness are out of control, people are dying in record numbers because Trump and the GOP took away the insurance mandate, and the middle class is taking home far less money every week because trump unfairly placed the tax burden all on them while the rich pay next to nothing.  \n\nHow can trump get away with giving out classified info on Twitter of all places?  How can the middle class not riot as they are losing their homes and lives?  What reality are we in?!  "

'Holy fuck that guy is an embarrassment. Forgetting the words is one thing but holding a fake rally because you got pissed that some pro sport players did not show up to your house. Thats some “my sweet 16” melt down shit.  '
'Just want to say, looking over from this side of the Atlantic, the notion that the president tried to deflect from an embarrassing no-show protest (to a drama solely of his own making) by blaming the protesters for a lack of patriotism (falsely), and in its stead drown out the protest by holding a substanceless ultra-patriotic event worshipping the flag*, is fairly disturbing.\n\n*filled out with, of the WH press members are insinuating, supporters of the administration rather than claimed Philly fans'

'We can’t be fooled into thinking Trump is stupid or unaware of his actions. He became president by stirring up the old “divide and rule” tactic that the British used a few hundred years ago to break their colonies from the inside, so that ruling them would become easier.\n\nHe’s doing the same thing. He’s dividing society into different groups, and strangely no one seems to care or do anything about it. He’s desensitizing society by slowly bringing out one planned out “scandal”after the other. At this rate, we’ll be used to everything he does, and it will be the new norm. That is unacceptable. \n\nThis inhumane lying piece of shit is purposefully breaking society for him and his follower’s prosperity, while the vast majority of us will get nothing (as has always been the case with the top 1%), all while working our butts off 40 hrs a week to feed their unquenchable greed.\n\nHis tweets and messages need to be responded to. There needs to be a regular news conference with the president-live telecasted so he can’t pull the “fake news” card- and confront him on his innumerable misinforming and sinister tweets. If we keep listening to him, as we do now, and don’t pressure our politicians to have a public dialogue where we can challenge his lies, we will surely be left fucked.'

'>A top Environmental Protection Agency official resigned Tuesday in protest of the direction the EPA has taken under President Trump.\n\n>**Elizabeth "Betsy" Southerland ended her 30-year run at the agency with a scathing exit letter in which she claimed that “the environmental field is suffering from the temporary triumph of myth over truth.” She last worked as the director of science and technology in the Office of Water.**\n\n>**“The truth is there is NO war on coal, there is NO economic crisis caused by environmental protection, and climate change IS caused by man’s activities,”** Southerland wrote, directly rejecting many of Trump’s claims.\n\n&nbsp;\n>She took aim in particular at Trump\'s demand that two federal regulations be struck from the books for every new one added.\n\n>**“Should EPA repeal two existing rules protecting infants from neurotoxins in order to promulgate a new rule protecting adults from a newly discovered liver toxin?”** she wrote. **“Faced with such painful choices, the best possible outcome for the American people would be regulatory paralysis where no new rules are released so that existing protections remain in place.”**\n\n&nbsp;\n>She added that in the past the EPA had been a **“guiding light to make the ‘right thing’ happen for the greater good,”** but that the Trump administration has hurt the agency’s ability to protect the planet.\n\n>**“It may take a few years and even an environmental disaster, but I am confident that Congress and the courts will eventually restore all the environmental protections repealed by this administration because the majority of the American people recognize that this protection of public health and safety is right and it is just,”** Southerland wrote.\n\n'

There is no escaping this thing, whatever the conclusions.”\n\nKeep in mind, this is Mueller's request ONLY for WH records as President. This does not include Trump as a private citizen and whatever Mueller might be looking at there. \n\nThis makes the Manafort listing extra interesting. Because Manafort is the only thing here mentioned from during the campaign. That makes me wonder if perhaps he wants to catch Trump in a lie about Manafort due to him possibly being caught on tape. \n\nI've added links to stories that are most relevant to each given bullet point to explain what specifically Mueller is looking at/why he might be looking at it. \n\n\nEdit : Updated \n\nps : If you think Trump + Co just walk away from charges I'm going to have to say you are wrong, you don't get a team this serious involved if they just expect everyone to walk away as if nothing happened. We'll see if I'm right about that. \n"

"Imagine being 71 years old. Your money is all tied up in real estate and you can't get a loan stateside because of your reputation for not paying people back. You start borrowing from Russia in exchange for some laundering. No big deal. No one will find out. \n\n\nWith your name being the most profitable thing you own, you decide to get a corner of the conservative news market, TrumpTV. Afterall, these people have been eating up your birther non-sense for the past 8 years, they're rubes, they're idiots and they're mad. \n\n\nLike any new product launch, you need a marketing campaign. Last time you ran for president it gave you a boost. Sure you ducked out early because there was no way in hell you could beat Obama but it showed you something much more important, your new audience and what would later slim down into your base. \n\n\nSo you're blessed with a cattle call of candidates. Dividing and splitting away the neo-con establishment's ability to pick their mule. You make it to the general. Now here's where Flynn, Lewandowski and Manfort really sale you on a Russian deal. Voter rolls that can be used to micro-target swing states through tailored social media fake news and massive ad buys on Facebook and twitter. Not to mention, hundreds of millions of bots created on Russian farms pushing all of it. If it works you're President. If it doesn't you can spend the next years of your life getting TrumpTV off the ground with claims the election was rigged. My guess is Trump bet on the latter. His face on election night tells that story. \n\n\nNow he's here. Maybe months away from being completely exposed. The tweets, the constant unrest, and stress, the ridiculous daily bullshit, it can't save him from what is being put together by the man who we chose to lead the FBI directly after September 11th, 2001.\n\n\nTo say the least, I think it's safe to say Donald J. Trump is taking a huge shit inside his pants. \n\nEDIT: My first Gold! Thank You whoever you are. \n"
'How the GOP continues to remain an adamant supporter of this piece of shit president is a good indicator of how complicit they are in this treasonous clusterfuck. '
'Honestly, I am too stressed out about Healthcare to give a shit. \n\n'
'I hated the fact Trump allowed the Russians right into the Oval Office after firing Comey, so disgraceful. Not to mention, everyone with any ability to read knows Trump has always been a deadbeat, never paying his bills, nor actually donating money he claims he does. Just a disgrace for the USA-all because of racism towards Mr. Obama. '
"It's funny how with each passing day, fewer and fewer MAGA boys make their voices known here. They knew they fucked up when they voted for him. They just don't care because they're narcissistic white nationalists."
'Whenever I see a post come up on r/politics I sort by controversial to see how desperately the right wing in the USA try to deny that they are effectively a fascist entity. '
"Okay so my take on this development given the announcements yesterday (Rosenstein, Manafort, etc):  \n  \nBasically, Rosenstein being interviewed and now the search for White House documents suggest that Trump himself (alongside Sessions) is being investigated for obstruction. I think this story more or less confirms it. They interviewed Rosenstein supposedly and now the request for documents about firing Comey suggests that Mueller is probably finding tons of holes in their official reasons for firing Comey- Clinton's Email Investigation.  \n  \nI bet there's a recording, document, email, or some sort of smoking gun showing that Trump fired Comey specifically over the Russia investigation and then had Sessions and/or Rosenstein (likely not Rosenstein, judging by the language in yesterday's story about him) lie about it and create a front that Clinton's Emails were the real reason. I'm guessing Mueller already has evidence or testimony of some sort confirming Trump and Sessions cooked this up in a lame attempt to end the Russia investigation.  \n  \nPair this with Trump's disclosure to the Russians in the Oval Office as well as his admission to Lester Holt that he fired Comey over Russia, and boom you have a very unreliable potential testimony from Trump already. And I feel like Mueller will have an airtight obstruction case, given that same charge (after the smoking gun tape was found) ended up sinking Nixon. Although, Nixon had a democrat congress after 1972, which is odd. But most Republicans supported impeachment after the smoking gun tape came out.  \n  \nIt's a matter of time before a similar revelation of evidence will occur and if the GOP leadership sees it'll sink their majority in 2018, they'll bail on Trump. Unless, of course, it really is this giant conspiracy involving nearly every high-up republican congressman or senator. Then we're going to have a crisis akin to the Civil War."
"MUELLER IS SAVAGE AND I LOVE IT.\n\nTrump's ENTIRE life he has never had to answer for his crimes...he got away with everything by bullying everyone.\n\nAnd now he thinks he's especially untouchable because he's the President.\n\nBut he has no idea...he thinks he can keep playing his game the way he always has and face no consequences. He has no idea that this is Mueller's turf and on this turf Mueller is a God among men. \n\nMueller is about to wipe the floor with Trump. Mueller is like Darth Vader, Superman, Wolverine, Neo, Arya Stark, and Thor all wrapped up in Captain America.\n\nTrump is an even stupider version of Dr. Evil.\n\nAnd he honestly has no clue how bad it is yet. I wonder when it will finally hit him? When will he realize he can't just pay someone off or pardon himself and that he has to face the music?  \n\nDamn I wish I could be there to see it. "
'The spin going for this story by Trump surrogates on CNN is fucking bonkers. I cannot believe they have found people who seriously will go on TV and say this is a witch hunt because "anonymous sources".\n\nHoly fucking hell. How much are they paying these people?'
"As many people have said, the worst thing that could have happened to trump is becoming the president. All of his shady underhanded dealings would've remained that, had he just not taken the dare."
"to anyone who doesn't think trump is enough of a focus in the investigation: trump is absolutely the main target. everything being done is to get to him, which is why mueller is being so aggressive with manafort. he's going to throw an indictment at him that lands him in prison for life as leverage to get him to flip. \n\nwatch for trump's behavior to get increasingly erratic because of this nytimes news and yesterday's cnn news about manafort being tapped. \n"

"It's seriously extraordinary that many people (on the right) still believe that Trump is not working with Russia.\n\nA) He's made it so exceedingly obvious and, B) So many people, including people who aren't Republicans, are still unwilling to accept the full reality of this fundamental fact. I mean, a sitting US President refuses to enforce Russian sanctions, frequently meets with Russians, has a team almost entirely up to their necks in specifically Russian connections, trashes NATO, fulfills all of Russia's geopolitical goals, meets with Putin, in private, with literally no other Americans in the room to provide witness for what he's saying. All in less than a year. That's mind-blowing. That's legitimately one of the craziest things to ever happen in politics, period. It's unheard of for a leader of a nation as wealthy, powerful and large as the US to have a leader so hopelessly, obviously compromised by the leader of a much weaker nation and everyone just sort of shrugs.\n\nI mean, I truly don't know how to comprehend the level of denial. I'm just waiting for the aftershock when most of the population finally catches on. Watching it slowly dawn on all the majority of of America that the President is a really stupid, gullible Russian asset."
'Pandora\'s box has been opened, and no amount of propoganda is going to wipe that from the public\'s mind. They have a single word to associate with Trump now, just like Hillary\'s been (Unfairly) haunted by  the word "Emails". \n\nTrump really screwed up. There\'s no recovering from this on any front except the measily 10% that are still buying into Russian propoganda. '
'Watched it live, and the thing I took away most was this: Putin did an excellent job with actually listening to and answering the questions asked by journalist. Meanwhile, Trump answered everything by ranting on meaningless talking-points he’s been repeating for ages that not only had little to do with the question, but also led nowhere (he’d talk off-topic to the point where he’d forget the actual question). \n\nSimply, Trump and Putin could’ve been arguing the size of the burger patty on a whopper, and Putin would’ve owned him just based on rhetoric and discourse. \n\nAs an American, every time this hypocritical human carrot opens his mouth is humiliating. '
'Trump is terrible he is the most un american president i have ever seen. what president just praises putin and throws america under the bus.

Not because you can't, but because you don't want to.\n\nTime to change that. Protest. All of you.

They would much rather get rid of him on any of the other smaller scale things (preferably something like lying under oath about a sex scandal) because the rest of the world would be able to swallow that.'

"This is a federal crime 18 U.S.C. § 1512, state crime in all states, and common law crime dating back to the 16th century.

"So Trump has tried or contemplated firing Sessions, Rosenstein, Mueller and McCabe. The Trump team has also engaged in witness tampering.

He's just building his case and seeing if Trump or someone else perjures themselves."

Wouldn\'t Mueller already be aware of what Comey/McCabe think being that they leak? \n\nIs this a sign that the FBI is having an internal civil war since they themselves say McCabe is a liar/leaker? \n\nMy questions will probably attract pro-Trump comments of "McCabe is a traitor!" and anti-Trump comments of "McCabe is a saint!" but I\'m looking more for observations based on facts that we know not cheerleading. \n\nI wish they (Mueller/Comey/McCabe/Whoever) would just leak the proof that Trump is a Russian agent because its past the point where public opinion isn\'t already polarized. \n'

"Jimmy Carter's biggest scandal was that his drug czar handed out quaaludes at a party... which is the most 70's scandal ever."
"I think this is a bit of a reach. Trump has surrounded himself with millionaires and wealthy elites. Of course some had business or contact with Russian companies or Russian oligarchs.\n\nFailing to disclose that information in the context of accepting a formal administration role is indeed problematic, especially in Wilbur Ross' and Kushner's case. But really wealthy people typically do business and communicate with other wealthy people all around the world.\n\nThat all said, I still think there is reason to believe the Trump campaign committed conspiracy against the US during the 2016 election. Collusion will be difficult to prove, but the Trump Jr. meeting and some of the information Papadopoulos has provided indicate the Trump campaign cognizantly communicated with Kremlin intermediates with the goal of obtaining information on Hillary Clinton. That could be conspiracy, even if no information was actually obtained during that meeting or any communication."
"I'm starting to worry that Trump himself might be saved by the simple fact that he's too lazy to actually do anything himself. Maybe everyone around him was working hard on conspiring with Russia while he was just watching TV and tweeting angrily. "

Trump is profiting off of domestic spending. That's ALSO wrong. "

According to recently released CIA cables she directly and personally oversaw the torture of multiple detainees at CIA black sites. Haspel recently was successful in getting the video recordings of her torture sessions destroyed:\n\n>When questions began to swirl about the Bush administration’s use of the “black sites,” and program of “enhanced interrogation,” the chief of base began pushing to have the tapes destroyed. She accomplished her mission years later when she rose to a senior position at CIA headquarters and drafted an order to destroy the evidence, which was still locked in a CIA safe at the American embassy in Thailand. Her boss, the head of the agency’s counterterrorism center, signed the order to feed the 92 tapes into a giant shredder.\n\nShe is currently being sued by the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights for her role in the torture of Saudi nationals and since December there has been pressure on the German Prosecutor General to issue an arrest for Haspel on charges of war crimes.\n\ntl;dr the new CIA director is a war criminal who will likely have us torturing innocent people on black sites again.'

"\n>On the flight from Nigeria, Tillerson appeared to break with the White House in his assessment of the poisoning of an ex-spy in Britain. He singled out Russia as responsible for the attack, echoing the finger-pointing of the British government.\n\n>“It came from Russia,” Tillerson said, according to the Associated Press. “I cannot understand why anyone would take such an action. But this is a substance that is known to us and does not exist widely.”\n\n>Earlier Monday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders condemned the attack as “reckless, indiscriminate and irresponsible,” and expressed solidarity with Britain, but would not say whether the United States believes Russia was behind it.\n\nWorse than that, SHS engaged in an absolute Twister-like effort *not* to say the word Russia. I have a feeling Tillerson's failure to toe the bullshit line in this was the last straw.\n\nSo now Trump will have Pompeo scrambling to catch up just as he's supposed to be dealing with North Korea, a trade war breaks out with Europe, and Russia commences to frig up the 2018 elections.\n\nUnreal."
"So the talking point is Putin didn't want Romney, made Trump pick his friend Tillerson for SoS, then made Trump fire him for saying mean things about Russia. Notice SHS won't utter the word 'Russia' even when referring to May calling them out. The Democrats need to go on full attack on the Senate floor and every TV news shows calling out the White House for conspiring with Russia. Make this as big a story as possible, so even red staters start to doubt Trump."

"As of now the State Department put out a formal statement directly contradicting the White House account that Tillerson knew in advance.\n\nThen the Undersecretary who issued the contradictory account was fired.\n\nSo it really seems like the State Department and Rex want it known that this came out of the blue today.  But the White House put out several elaborate and detailed accounts about how this took place over days.  \n\nOne of them is lying.  If the White House is lying then why go through all the trouble?  Maybe because they realize how totally FUCKED it would be that Tillerson got fired over his Russian attribution of the nerve gas attack?\n\nThe UK is going to formally blame Russia and we're not going to do shit.

'This is obvious isn’t it? \n\nTrump fires Sally Yates because she wouldn’t back his unconstitutional bans.\n\nTrump fires Comey because he won’t pledge loyalty to him and also because he has power to look into his dealings. \n\nNext Trump fires Hope Hicks, who admitted she lies for him sometimes.\n\nNow with Tillerson’s ousting, it seems quite obvious it’s because he was (surprisingly) a voice of reason amidst chaos. Calling Trump a fucking moron a while back probably didn’t help either tbh. But more recently with the Russians chemical attack in the UK, it seems obvious that Tillerson wanted to respond, and Trump was forced to cut him loose by Putin. \n\nSame reason Romney was passed over for the same position; Tillerson must’ve started to have a conscience and wanted to fight back, but the Russians couldn’t have that. So Don the Puppet had his strings played with today. Sad. \n\nEdit: conscience because I no can spellz gud. /s'

'So your saying Trump isn\'t allowed to block people because Twitter is a "public forum" but people are banned all the time for political views or false reporting? Make up your mind, it\'s either a public forum where 1A rights apply or it\'s a private company with it\'s own rules.\n\nEdit: unfortunately reddit limits how much you can respond so I can\'t respond to all of 10 of you spamming the same articles that dont mean anything'
'Ok, i much as i hate trump i don\'t understand something.\n\nHow does blocking on twitter is violating people rights ? Because if this is illegal for trump this should be too for any random dude. And if i ignore someone in the street, am i violating this person right ?\n\nI am not a citizen of the usa so maybe my point of view when it come to freedom of speech is different but when trump block people on a private company service on a personal account (not "President of the usa" kind of account which could have been used by Obama for example) i don\'t see the problem. The people blocked are still free to share their thinking with everyone else...\n'
'Here these people are doing this and Twitter is currently soft-banning thousands of users for ever mentioning crypto or mentioning anything negative about the DNC. It happened to me. Check new on /r/twitter the news isn’t talking about that. It’s just a bad platform that’s failing all around.'
"I mean yeah, sure, it's disturbing that the president is ignoring a court order but... I can't help but laugh at this. We're all living in a Dril tweet now. "
'This is just a whole new low. Waste of the court time and money. His twitter account is a private account, if it was a presidential twitter account then I can see this being a thing. \n\nIt’s sad what the extent the liberals will go to. '
"They could just log out of Twitter and then look at his tweets.... ... ... This lawsuit is shameful.  Serious complaints by people who were actually harmed are being put aside so we can bring justice to those who... were blocked on a private company's website.  Fucking egregious."
'seems mad petty'
'We are really bitching about someone blocking people on Twitter in 2018....'
'Why does this have 21k upvotes? The premise itself just sounds so stupid'
"Who gives a fuck. It's Twitter for crying out loud. "
'So i guess all the twitter accounts by conservatives who were shadow banned or banned in general should sue twitter?'
"What a waste of time and money.\n\nCan someone please tell them that if the log out they can see what his tweets are.  Why anyone would hate themselves so much as to follow Trump on twitter just so they can be angry at what he says there makes no sense to me but you don't need to get the damn courts involved.\n\nI swear its like Americans are addicted to being angry or something.\n"
"What gets me. Is the hypocracy of most Americans. On one hand. Members of the left are always trying to silence opposing views by labeling people as sexist, racist and bigoted then suggesting they dont deserve a platform to speak on. News flash. No sane people in the world agree with hate speech, But it's still free speech. Now the left is crying 1A when 7 people who despise Trump are blocked from his Twitter.\n\nThe right is just as hypocritical as the left. But what gets me the most as a FORMER democrat is that during the Obama presidency I remember seeing the right act like this. Watching republicans say the most hypocritical and moronic things and thinking wow democrats are better than this. But the Trump presidency had just proved me wrong. Left and right is all the same. Too ideological on both sides. Stop following so blindly America. "
'I really don’t understand what the problem with the president blocking people is?'
"I don't get it at all. They hate Trump yet they wanna follow him? Just to talk shit to him?\n\nAnd considering how much trolling they did they deserved to get banned. Don't know if this also applies to the POTUS though."
"Someone that's smarter than me please pitch in. If it becomes illegal for Trump to block users on Twitter. Which is not own by any goverment agency. Then shouldn't it be illegal for say a news website to have a paywall for us to see reporting on Trump. Shouldn't it work both ways? No idea how these laws work explain it like I am five if any of you have the time."
"I don't get it , a normal person can block ppl too or I'm wrong ? Why you won't allow him to block ppl ?"
'I\'m simply amazed at the sheer ignorance of everyone coming here and saying that Twitter should be held to the same standard as POTUS. I mean, I expect to see a few.. but it\'s like T\\_D had a fire sale in the "stupid comment" bin and everybody went a\'shoppin.\n\nLet me explain a couple things to you before you hit the "Send" button on your rage post.\n\n* Constitutional law applies to government entities, with this specific law referring to a public forum **CONTROLLED BY A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL**.\n* **Twitter is a** ***PRIVATE ORGANIZATION***. As such, it is allowed to set policies of it\'s own and has no requirement to follow Constitutional law \\- as long as it is not violating anti\\-discrimination laws it is allowed to refuse service to whoever it wants \\(and if someone feels they HAVE been discriminated against, they are fully within their right to [file a lawsuit against Twitter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/01/08/google-faces-a-lawsuit-over-discriminating-against-white-men-and-conservatives/?utm_term=.ede83e9d0ea2)\\). **The President of the United States is NOT allowed to do the same, regardless of what you might want or think**.\n* The judge ruled that **Donald Trump\'s** ***PERSONAL ACCOUNT*** **is considered a public forum** because he and administration personnel are in control of it and it is governmental information in context. Also, it has been fully accepted by the White House that the @realDonaldTrump account should be considered OFFICIAL PRESIDENTIAL CORRESPONDENCE.\n\nTo say that Twitter as a company "should be held as accountable" as Trump\'s account is ludicrous, and frankly it tells me that there are so many "patriots" that don\'t understand how the Constitution even works.\n\nAlso, maybe [actually READ the judgement](https://knightcolumbia.org/sites/default/files/content/Cases/Wikimedia/2018.05.23%20Order%20on%20motions%20for%20summary%20judgment.pdf). It fully explains why Trump\'s account should be considered a public forum, and what separates it from Twitter as a whole. If you disagree with the judgement, or the law, by all means say so \\- but to just blurt out shit like "*But Twitter does it too....*" is idiocy.'
"I don't understand why they give such a large amount of fucks over being blocked on Twitter..."
"What the fucking fuck? Lol...I can't even right now. I'm sitting here sputtering my coffee onto my phone. What the actual fuck is life anymore? Holy shit."

'Trump was able to (kinda miraculously) tread water for 558 days by throwing a bunch of outlandish shit at everybody, but I think the media is now done taking the bait. No more "haha he said covfefe" shit (even though the lights dimming yesterday now feels like it was done on purpose). We just need to be relentless on this shit. More and more protestors surrounding the White House/Maralago every day, please.'

'And about 2 days after trump was shown this evidence Russian officials started mysteriously dying. Coincidence?\n\nRemember “follow the trail of dead Russians”?'
'I am 100% certain that Trump knows that Russia interfered with the election.\n\nI am 100% certain that Trump--directly or indirectly--conspired with them.\n\nAnd I am 100% certain that Trump thinks he\'s innocent anyway, and that this is indeed all a "witch hunt."\n\nTrump rationalizes the bad things he does, thinking that everyone must be doing the same things.  If everyone does it then it\'s not really bad.  If everyone does it, then it\'s totally unfair that HE gets criticized and investigated for it.  So he\'s convinced it\'s a witch hunt, because he cannot possibly conceive the idea that maybe he\'s the bad guy and others aren\'t.'

'>Consider that if the memo is correct, there would be nothing wrong with Trump setting up a booth somewhere in Washington, DC where wealthy individuals could hand checks to Trump, and in exchange Trump would make whatever federal legal trouble they are in go it away.

When did he testify in the last two months?'
'All of this is just very strange to me. I\'d want people working for me to follow the law and company policy.

"No there isn't. His approval rate is nonstop growing. CNN stop. It's not working."
'Remember, the GOP can stop this madness whenever they want. '
"The worst thing you could ever do to a person like Trump is take away the things he loves most: power, money, and validation. Let the investigation take its course, let him get nailed to the wall, get him out of office, and have his remaining assets tied up in court long after he's died, broke with nobody to kiss his ass. he's too egotistical and narcissistic to realize that he's simply a mouthpiece for other people who are too self-aware to say the things he does publicly. once he doesn't hold the office of POTUS, they'll have no interest in him."
"The question is what will the conservative propaganda machine do if he ever is impeached? Across the board they toe the line, telling the same fantasies each day in effort to shape reality. From Fox to Drudge to Brietbart to talk radio they push the same angles every day. They've been caught coordinating with the White House since at least the Bush 43 days on message.

This fucking asshole has been a right wing fixture for like 30 years now. He was writing *books* about the Clintons murdering Vince Foster back in the early 90s. Do not let this go as some symptom of the Trump era. This motherfucker is part of the cancer that CAUSED the Trump era.'
'This is a common expression and not racially charged. If we are going to ignore context and cause a crisis over everything it makes it harder to point to legitimate discrimination.'
'Not that fact matters in today’s political discussion, but “cotton pickin” is a southern euphemism for damn and is associated with cotton picking, not slaves.\n\n> Early sources show the phrase being used to refer to anyone who picked cotton, not just black slaves. It was a reference the difficulty of the job, not the worker.'
'As someone who learned of the expression "cotton-picking" by watching Bugs Bunny cartoons as a child and only very recently learned that it has racial connotations, I think this may have been less racism and more like a poor choice of words.'
"I've been around republicans all my life... I know how they talk.  No amount of whining or crying about how they're being accused of racism falsely means anything... the proof is in the pudding.\n\nIf you haven't, TRUST ME... the racism and constant bigotry is fucking everywhere.  It's always on their minds, you'll be having conversations about nothing related to race, and they'll make it about minorities being pieces of shit (or somehow responsible for something they're tangentially talking about).   Not ALL of them, but a very large percentage of them.\n\nThis is what happens when you put someone who is like this and put them on camera.  They can't help themselves... they just can't.\n\n"
'Isn’t that just a phrase? Like wtf. I’m from New York and growing up it was a common enough phrase with no racial undertones at all. Why do people get triggered so easily over everything nowadays? It’s literally from a god damn cartoon ffs. Or at least that’s where i heard it first as a kid, on looney tunes '
'According to [this](https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/cotton-picking.html), the phrase "cotton-picking" differs from "cotton-picker", the latter of which was racist and the former referred to the difficulty of gathering the crop. In the south it\'s still used as a qualifier, like a replacement for "damn". It was even said by bug\'s bunny in old cartoons.\n\nNow the phrase is dying out among younger people (based on my personal experience living and growing up in the south), but plenty of people still say it as a way to add emphasis with no intended racial connotation. I\'m all for fighting against institutionalized racism, but the outrage over a phrase like this seriously boggles my mind. It isn\'t my brand of communication and hearing that phrase makes me think someone\'s a little too "country" for my liking, but otherwise who cares. \n\nWord meaning changes over time. Generationally, connotations get muddled, and many things can be broken down literally to mean something other than what was intended. Even in this thread, plenty of people are saying "oh I\'ve always heard that and it wasn\'t ever racist but yeah now I get it it\'s totally racist, whoever says that is so racist!" \n\nJust another stupid distraction imo '
'TIL telling someone they are out of their cotton-picking mind is racist. '

"Okay fine. Trump is entirely innocent of any collusion. He just happens to have by sheer coincidence hired multiple people who were definitely colluding on his behalf without his knowledge.\n\nSo... he's incompetent. Is that the conclusion? Because frankly it's one or the other. He's either guilty as shit or a dumb motherfucker. Now I don't particularly mind which one you choose, either one establishes the important fact. Trump is not fit to be president."
'No Collusion, no collusion, no collusion.\n\nThe only thing Trump has taught me over the past 14 months is that if he says it, IT IS NOT TRUE. '
"I feel kind of bad for this George Papadopoulos guy. He was a young dude, hustling to get a break into a position with a campaign, like a lot of other guys his age. If he had been with a normal campaign, they would have given him some low level work to do which he couldn't have gotten in trouble with, and that would have let him move up the rungs of the political scene. \n\nInstead, he got encouraged to do all the crazy shit that people who have no idea about legal boundaries think of, and now he has a criminal record and his association with this presidency hanging over his head from the rest of his life.

'Tyrant. The word is tyrant. And Trump wants tyranny –\xa0you know, that shit conservatives continually accused Obama of?'
'Remember when Trump supporters went bat-shit crazy on Twitter. Remember how they attacked NPR for "propaganda" against Trump when all they were doing was...get this: [**reciting the Declaration of Independence**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/07/05/some-trump-supporters-thought-npr-tweeted-propaganda-it-was-the-declaration-of-independence/?utm_term=.d16153f5aa7e)?\n\nApparently, there were too many similarities to ignore. Even to an untrained eye, Trump is a wannabe Tyrant. And his voters are wannabe-intellectuals. What a wicked web we weave when all we do is lie and deceive...'
'Out of curiosity, where are all the conservative "we need assault rifles to fight tyranny" people, now that we\'re *actually threatened with tyranny*?'
"The problem we have right now is no one is upholding the Constitution's system of checks and balances. The Founders predicted someone might try what Trump's doing, but Congress is supposed to step in and stop him. Unfortunately, party corruption can destroy any political system quickly."
"That's because he's everything that we said he was and worse.  I hate to be a smug asshole about this, but this wasn't a storm we didn't see coming.  Get the fuck out and vote.  Go to your congressman's local offices and camp out on the floor until they get the point.  This guy needs to go before he really does do some permanent damage."
'From the article:\n\nJames Madison, the essential author of the Constitution,\xa0counseled\xa0that “If the president be connected in any suspicious manner with any persons, and there be grounds to believe he will shelter himself; the house of representatives can impeach him: They can remove him if found guilty: They can suspend him when suspected, and the power will devolve on the vice-president: Should he be suspected also, he may likewise be suspended till he be impeached and removed…”\n\n“This,” explained Madison, “is a great security.”'
'His tweets this weekend are scary. Scary that not one Republican is standing up to this shit. '
'The fact that a republican congressional majority is turning its eyes away from Trumps abuses of power is all the proof you could need that there are no conservatives any longer. There are a few libertarians and then a bunch of proto-fascists on the right. If there was a real republican anywhere he or she would be ringing bells and screaming about exactly this point. Conservatives if they were at all consistent with their values would be way out front on this.'
"All hail King Donald! The Emperor that wears no clothes! Be careful of this f*&king moron (in the words of Rex Tillerson). He's pushing us closer and closer to fascism. He'd love to be ruler for life. Sounds good to him, right. \n\nThe moron is a commie sympathizer for God's sake. Isn't that enough? It's one thing to try to cozy up the Chinese. After all they own us, or at least a lions share of our debt. But to kiss ass with Putin is unthinkable. The Russians will never forget the snubbing from previous administrations. The Russian government (Putin) wants nothing more than to wreak havoc on the American way of life.  \n\nCome on folks. Isn't it obvious by now. The experiment failed. Failed miserably. IMPEACH TODAY!"
'He would rewrite the Constitution in a split-second if he could. I am sick of that rat bastard defiling all of the political culture.'
'He\'s revealing himself and his true intentions. Remember the few times he has "joked" about being "president for life"? He doesn\'t joke. He never laughs. We have to believe him when he shows us who he is.\n\nThis is going to get very messy. I expect he will be subpanoed, and simply refuse. After a year of wrangling eventually the supreme Court will weigh in and say he must submit to the subpoena. He will simply refuse. \n\nIn that year he will have avoided impeachment because, and this is the big one, republicans are going to maintain control of the house and senate. They will do this by 1) Providing zero protection against hackers and botnets seeking to influence the election and 2) confusing the mid term election process and throwing it into chaos by promoting the "voter fraud" lie. Trump is laying the groundwork with his tweet on "meddling". They will offer some way for certain areas that may flip blue to opt out of holding elections until the problem is rectified. \n\nThe problem will never be rectified, because it does not exist. He will stay in power with a congress and senate that refuse to impeach and are complicit. The imaginary voter fraud issues will get worse and worse, and aided by an army of hackers and bots, the idea of suspending the Presidential election will take hold.\n\nThis all sounds like a fantasy, but it\'s how you do it. This is a slow coup staged by right wing extremists and you are all watching it happen right now.'
"Just want to point out to anyone who thinks the constitution is outdated. If you think the constitution is outdated, that's like saying the first amendment only protects 17th century style printing presses. We've been under rule of a corporate Oligarchy for a long long time now, probably since right after the industrial revolution. Every president since has been merely a puppet for corporate, banking, and foreign interests. The borders of a first world nation(or a nation with several multi billion dollar industries - first/third world is kind of an outdated term) is just a joke considering who really owns these countries. A capitalist anywhere will want to outsource production to a place with cheaper labor. This is only fixed with interest and a system of credits and debits, but is ultimately doomed to fail someday, or inflate the currency so much that the working class inevitably becomes enslaved to the debt they're working for(already happening).\n  \nI've seen a rising trend of kids graduating early. Wouldn't be surprised if they lowered the full time working age in the future, and maybe some day having children or parents working to pay off things such as a vehicle and maybe state sponsored housing in the future for their children while they're still at home. It's already pretty much this way - it's looking like there's just going to be more Government mandated laws and restrictions to our social, political, geographic, personal, and economic rights going forward. The corporate funded Government we live under merely uses its right wing arm to overtly extended their agendas while using the left wing to infiltrate any movements that might arise as a reaction to the right wing. Just like a boxer uses its lead arm to jab and court the other boxer while it uses its other arm to throw KO punches. It uses the right as a jab and the left as a KO just IMO. \n  \nThe media hijacks all of these social movements and uses things like race and bigotry as a tool to manipulate people. The greatest trick of the oppressor is to turn those he's oppressing in the direction of each other, shielding him from any reprisals and keeping the masses distracted.. A good example is the Evergreen University IIRC(and many other colleges across the country) near Seattle that has become increasingly segregated and authoritarian. The students know that they're oppressed but the media indoctrinates them into thinking that the cops are racist or that anyone who questions the left especially, is considered a bigot. When you no longer want discourse or dialectical conversations with opposing parties and resort to nothing but name calling it is called *indoctrination.* This indoctrination of the left just fuels a massive fire and increases the numbers of the alt-right. Both sides have one thing in common - the radicals really feel that they're oppressed but they both channel their anger in the completely wrong direction. I suggest you read about what happened at Evergreen and read a little bit about how racism has been used as a tool for a long long time. The USA has no more democracy.. It is indeed an Oligarchy of corporate elites, elite banking interests, among many other industries who've been having their buddies in congress write in laws to the favor of their industry."

'I know he didn\'t know it was Russian flags being thrown at him but the thumbs up timing was goddamn hilarious\n\n**EDIT** [best pic I\'ve found](https://i.imgur.com/4vPQnjn.png)\n\n**EDIT 2** [Oh shit nevermind HD!](https://i.imgur.com/t9opbGd.png)\n\n**EDIT 3** Those of you at work with twitter blocked I did my best "Viral Thread" technique and ripped it off of ABC News\' twitter and [uploaded the incident it to streamable](https://streamable.com/zt7el) for you'
"Next news story: Political activist charged with assault for attacking president with a flag. \n\nHe should've gotten some paper towel rolls and put russian flag stickers all over and tossed them at him. "
'I have begun to wonder if any of this is hitting home with him and his family (trumps not mafia family(aka GOP)). \nAt this point I have to assume a few truths:\n\n1. He really thought this is how President Obama and the Dems governed. They made decrees and everyone had to follow them. AKA The Fox News Diet.\n\n2. He never wanted nor expected to win. He was really hoping to just bash Hillary for the next 4-8 years.\n\n3. Once he won, I truly think he thought everyone would love him the way he loves himself. \n\nAnd it is point three that has me wondering if he has the awareness to realize ~60% of this country hate him with a passion and vitriol that I have never seen or heard of a sitting president deal with.\nWe know he is a narcissist, so does this upset him? \n\nDoes he think it is the "Shadow Gov\'t" (Obama, Comey, Clinton, etc..) faking the hate?\n\nDoes he have the self awareness to be be truly bothered by it, further more does he have the knowledge of how the gov\'t works to realize that he has potentially sentenced his family to life in prison by becoming POTUS.\n\nIt has been said a million times on Reddit alone, if he had not become president all of his and his family\'s shitty ways would still be under the radar.\n\nDoes he think the GOP will save him?\n\nOr is he so dumb that he thinks it is just a few people that hate him, does he even think one person hates him?\n\nMan I hope with all of my heart and soul that Mueller is truly going to make this man regret his first ever anti-Obama Tweet!\n\nE: Words are tough!'
'Expect more of  this. \n\nThe American people don’t appreciate treasonous fools in the White House. '

"I'm surprised Trump didn't start saluting the Russian flag, that's his country, he betrayed the United States. Putin owns Trump. Notice that the one person Trump never crosses or says anything bad about is his lord and master Putin. He will scream at and insult gold star families, the handicapped, war heroes, federal judges, his own staff, his party's congressmen and senators, babies, children, Muslims, Mexicans, African Americans, our allies, and even ordinary people. But Donald Trump is Vladimir Putin's bend over bitch.  His slavish devotion to Putin is very suspicious. Putin has dirt on Trump or a Trump owes billions to the Russians. If I lived in Alaska I'd be worried Trump will sell it back to Russia. "
'About fucking time.  Let the rage and russian flags finally start flying.  \n\nThe Fox/Bannon crowd would have been doing this type of stuff vs. a Democrat 6 months ago.  \n\nTime to release the hounds on this treasonous administration.  Mueller can provide the facts and indictments as they get solidified for impeachment proceedings.  But the outrage should be unleashed now.\n\nThis guy needs a statue.  :]'
"ITT: Uranium One. \n\nGuys, accusing another person of treason is not a defense for a person's treason. It's literally the definition of whataboutism."
'Now this is how you protest. I get some edgelords here think that violence works but something like this will sway way more hearts and minds than a burnt cop car or physical violence. This dude is fucking awesome.'
"You should hear all the old bitches on Facebook. , they're all crying about how if no one should throw anything at the president of the United States and that has never happened before. They seem to have forgotten about Bush and shoes. "
"Maybe because it's late in the day but it's hard to tell who the Russian sympathizers in this thread are versus the ones mocking the Russian sympathizers. \n\nSorting by controversial has brought me strangeness today."
"No collusion yet several key Trump campaign officials have been indicted/ arrested or both. \n\nEdit: I see people saying that their charges are unrelated/ not specified towards collusion with Russia. That may be officially true at the moment, however, Manafort and Gates have been charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. While Papadopoulos and Flynn lied about their Russian connections before and during the election. This raises red flags about the integrity of Trump's campaign. Also, remember the Mueller Investigation is not over yet, no matter the House's premature closure of their investigation. \n\n https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/20/17031772/mueller-indictments-grand-jury "
'What upsets me about this is that a lot of people who are only partially informed won\'t know the difference between the House Investigation and the Special Council investigation. To them this will be vindication of the president.\n\nEDIT: I am by no means an expert on this. I\'m just a weird Australian who is moderately informed. Please correct me if I\'m wrong about any of this:\n\nBut to to those who asked, yes Mueller\'s investigation is completely separate from The House Intel Commitee.\n\nThe HIC Russia probe started before Mueller\'s investigation. It is - or is meant to be - a bipartisan investigation into Russian election interference. It is run by the Republican majority and the Dem Minority. Right from the start it has been plagued by partisan hackery. \n\nAs it stands there are several key witnesses not yet interviewed. The Republican Majority has willingly turned a blind eye to shitloads of evidence and ultimately, they ended the probe before even informing the Dem Minority. They blindsided them.\n\nThere\'s a pretty interesting statement from Dem Minority leader Adam Schiff\'s in regards to this.\n\nAs for Mueller, he was appointed by Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein in response to Comeys firing and the leaked memos. Mueller is a completely seperate entity from the House Intel Commitee. Rosenstein has stated he sees no reason to end the investigation so for now Mueller is safe.\n\nIt\'s worrying though in the sense that so many people - on both sides of aisle - will see the words "no collusion" which will stick and ultimately the damage is done.\n\nAnd ultimately Trump will exploit that for all it\'s worth. There\'s the possibility he could even use this to fire Rosenstein (who is the only one with the power to actual fire Mueller)'
'(Not)Cliffs Notes: The same group of Republicans behind lying and misrepresenting the Carter Page FISA Warrants in the Nunes Memo have announced they will soon be releasing a new memo lying about and misrepresenting Russian Interference. '
">**The report will go further and suggest that to the extent that any Russians acted on behalf of either candidate, it was for Hillary Clinton**. That contentious finding is included in the context of discussing the role of the Christopher Steele dossier that was compiled on behalf of an opposition research firm contracted by a law firm connected to the DNC and the Clinton campaign.\n\nMan ... how does Clinton do it all? I mean ... she's able to murder Seth Rich, run a pedophile sex-trafficking ring out of the basement of a pizza parlor, leak national secrets to terrorists, lie (and not get caught) about Benghazi through hearing after hearing, and now you're telling me she also had time to collude with the Russians? Incredible! /s"
'**Action plan** if this is used as a pretext to fire Mueller and his separate investigation which has so far indicted 19 individuals and three companies, and has gotten **five guilty pleas**..\n\nhttps://act.moveon.org/event/mueller-firing-rapid-response-events/search/'

'“I hate taking these people,” Trump said. “I guarantee you they are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people...” \n\nJFC--Everything he says is pure drivel.\n'
"Reading through Trump's dialogue makes me realize what a hellish job his translators must have trying to accurately convey his disjointed, half finished thoughts and ramblings to other world leaders."
'These transcripts are a fucking embarrassment. \n\nThe entirety of the conversations can be summed up as follows:\n\n"I don\'t like these deals, my predecessor made bad deals, I want to make better deals, you have to understand that these are terrible deals" \n\nNon stop blame shifting, and nothing of substance because he\'s too fucking stupid. \n\nTo all you Trump supporters, thank you so very much for this embarrassing stain on our country\'s history.'
"> TRUMP: We are like a dumping ground for the rest of the world. I have been here for a period of time, I just want this to stop. I look so foolish doing this. It [sic] know it is good for you but it is bad for me. It is horrible for me. This is what I am trying to stop. **I do not want to have more San Bernardino’s or World Trade Centers. I could name 30 others, but I do not have enough time.**\n\nOne of the San Bernardino killers was a US citizen, born in America. His wife was a permanent resident, not a refugee.\n\nThe majority of the 9/11 terrorists were from Saudi Arabia, which is not on Trump's travel ban.\n\nWhat exactly is he trying to stop?"
'> "This is going to kill me," he said to Turnbull. "I am the world\'s greatest person that does not want to let people into the country. And now I am agreeing to take 2,000 people."\n\nNope no narcissism there. Jesus christ, we\'re all fucked aren\'t we?'
"> “I hate taking these people,” Trump said. “I guarantee you they are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people” — an apparent reference to U.S. dairy farms.\n\n> Turnbull tried to salvage the deal, noting that the detainees were economic refugees who had not been accused of crimes. He explained that they were being denied entry into Australia because of a policy aimed at discouraging human smuggling.\n\n> “There is nothing more important in business or politics than a deal is a deal,” Turnbull said. “You can certainly say that it was not a deal that you would have done, but you are going to stick with it.”\n\n> **Trump only became angrier, saying the refugees could “become the Boston bomber in five years.”**\n\nThis guy really hates refugees doesn't he?"
"tl;dr summary of the deal maker at work...\n\n\n>Pena: We are not paying for the wall.  It goes against out dignity.\n\n>Trump: Well, I told the american people for like 2 years that Mexico will pay for it. We need to work something out or I'll look bad.\n\n\n>Pena: I understand, but we are not paying. Let's stop talking about this stupid wall.\n\n>Trump:  Let's just say we are working on something? \n\n\n>Pena: We are not paying.\n\n\n>Trump: Come on...Can you at least not say that publicly? Media is going to kill me.\n\n>Pena: Let's not talk about the wall. \n\n\ndem Negotiation skills."
"These are incredible.\n\nI think that what will best turn Trump's voters is evidence that he is a pathetic little shit. These transcripts demonstrate that. He's not a strong negotiator--he's a grovelling little baby."

I will say it just that way. As far as I am concerned that is enough Malcom [sic]. I have had it. I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous. \n\nWhat a whiny little *bitch.*'

Fuck you, Trump and fuck you America for enabling this piece of horrific shit to be elected.\n\nhttp://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/australia-will-not-be-bullied-malcolm-turnbulls-blunt-warning-on-mh17-20151014-gk92fs.html\n\nEdit 3: As a Dutchman, let me quickly extend my love to any Australians here.. we haven't forgotten. We'll be at your side when it comes to Russia. We will not ever let this go."
"These leaks come at a huge cost. For one thing, US allies shouldn't have to worry abut full transcripts being leaked to be picked apart and used as fodder in their own domestic press. They also tell us nothing that we didn't already know (Trump is hopelessly dumb/uninformed, is actually a terrible negotiator, we're paying for the wall, he had a tantrum with Turnbull).  \n\nWe knew all of this already so these leaks don't even give us new info. Seriously, leaking transcripts of the president's calls to world leaders shouldn't be something we're cheering. "
">Up in New Hampshire – I won New Hampshire because New Hampshire is a drug-infested den – is coming from the southern border.\n\nThis bullshit statement shows Trump's inability to form a complete thought.  \n\nWhat?  What is up in New Hampshire?  The den came up from the southern border?  Of New Hampshire?  So then the southern border of New Hampshire?  Massachusettes?  Massachusetts is where the drug dens came from?  You won New Hampshire?  What happened to the fact that you didn't win New Hampshire?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?  This marble mouthed idiot needs to just stop talking.\n\nEdit:  \n\n>The powers of taxation are tremendous for the President of the United States and if you study that you will see what I mean.\n\nHe's telling someone else to study?  Am I being punked?  Is Rod Serling narrating something, that I can't hear?\n\n>We cannot say that anymore because if you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that.\n\nCan anyone please diagram that sentence for me?  I'm at a total loss."
"There's so much to choose from, but Trump's assumption here is particularly cringe-worthy to me. Ugh.\n\n>TRUMP\nWhat is the thing with boats? Why do you discriminate against boats? No, I know, they come from certain regions. I get it.\n\n>TURNBULL\nNo, let me explain why. The problem with the boats it that you are basically outsourcing your immigration program to people smugglers and also you get thousands of people drowning at sea."
'>But you cannot say that to the press. The press is going to go with that and I cannot live with that. You cannot say that to the press because I cannot negotiate under those circumstances.\n\n"It\'s hard for me to tell the suckers who voted for me you\'ll pay if you say you wont. I was likely just going to tell them you did anyway. They believe anything"'
"The transcripts only reaffirm that Trump is petulant, uninformed, distracted fool with the negotiating leverage of a lamb in a kebab factory.\n\nThis arrogant nincompoop couldn't negotiate his way out of a unlocked toilet stall. \n\n"
'> "I hate taking these people. I guarantee you they are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people."\n\nHe is referring to people that are economic refugees in this statement.  The only reason these people are in prison is due to an Australian immigration policy that\'s aimed at preventing human trafficking.  These people aren\'t criminals, and no part of this agreement is intended to let criminals into the US or AU, these people are just being held in a prison due to their immigration status.  Trump wants to act like they\'re all "bad hombres" because clearly the piece of dirt you\'re born on determines your goodness as a human being.  What a xenophobic piece of shit.'
"I.. don't want him speaking with any more world leaders. Holy shit. That was hard to read. "
"As always... there's a Trump Tweet for everything\n\n[Thank you to Prime Minister of Australia for telling the truth about our very civil conversation that FAKE NEWS media lied about. Very nice!](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827480386120929280)"
"Holy shit. He's describing in detail to the Mexican president how the wall doesn't matter at all and is just bullshit propaganda, and how he's going to deflect and lie to the American people about how it's being funded. Holy balls. You couldn't be more transparently fraudulent than this ."
'"The problem isn\'t that he speaks incoherently, is a terrible negotiator, and is weakening our alliances and economic stability,  it\'s that these darn leakers keep telling the American people about it!"\n\n-White House spin doctors, probably.'

"> He added: “Though I can say that those continuing to throw about unsubstantiated allegations related to Trump-Russia need to be prepared for legal action and Congressional investigations.

'What an incredible tie in this would be. It would be the exhaust port in the Death Star. '
"Just gonna throw this out there: I've read maybe 2 or 3 dozen comments with thoughts/theories.  Nearly all sourced.  Most of those sourced have *many* sources.  The witch hunt theory is, if it ever wasn't, absolutely out of the window.\n\nNow, focusing on the depth of this investigation:  there are ties all over linking many conservative groups or individuals.  Most are not going to go without a fight.  They are going to make this ugly.  I think America needs to have its big boy pants at the ready, for I see metric tons of shit going down within a few months. "
'Kill the NRA.'
'Can we do this kind of digging into all election monies?\n\nSaudi Arabia has been owning American politicians forever and journalists never dig this hard into them...\n\nAlso, is this illegal or just untoward? Because most of the political spending done is untoward.'
"That piece of garbage LaPierre who runs the NRA definitely knows about this and is probably implicated; explains why he was talking shit about the Federalis the other day.\n\nCan't wait for Muller to bag his bitch ass"
'If there was just a rumor that some group like the ACLU or the Sierra Club accepted money from a foreign power and used it to fund a Democrat’s campaign, even if was just from some week-old twitter account quoted in a Breitbart article, the Republicans would be foaming at the mouth over it and trying to put the group on a terrorist watch list and censor or impeach the recipient.  But this, this they are just going to dismiss out of hand.'
'Money is fungible (\\*) and therefore if the NRA receive any foreign funds whatsoever then they spent foreign funds electing Trump.\n\n(\\*) For my first witness to establish this fact I call the GOP, who continually cry about the fungibility of money whenever Planned Parenthood spends no government funds on abortion.'

'This is a VERY dangerous line of thought. It represents the total lack of empathy that this administration and its supporters have adopted.

Civilian casualties? "These aren\'t our kids". One of our allies gets invaded or attacked? "These aren\'t our kids". These seem like outlandish examples now, but with this as an excuse morality could very well be removed as a factor of the decision making of this government.'

'Of all the people that needs to be locked up it is Prince.  He is James Bond villain evil.  '
'Although I suspect Erik is more locked down in his personal security than Trump or Cohen, et al, I bet this will be interesting, to say the least. I sincerely hope for a felony conviction of this heartless mercinary so he can never get clearance again.'

"> Mr. Porter, who resigned last month amid a domestic abuse scandal, told Mr. McGahn the president had suggested he might “get rid of” Mr. McGahn if he chose not to challenge the article, the people briefed on the conversation said.\n\nThat's straight up lie or be fired.

'It must be exhausting having the part time job of obstructing justice. \n\nTrump is fucked.  I\'m calling it.  He\'s going to get "indicted" by Mueller.  I say "indicted" as in there\'s going to be a LAUNDRY list of crimes that Mueller accuses him of if you know what I mean.  Not formally indicted because I\'m not sure you can do that to a sitting pres.  And this is going off all the things we know IN PUBLIC.  \n\nGod knows what kind of shit Trump has tried in the background, behind closed doors...'

The president told Mr. McGahn that he did not remember the discussion that way.\n\nThen he gaslighted McGahn, his own legal adviser."
'>In one episode, **the president told an aide that the White House counsel, Donald F.

Mr. **McGahn never released a statement and later had to remind the president that he had indeed asked Mr. McGahn to see that Mr. Mueller was dismissed,** the people said.\n\nThis is the meat of the article, IMO.  Telling your WH counsel to issue an official statement lying for the president is very bad!'
"Every single day is multiple new scandals.  This is so insane.  Anyone still supporting this idiot needs to be locked away in an asylum for the rest of their life, because they're clearly a threat to society."
'So Trump interrogated people after they spoke to Mueller about what he asked and they said. \n\n\nAnd then he had people release public statements to contradict those statements. \n\nLMAO does Trump even KNOW there is a crime called obstruction of justice?'
"None of this matters and he will get away with everything if the Republicans stay in office. These Trump teet suckers plan on basically closing the current intel house investigation and opening up a second investigation against the FBI and you guessed it.... Hillary's emails. Shit you not.

Regardless, this was more than six months into the investigation, and Trump still can't stop doing obviously stupid things. "
'I think with this story we can all but conclude that Donald Trump is the kind of man who shits with the door open.'
"Trump seems to believe that the consequences of getting caught here are as meaningless as the consequences of getting caught in anything else he's ever been caught doing. When he finally realizes he's totally fucked to prison, that face he'll make.... that face... \n\nTHAT face should be the official portrait of the 45th president of the United States. The portrait of a sniveling fucking criminal with terrible vocabulary who's entire hometown knew he was a crook 40 years before he ran for president."

The president told Mr. McGahn that he did not remember the discussion that way.\n\nI'm taking this as confirmation that McGahn testified to Mueller that Trump tried to shit can him "
"I know Mueller is incredibly skilled, after all. He was the former Director of the FBI, he was a Stanford professor, he's definitely a smart and capable investigator.\n\nBut does he have to be? Why bother appointing a skilled and responsible investigator when Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys could probably find evidence of Trump's guilt? Literally anyone could nail Trump to the wall when Trump himself seems to have no regard for his actions. \n\nAt this point, I won't be happy if Trump simply resigns. He should do hard time. Running for president was always just a game to him, he's never considered that there was a worse outcome than him simply returning to his previous life as a billionaire scumbag. Some jail time would make him realize that you can't subvert the integrity of the United States by serving as Commander-in-Chief while colluding and working with Russia.  "
"I think Trump actually has affluenza. He's never faced real consequences of anything because of his money. His reality doesn't include anything being his fault or having to pay a price for bad behavior. He's a spoiled brat."
"But he is innocent , right? why the fuck he doesn't testify or whatever and clean his name? why the fuck ? fucking trump dude , i bet he was bullied in college. "

'It wasn\'t just an investigation, it was the **ONLY** Republican talking point for months and months during the campaign. They\'d talk and talk about "Lock her up" and all kinds of heinous crimes she supposedly committed, of course, but they kept that shit well clear of the main stage because they knew it was utter, dog-whistle horseshit and would wither and die in the light of day.'
"This is among the least of Trump's offenses and it's outrageous anyway."
"Of course it should, but the Republicans are such disgusting, asshole sucking pieces of shit that it wouldn't ever occur to them to hold a Republican to the same standard they hold a Democrat.  How is this even a question?  No one is confused about why the Republicans act like the huge pussies that they do."
"FUCK his phone, what are we doing? The man never expected to be president, his team of cronies was committing crimes of corruption, embezzlement and collusion so brazenly because the whole thing was a push to bolster his brand so they could license his name for towers in moscow and saudi arabia. It was business as usual for the trump crime family, until they actually had to put up or shut up, and now they've been shitting themselves nonstop for two straight years.  This whole fucking thing is a shitshow. We need to keep our heads on straight and see the forest for the trees - of fucking COURSE they're being hypocritical about his phone, they're being hypocritical about his fucking HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS \n\nFOCUS PEOPLE"
"Keep in mind, they might say both sides are the same, all the time, but they don't actually mean it.\nThey only mean it when a republican gets caught doing something bad. When a leftist (I think that's what they're calling them these days) gets caught doing the same thing it's the end of the fucking world. "
'So then by transitive property, are we saying that even if they "find evidence" of lawbreaking, no prosecutor will push the case, as Comey said under oath was the case for Clinton? Seems like a dangerous comparison to make considering H.Clinton got off with no charges....'
'Maybe if Trump had more apps on his iPhone - a few games, Amazon, Netflix etc, it would keep him from tweeting so much crap. \nI used to use the distraction technique with my toddlers it works a lot of the time!'
"Yeah but if Clinton's crime was ignored because she is part of the elite than i guess the same should go for Trump right?  So why bother to begin with?"
"According to the article, Trump's phones are government-issued from the White House's own IT department.\n\nWas Hillary's private e-mail server issued to her by the State Department?\n\nWhat a ridiculous article. \n\n99% of the top-voted comments are under the impression Trump is using his own personal phone and not a government-issued phone. What an embarrassing circle-jerk of mindless fools."
"I hate it when the obvious gets put out there like this and yet an investigation will never happen because D's and R's are held to completely different standards.\n\nSay it with me.  Its not about Hilary's emails, its that she is a Clinton and has a D after her name.  NOTHING ELSE.\n\nYeah it completely sucks that Obama gets harassed for his golfing and Hair Fuhrer coasts on by....\n\nBut again, R's and D's are held to completely different standards and the activities have to first pass the R or D litmus test to determine whether or not they are worth pursuing..\n\nHe was sleeping with a porn star?  Republican or Democrat...Republican?  Well we have other things to worry about..\n\nHe slept with a legal age intern?  Republican or Democrat?  Democrat..well impeach.."
"Can't wait for blue mid terms to rain Fire and Fury onto all the explosive swamp gas that these assholes deserve.\n\n\nFucking Trumpassbitches."

'"My IQ is one of the highest — and you all know it! Please don\'t feel so stupid or insecure; it\'s not your fault." - Donald J. Trump. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/332308211321425920?lang=en\n'
"Did Hillary mention how she stored classified info on that server?\n\nDid Hillary mention how she didn't comply with subpoenas or FOIA requests by deleting emails?\n\nDid Hillary mention how she destroyed blackberries and iPads with a hammer?\n\nOr did she try to compare the two events as equal?"
"Hillary Clinton has got to have a wall full of holes in her house, from where she keeps punching it in frustration every time a new piece of information like this comes out.\n\nSeriously, it's ridiculous how she was constantly hammered for all of this bullshit by the GOP, and now they're mum about everything Trump is doing. It's honestly infuriating. They'd have impeached her in February if she did everything Trump did in those first few weeks. And if not, they'd definitely have gotten rid of her by now."
'Is it stupidity? Arrogance? Or combination?\n\nSurely, it would eventually be known if trump staffers were using personal email addresses for work\n'
'What can you even say? She’s right, unfortunately, living in the South, I can tell you that many of my friends who voted Trump cannot see any fault in anything he ever does. No matter the amount of hypocrisy and damage he has done, they cannot seem to admit to themselves that he is a failure as POTUS and dangerous to the country.\n\nI find this intriguing to say the least, and I hope one day someone can explain this effect, it’s almost like a cult. '
"It may be hypocrisy but it's also the logical outcome. If you demonstrate that there is zero penalty for breaking the rules and using a private email server, public officials are bound to do it anytime they want to avoid public scrutiny. If Hillary actually faced legal rather than just political consequences, public officials might be a little more hesitant in following her example. "
"That and calling a former POW who is battling brain cancer a 'disgrace' (among other things) while attacking NFL players for disrespecting our military is the absolute height of hypocrisy I have seen from any president during my lifetime."
'Except you know... lying under oath, private servers you failed to tell anyone about, transmitting and receiving classified information, keeping copies of those emails on computer of individuals with no privilege to see them, and attempting to erase your tracks when a congressional subpoena was issued for them... yeah, it’s exactly the same. '
'I feel like this entire whirlwind of horror has taught me that a Republican never says anything in good faith. All of their outrage is completely fake and manipulative. I mean individuals too, my own family has pretty much shown me I wasted 100% of my time ever entertaining their political beliefs and arguing politics because their current silence on this crap only proves it was for show'
"Of course she doesn't mention that the situations are completely different because she built an email server in her own house, run by Clinton foundation techs without security clearances, and sent classified info over it. Far worse than what the trumps are accused of, dishonest as fuck"
"My response to this is that I'm fine with whatever reaction you have as long as its consistent. \n\nDid you feel that Clinton's emails were a massive scandal? Then you should feel similarly about the recent revelations regarding the Trump administration.\n\nDid you feel that the Clinton email scandal was massively overblown? Then you should feel these recent revelations aren't a big deal, either. \n\nAnd you can fall anywhere in between, of course: the point is to avoid an obvious double standard. "
"This really just shows how out of touch Hilary was, generally most of the public who turned on her were not offended that she used a private email address.   It was the fact that she deleted so many emails for some reason, lied about it then lied about not knowing they were classified.    It looked a lot worse then just simply being stupid enough to use a private email address. \n\nI stand corrected if this is the case with these republicans in question but I don't think they have been shown to mysteriously delete emails then lie about it yet?\n\nI apologize in advance to anyone in the reddit community who is triggered by someone speaking about anyone in the republican party with anything but disdain. "
'Not at all a Trump fan... but everything Clinton is saying and doing is about her election loss, instead of the shitstorm the american people are in right now. \n\nI\'m sure a lot of it is because the media asks her those specific questions, but she has to do a better job of shifting the focus onto policy issues that are hurting the people, and how she and the dems plan to fight that. Especially now... with the fucked up situation puerto rico is in, this should be an easy "pivot".\n\nAnd we all get it .... you\'re sad you lost the election, but you\'re a multi millionaire. You will be OK. You don\'t have to worry about the rent, or your medical bills, or student loans. So... its hard for me to feel too much sympathy for you.'
'Wait, Kushner had a mail server in his basement that he used to process top secret information? And then he failed to turn over that information under both FOIA requests and federal subpoena? And then he repeatedly lied about the scope of the system and the sensitive information it handled?\n\nWow, just as bad as Hillary.'
'This is one thing that bothers me most about this administration. It\'s not just that we have disagreements, people are actually defending a group doing things that are basically what most people would learn is wrong from their parents growing up. I\'ve never seen such "morally flexible" people in my life, if it does something to benefit them they don\'t give a shit who or how many it hurts. As someone who feels guilty if I smash a damn bug in my house i\'m just flabbergasted by this behavior.'
'It is the plight of the Democrat.  They are expected to be absolutely perfect and prim politicians that still need to maintain a personality that could get them elected.  They are held to a higher standard and receive significantly more criticism than if a Republican did the same thing. \n\nTake for instance the presidential debates.  The only expectation people had for Trump was for him to not call Hillary and bitch or a cunt.  '
'Worst is most of those who call her a "criminal" because of her e-mails have absolutely no idea of why using a private server for government business is not a good idea. '

"I'm finally starting to see it guys. All my life I've heard about the American spirit, that there's just something that sets Americans apart.\n\nAs one of your neighbours to the north (yup, we spell neighbors with a u) I've spent years rubbing my eyes and scratching my head trying to figure out what makes people think America is so special and this investigation has started to sharpen the fuzzy image.\n\nThis man, the most powerful man in the world surrounds himself with loyal dogs willing to take a fall for him. He lies and cheats and slinks his way to the top. He makes a mockery of the electoral system and embarrasses the establishment while backstabbing all the the people who carried him to where he is.\n\nBut, if I may borrow your national sport for a moment. You're in the bottom of the 9th, down 9-4, and you STILL KEEP FUCKING SWINGING.\n\nSo the other team thinks they already won, but America is still there swinging that fucking bat and step by step, single by single, you start to crawl back.\n\nNext thing your opponents know they're looking at a tied scoreboard with bases loaded wondering how the hell they lost their lead and it's because you Americans have something in your culture that not a lot of cultures have.\n\nYou guys have tenacity.\n\nI honestly don't think you guys know how to give up.\n\nAnd now you're watching the system you built working how it was designed. It's not fast, it's not perfect, but it's a self-righting ship that's just been through a hurricane.\n\nCongress and Senate blocking executive agendas. Judges blocking executive overreach. Law enforcement cutting out the infected tissue to save the body.\n\nHonestly America, I never really saw it before, but your country really is something special."
"That's *got* to be a misquote. No one's dumb enough to give loyalty to someone as dumb and unscrupulous as Trump unless they're using him for something, right?"
'Trump\'s loyalty meetings:  "which one of you motherfuckers is loyal enough to lie to the FBI for me so you go to jail and I don\'t?"\n\nstupid shitheads, all of them.  trump is a user of people and they\'re lining up to be used by him.  they\'re toilet paper to him.  he\'s no one, he has nothing.  what is wrong with them?  were they all so unwanted as children that Trump is the father they look up to?  what the hell, ya\'ll'
'From one of his contractors before the election. “We knew he was cheating people, but we didn’t think he was cheating us.”'
"Still can't believe they tried lying to the FBI, either really dumb or doing some really bad stuff, or both.  The FBI could probably figure out what your first goldfishes name was if they really wanted to."
'This is more evidence of obstruction of justice. Firing Comey for refusing to give Trump the “loyalty” he asked for directly led to his firing. Trump knew Comey was going to investigate Trump’s vast social, media, and financial ties to Russia, and Trump fired him for not sweeping it then under the rug.'
'Keep turning the screws, boys!  The Death Star explosion is coming!  💥 '
'You gotta be a stupid bitch and a bad person to give your loyalty to trump. '
"This is what Trump wants. Every person who works for him is willing to lie for him because that is what loyalty to Trump is. Lying on his behalf. Ergo anyone who works for Trump is a liar. If they weren't, Trump would have fired them."
'Ohh lying to the FBI will get you in prison. Just ask Martha Stewart, thats the charge she got hemmed up on.'
'Well well well. The "conspiracy" is proving more true every week, lol. Its sad what you can get away with when you have $$$. The idea of capitalism sounds great, but is definitely not without flaws. Assholes like these can get away with whatever as long as their rich friends and politicians are getting their slice of pie. Fuck all the little people who actually make this country work. Its just so frustrating. I can only laugh at this popadopalous guy. That\'s what you deserve for supporting a piece of shit like Trump. Of course he\'s gonna hang you out to dry to save his own ass. You dont mean shit to him and he doesn\'t give two craps about what happens to you. How stupid can you be to believe Trump would risk himself to look out for you.'

'Ok, ok, ok. Let\'s take a step back and be objective for a second here (which, admittedly, as a Canadian, I\'m finding it harder and harder to do).\n\nThe US President has just attended an international conference with his closest allies, both economically and geopolitically, and threatened to stop trading with them if they don\'t concede to his demands on trade.\n\nThis US President, both prior to and at said conference, indicated that Russia, who had been removed (almost) unanimously from the conference for an illegal invasion of a sovereign nation, should be present because he feels they should be. \n\nThis is the same Russia which the US and international intelligence community has repeatedly and emphatically stated interfered in the 2016 US election to help swing the result in favour of the current US President. The same Russia which the intelligence community states is currently undermining democracies around the world. The same Russia which has publicly poisoned former citizens currently residing on foreign soil. The same Russia this US President has repeatedly dragged his feet on imposing sanctions upon. The very same Russia which is currently the subject of a Special Council investigation into this President\'s possible collusion with them, which has already resulted in indictments and guilty pleas.\n\nThen, this US President has indicated in a tweet that the Canadian tariffs on US dairy are unjust and that "we should end all subsidies because they\'re unfair" despite the fact that the US dairy and agriculture industries are massively subsidized and the primary reason behind the Canadian tariffs in the first place. He then refuses to sign a joint statement by all members of the conference because he feels the Canadian Prime Minister made false statements. \n\nThe US President then states that the current tariffs his nation is placing on his allies is justified from a national security risk assessment perspective because they jeopardize the US "balance sheet" despite the fact that he has signed a elaborate tax overhaul which grants massive benefits to the wealthy and corporations and will increase the US debt by 1.5 trillion over the next decade.\n\nI mean, I know we talk a lot here about this season having the craziest writing and that this is all nuts and beyond the norm, but I sometimes feel we\'re not only losing sight of the forest for the trees, but losing sight of the galaxy for the grains of sand on the beach.\n\nRegardless of who this US President is, this is beyond comprehension. He is actively promoting the interests of a hostile foreign power, one for which his campaign\'s involvement is currently being investigated, while simultaneously attacking his closest allies using blatant falsehoods and ludicrous hypocrisy.\n\nAnd this isn\'t some shitty TV drama. This is actually happening. In real life. Right now.\n\nI\'ve lost the proper vocabulary for how insane...yes UTTERLY INSANE...this entire thing is. \n\nEdit: forgot that Italy was opposed to Russia\'s expulsion from the group for the 2014 Crimea annexation.'
'This would collapse the entire world economy.\n\nIs he insane? Congress needs to act now.'
'Old allies: Canada, England, France, Japan\n\nNew allies: Russia, North Korea\n\nWelcome to the Axis of Evil '
'Would a Republican please use a cogent argument as to why threatening our allies this way is a good thing?\n\nAnyone up for the challenge?\n\nBecause I see an idiot threatening to destroy decades of trust and economic stability for....?'

Other governments try to balance themselves at least somewhat responsibly? America comes along and pops the balloon, everyone suffers. I am enraged. There is no shining city on the hill, and y’all as citizens are not informed or active enough to bring sense into the worlds largest superpower.

He first got concessions from them for his personal business practice, and then he threw a bone to that chinese phone company.\n\nPay2Play is NOT OK.  \n\nImpeach the payola president."
'What kills me is there are people who fucking wanted this.  Who said "God I hate politicians, I want someone the complete opposite!  Drain the swamp!".  This is what they get.  They would rather fucking jerk the wheel so hard the car goes into a ditch because they didn\'t like the direction it was being traveled.  They choose someone completely incompetent at diplomacy to be head diplomat of our country who then goes on to alienate all our allies and humiliate us on the world stage.\n\nIt\'s a dark fucking time to care about policy.  Not even republicans who care about policy over personality could possibly want this in a million years.'
'"  He framed his trade attacks as a defense of U.S. national security, citing the weakening of the country’s “balance sheet” as the corresponding threat. "\n\nDidnt stop him from blowing up the balance sheet by giving TRILLIONS away to corporations and Republican donors. Where the fuck is Congress? '
'Hell hath no fury like a baby with an overflowing diaper.'
'Look, any student of history knows that protectionism doesn\'t work. It stokes up animosity based on arbitrary lines on a map, causes hyperinflation and allows discord to ferment in the general population. The result is an angry populous whose money is worth little and has no access to basic necessities so has to go to war with the "other" to fight for resources. It\'s clear that the end game of the America First movement is a racist wasteland where the only right that is guaranteed is access to guns. I truly hope it\'s not too late to start protesting. Good luck America. '
'Firstly, the "average tariff" figures in the article are a bogus comparison, because they do not account for the US\' hefty government subsidies for the majority of its export industries, and its agricultural subsidies are one of the most egregious examples. \n\nSecondly, it also ignores the fact that transborder *services* carry no tariffs. While Canada has a slight edge in its *goods* balance of trade with the US, once services are added up, the US is actually running a *trade surplus* with Canada, and the article\'s "average tariff" comparison goes out the window.\n\nBut back to my first point, the existence of unfair US subsidies: fully 75% of the average American farmer\'s or rancher\'s revenue comes from federal and state subsidies, rather than from actual sales. In most cases, these subsidies allow US Big Agriculture to sell its wares at *substantially* below actual input costs. \n\nThis is one of the key reasons why food in the US is so dirt-cheap at the retail level, and comparatively dear in Canada: Canada has no production subsidies, so Canadian food producers need to charge enough for their product to not just cover costs, but to actually *make a profit* - unlike their US competitors. \n\nSo it\'s no wonder, considering that US milk producers get three free dollars from the US Treasury for every dollar of milk they sell, that Canada wants to claw back $2.75 in duty, for every dollar of subsidized US dairy shipped over the border; it simply wants to neutralize the US government\'s subsidies, and level the playing field for its own producers in the marketplace. What\'s so unfair about *that*?\n\nSecondly Trump just gave away his previous lies by admitting that the US tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum had nothing to do with "national security", but was in fact, retaliation for tariffs on inferior American dairy goods and other exports blocked by the Canadian, NAFTA-compliant yield management system - most elements of which have now been in place for more than fifty years. Hell, they were even negotiated *directly into* the pre-NAFTA CUSFT agreement, back in \'87, and signed by Ronald Reagan - a hero to American farmers.\n\n\nThirdly, Trump wonders why Canada doesn\'t want to allow its domestic producers to be destroyed by US Big Dairy dumping its surplus, grotesquely subsidized, inferior, steroid-soaked, hormone-saturated milk into Canadian markets at substantially below their actual production costs.\n\nFourthly, unlike Trump\'s blatantly nationalist-pandering initiative to supplement the three-hundred-odd trade walls the US *already* has in place on industrial metals, by raising *even more* artificial barriers to fight domestic competiton for steel and aluminum, *food security* IS DEFINITELY a key element of national security. And Canada has every right to defend the security of its domestic food supply against the illegal, below-cost dumping of unfairly subsidized and inferior foreign product - originating either in the US, or elsewhere.'
"First he floated ending the tariffs, now he want to stop all trade with allies? Because it's...profitable? What the fuck? He's off his rocker. Really. What is going on in his head."
"You dumb fucks voted for this asshole - YOU figure out how you want to handle him.\n\nI've had e-fucking-nough."
"Translation: Trump intends to cut off America's own nose to spite Her face because the other world leaders refuse to blow sunshine up his ass while giving a handjob to Putin."
'whats most pathetic is that they don\'t want to change their minds about him no matter what *just* so they can say stupid platonic bullshit like "these colors don\'t run" when the reality is much simpler. you made a terrible fucking mistake, are horribly misinformed, get your information universe from a horse\'s asshole, and live in a world where you think it\'s ok for a President to behave like this. He\'s definitely a traitor. I don\'t know about anyone else, but as soon as he\'s convicted, I\'m heading to Washington to watch as the people cheer when he and his family are put in prison for life.'
"Right now, as I'm writing this comment, the G6 leaders are starting the process of realigning their trade agreements. The CEOs and COOs of international corps are reassessing their supply chains. I think they'll err on the side of caution and favour non-US sources for the foreseeable future. It took Trump less than 17 months to sink the biggest economy in the history of the planet. Oranges and corn syrup might cost me more in the future, but hey, I can eat apples and honey instead. The only thing that pisses me off about this is that I know some of Trumps cronies will make a killing shorting stocks on the markets."

'It never ever seems to have an end. There is no bottom too low for the GOP. I’m disgusted. Traitors! Every damn one of them are traitors to our Constitution. It breaks my heart.'
'I\'m actually really curious about this as it seems to be a different tactic that McConnell in the Senate.  McConnell, by my read, is trying to head off a situation where Republicans will have to take a formal stance on a highly controversial issue (protecting Mueller, and to a less extent Rosenstein).\n\nThe actions in Congress however seem to be driving a similar confrontation to a head.\n\nNote that the Committee can push a privileged resolution for contempt to the house floor, but the entire house must vote on it.  With how vulnerable the house is already to flipping Dem, it really seems like a bad play for Ryan to let this come to the floor.\n\nSo the big question is, is this a bluff?  Are the committee Republicans trying to get a hold of the documents for the reasons listed in the article, and will fold if Rosenstein comes up with a "reasonable" reason to refuse, or will they push for a full house vote to push for Contempt if he refuses, which will setup a public show down that, again, I cannot image the House leadership wants.'

"How a good chunk of our country is oblivious to all this or just don't care boggles the mind, it's saddening and frustrating.  People are proud of their ignorance as long as it pisses off everyone who isn't a republican."
'Firing Mueller would be the single dumbest thing Trump does at this stage in the game. He shouldve fired him months ago and the damage control wouldve been much easier. At this point It would unleash hell. Mueller has been preparing since day one to get fired. You dont think there are back ups built in NY for indictments? There are already sealed documents floating about. The trap is laid, and if the Don fires Mueller its checkmate on donnie because the gloves come off, people will be in the streets and then all of the real evidence can be presented because it is a constitutional crisis.'
'No shit. Republicans are treasonous dicks. '
'The GOP is gleefully killing American Democracy. They are a cancer, unfit to govern, and every last one of them need to be voted out of office.'
"Why have no GOP congress members been indicted?  There is no doubt they're committing crimes.  I've never been so disgusted with this country in my life.  "
"Look at where the investigation has led Mueller? Right into the GOP's coffers.\n\nTheir embracing of Trump in order to gain control of all branches of government has literally resulted in their sources of money being investigated, and Mueller is finding shit in there.\n\nHad they rejected Trump no one would have known.\n\nSo now the cockroaches are all in a panic at the possibility of being outed for the fucking traitors they are.\n\nHence, where we are now."
'America is so messed up. I\'m constantly amazed at how my republican friends are so "we\'ve got it so hard, everyone hates us, the media hates us, everyone is against us" when they "own" all three branches of government. \n\npathetic. '
'To save their own hide. They are up to their gills in Russian and black money. And the Russian hack of the GOP likely returned damning data regarding their anti poor and minority platform that they would not like the public to know about. They must obstruct justice or be caught. They have to destroy democracy to preserve their position.'
'I still find this strange given how the majority of them thought Trump was the worst case scenario to their primary.'
"They all need to be charged with obstruction, in the least, possibly conspiracy. Their hindering a criminal investigation. I don't know what else you could call this."
'They simply don’t want to be faced with incontrovertible proof that their president is a criminal, actively committing crimes in the White House, and possibly even a traitor. If that happens, they HAVE to act, but that would simply hurt their poll numbers with their base and they’re cowards. \n\nIt’s absolutely shameful. '
'I would introduce a legal name change for Mitch fucking McConnell. Rename him to reflect what he is, call him; "state cancer", or "senate syphilis", or "mud face Mitch McCrupt", or "deep state herpes", or "dung democracy dweep". Both Ryan and this twat should be fed to a graphite inferno.'
'Why the heck are people so obsessed with Trump?  The man is the worst human being on the planet.  Who wants to tie themselves to him and risk prison?'
'Who is more guilty?  The criminal, or the people who protect the criminal?'

'This is a big deal if true, and could lead to the end or severe diminishment of the NRA. If NRA is found to have engaged in conspiracy for illegal money laundering or campaign finance violations that could lead to other ramifications including involuntary corporate dissolution, and refusal by states to allow NRA to fundraise. \n\nSource: Am a lawyer at a nonprofit.'

"China has been dumping it's heavily subsidized solar panels here for years, and it's crushing domestic incentive to be in the market. What do you think happens if China corners that market? Prices rise.\n\nObama imposed tarrifs on Chinese solar. What happened? Same stupid thing China always does, ship to Malaysia/Taiwan/Philippines slap new flags on it and ship it to the US to avoid tariffs. If you start covering *all* solar imports there's no more avoiding it.\n\nThis recommendation was made by a bi-partisan committee. I hate just about everything Trump does but stopping China's new mercantilism isn't one of those things.\n\nEdit: Downvoted? Can't tell if it's Xi cheerleaders or rabid Trump haters.

'30% is actually much less than the 50% proposed by Suniva and SolarWorld. If you haven\'t heard of these two companies, it\'s because they both went **bankrupt** in 2017. They both claim that the reason they had to declare bankruptcy was because solar cells being imported to the US were cheaper and better. And to no surprise, **they are.**\n\nAnd are all these imported panels bad for solar companies? Hell no! US solar companies who actually know how to do business are embracing these higher quality, lower cost products (see also "capitalism"). I am a PV designer for one of the largest residential solar companies in America (no, not *that* one). We offer a handful of different panels, from Norway\'s REC as the workhorse, mid-tier panel to high-efficiency panels from LG, a Korea-based company.\n\nMake no mistake, these tariffs do NOTHING but HURT the US solar industry. And as far as I\'m concerned, the Trump administration, Suniva, and SolarWorld can all three FUCK OFF!!'

For those who haven\'t, it\'s basically the principle that if you move a market for a given good (here, solar cells) out of its "natural clearance price(s)" using taxes, tariffs, price controls you incur a large loss to the economy which is complete deadweight, ie. it goes to no-one, it benefits no-one, it\'s \'value\' completely wasted.                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n\n\nHere\'s why:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                \nImporters of cells have to sell their product at a price above their cost, which limits the price to P1. At price P1 consumers (manufacturers of solar panels, I assume) are able to buy them. This is market equilibrium because buyers and sellers have "negotiated" the minimum price sellers will take and the maximum price buyers will pay.                                                                                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nGood, that\'s a well functioning market, its clean and efficient.

This is because we know there are rich buyers and poor buyers, they all have budgets, so from P1 to P2 there are buyers **forced out of the market!**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n              \n                                                                                                           \n[I have created a chart to help explain this effect.](https://imgur.com/a/sYNlm) The supply curve moves LEFT because sellers can sell LESS at any price above $130, this is because there are now fewer buyers. With me so far?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                         \n                                                                             \n**So why is this bad?** Its bad if you look at the blue triangle in the graph. You\'ll see i\'ve labeled that Deadweight Loss (DWL). DWL goes to nobody in the market, its just wasted because there is no trade happening here. No value created, INCLUDING for the government!!! This is my key point. Tariff=Tax (@30%) but DWL ≠ tax revenue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n                                                    \n                                                                                                                             \n**Easy math to highlight the problem:** *((P2-P1)÷2) x Q2-Q1. To find the area of the blue triangle.                                                           \nIf we input some real figures taken from http://pvinsights.com/ to the formula we see the scale of the issue:                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \nP1=~$0.197 + 30% = P2 (**$0.256-$0.197=$0.059**) So we take P2 and multiply by ΔQ which (as I have no concrete figures) I will call 65,000,000. My assumptions are that each year there is a demand for 1,000,000 solar panels (seems reasonable based on what i\'ve read) and each PANEL supposedly has some 60 to 70 cells, so we\'ll say 65 cells per STANDARD HOME panel.\nOr: *1,000,000x65*= 65,000,000. So lets just say cell demanders are operating on a tight budget, and 8,000,0000 Cells of demand are forced out of the market. (That\'s not too generous but without knowing the elasticity of demand we can\'t be exact, I can crush those numbers if you lot are interested).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n                                                                 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n**Lets tie it all together:** Change in price from tariff = $0.059, Change in quantity demanded from tariff: 8M is a total deadweight loss to the economy of $236,000 worth of **value** which goes to no-one. Not to the government, not to consumers, not to the oil companies and not to the shareholders. \nI should note that a total annual cell demand of 65,000,000 is almost certainly low, the figure is likely in high hundreds of millions, perhaps low billions, but i just don\'t have that data. If we assume 500,000,000 total demand then the deadweight loss is closer to: **$1.8M**. \n\nAgain, it\'s not like this is a benefit passed on to anyone, it\'s just lost. You\'re probably thinking, "meh, what\'s a few million a year to a billion-dollar industry". But remember the cost to society of all those buyers of cells who can no longer afford to take part. That\'s jobs lost, businesses closed.  Hopefully this helps to explain some of the below-surface **economic** costs of seemingly straightforward price controls. \n\n\n\n\n'
'Trade wars are not good for the USA'
"So...He's starting a trade war with China?\n\nThe same people claimed offshoring would help lower prices so consumers could buy more, are now saying that the prices are too low (?), so they artificially inflate prices on foreign products to compete against expensive domestic products? Here's an idea : if it's not profitable here stop making it or find a way to manufacture it profitably - **innovate**.\n\nAs if this will have zero consequences whatsoever....fucking moron. They *will* retaliate and the war is on."

"I went back to school at 25, spent 5 years getting an engineering degree and got my dream job in the solar industry 2 weeks after graduation. I just quit that job because combined with losing our subsidies, I can't make a living selling solar in Oregon. A system that cost $10k last year costs $25k today. People often question why I am so disgusted with Donald Trump, and maybe it's because I can say pretty  directly the man fucked with my life. It sucks pretty bad to give up good years of your life and a shit ton of money to try and help the world, only to feel like you're being punished for it. \n\nedit: can't spell"
'The Moron is killing tens of thousands of jobs with this move. '
'This is obviously contradictory to fucking Adam Smith fucking capitalism. No capitalist would ever consider such a horrible tariff. Trump is not capitalist.  He is destroying the country. '

"It is **extremely likely that McCabe is a witness**.\n\nHe was there for Comey's firing, and was privy to the Russia investigation as it stood at that time. I think the likelihood is high that Mueller will question McCabe. If he hasn't already, that is.\n\nWhy is McCabe stepping down now? Could be any of a number of reasons. It could be that his continued presence in the FBI would be considered a conflict of interest if he is indeed going to act as a witness against the president. It could also be that he's just sick of working under an administration that is explicitly hostile toward him.\n\nSome sources seem to think he was [pressured into resigning](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/andrew-mccabe-forced-to-step-down-as-fbi-deputy-director/).\n\nI suspect we'll find out more details soon enough."
"There was no internal notification of McCabe resigning today, he announced it to a meeting this morning and was out by noon eastern time. Most FBI agents learned he resigned from the news. Which leads me to SPECULATE he was forced out.\n\nIn other news the new deputy director is Dave Bowdich, an FBI agent since 1995 he was head of the counterterrorism unit at the LA field office. He was head of the LA field office from 2014 to 2016 overseeing among other things the 2015 San Bernardino terrorist attack. He was promoted to assistant deputy director in 2016 under President Obama. He was also one of the agents Comey told the details of his conversations with Trump with.\n\nEdit, 4:24 PM EST: the New York Times confirmed my hunch McCabe was forced out. Wray had been pressuring him to resign because of President Trump's criticisms."
"http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/26/trump-launched-campaign-to-discredit-potential-fbi-witnesses/\n\nComey confided in 3 people after Trump asked him to drop the Flynn investigation: \n\n* Andrew McCabe, the current (now former) deputy FBI director and who was briefly acting FBI director after Comey’s firing \n\n* Jim Rybicki, Comey’s chief of staff and senior counselor  \n\n* James Baker, formerly the FBI’s general counsel.\n\nAll three have been removed or left the agency. Although McCabe stepping down was expected before March, there's serious allegations that this campaign of Trump's to intimidate and remove these 3 people constitutes conspiracy to obstruct justice and witness tampering. "
"So now Trump has forced out all 3 of the potential FBI witnesses he targeted.  This is a blatant and sinister political reshaping of the FBI as well as obstruction of justice and probably witness tampering.  \n\nRepublicans allowing this to go on, it's all on them.  This is unprecedented.\n\nReminder from the Foreign Policy article the other day:\n\n> [The FBI officials Trump has targeted are **Andrew McCabe**, the current deputy FBI director and who was briefly acting FBI director after Comey’s firing; **Jim Rybicki**, Comey’s chief of staff and senior counselor; and **James Baker**, formerly the FBI’s general counsel. Those same three officials were first identified as possible corroborating witnesses for Comey in a June 7 article in Vox. **Comey confirmed in congressional testimony the following day that he confided in the three men.**](http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/26/trump-launched-campaign-to-discredit-potential-fbi-witnesses/)\n\nAll 3 are now gone.  Meanwhile, Republicans only focus on fake scandals they themselves fabricate."

'I need to emphasise that terminal leave is NORMAL.  Military and long term civil servants have the option to use up their vacation/PTO bank until their official date of retirement.

"This just came from NBC:\n\n>The day after he fired James Comey as director of the FBI, a furious President Donald Trump called the bureau's acting director, Andrew McCabe, demanding to know why Comey had been allowed to fly on an FBI plane from Los Angeles back to Washington after he was dismissed, according to multiple people familiar with the phone call.\n  &nbsp;\nMcCabe told the president he hadn’t been asked to authorize Comey’s flight, but if anyone had asked, he would have approved it, three people familiar with the call recounted to NBC News.\n  &nbsp;\nThe president was silent for a moment and then turned on McCabe, suggesting he ask his wife how it feels to be a loser — an apparent reference to a failed campaign for state office in Virginia that McCabe’s wife made in 2015.\n  &nbsp;\nMcCabe replied, “OK, sir.” Trump then hung up the phone."
'Damn the trolls are nuts today...'
'My first thought is that he did it so that Mueller can prove that intimidation of a witness led to serious consequence.  McCabe can testify that he indeed had to step down because of pressure from the White House.  More evidence that Trump obstructed justice.'
"Trying to clarify the current Republican logic:\n\nReceiving an email that wasn't marked classified and is then retroactively marked classified on a private server - bad - lock her up.\n\nReleasing classified material to reporters and then to the public - good?\n\nDossier handed over to the FBI by a British spy - bad and shouldn't be investigated any further.\n\nDossier written by a member of the Trump transition team that's being investigated (Nunes) - good and proves guilt of the investigators beyond a reasonable doubt?\n\n"
'Holy hell my brain hurts reading all these comments from bots '
"Conservative here, trying to cut through the bullshit my fellow conservatives are putting forth. Wasn't McCabe already planning on retiring or am I thinking of another FBI official?"
'Not mine:\n\nThese are the misdemeanors (in the non-legal sense) of which Trump is guilty, and which add up to obstruction of justice. I think the facts speak for themselves:\n\n 1. During a dinner at the White House on Jan. 27, 2017, Trump asked for a pledge of “loyalty” from James Comey, then the F.B.I. director, who was overseeing the investigation of the Trump campaign.\n\n 2. On Feb. 14, Trump directed several other officials to leave the Oval Office so he could speak privately with Comey. He then told Comey to “let this go,” referring to the investigation of Michael Flynn, who had resigned the previous day as Trump’s national security adviser.\n\n 3. On March 22, Trump directed several other officials to leave a White House briefing so he could speak privately with Daniel Coats, the director of national intelligence, and Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director. Trump asked them to persuade Comey to back off investigating Flynn.\n\n 4. In March and April, Trump told Comey in phone calls that he wanted Comey to lift the ”cloud” of the investigation.\n\n 5. On May 9, Trump fired Comey as F.B.I. director. On May 10, Trump told Russian officials that the firing had “taken off” the “great pressure” of the Russia investigation. On May 11, he told NBC News that the firing was because of “this Russia thing.”\n\n 6. On May 17, shortly after hearing that the Justice Department had appointed Mueller to take over the Russia investigation, Trump berated Jeff Sessions, the attorney general. The appointment had caused the administration again to lose control over the investigation, and Trump accused Sessions of “disloyalty.”\n\n 7. In June, Trump explored several options to retake control. At one point, he ordered the firing of Mueller, before the White House counsel resisted.\n\n 8. On July 8, aboard Air Force One, Trump helped draft a false public statement for his son, Donald Trump Jr. The statement claimed that a 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer was about adoption policy. Trump Jr. later acknowledged that the meeting was to discuss damaging information the Russian government had about Hillary Clinton.\n\n 9. On July 26, in a tweet, Trump called for the firing of Andrew McCabe, the F.B.I.’s deputy director, a potential corroborating witness for Comey’s conversations with Trump. The tweet was part of Trump’s efforts, discussed with White House aides, to discredit F.B.I. officials.\n\n 10. Throughout, Trump (and this quotation comes from the Nixon article of impeachment) “made false or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the United States.” Among other things, Trump repeatedly made untruthful statements about American intelligence agencies’ conclusions regarding Russia’s role in the 2016 election.\n\nBoom. And we know Mueller has even more. Possibly a lot more.\n\n'
'The GOP has an astounding ability to leverage lies to create "facts on the ground" that the Democrats cannot seem to match with the power of truth. \n\nUntil they figure out how to do that (time is running out), this slow motion attack on democracy will continue until elections will not be able to undo the damage inflicted on our country.\n\nThis type of assault on our country and system of government is very straightforward:\n\n1. Accept the FBI does not need to be corrupt to be "corrupt". You simply state it\'s corrupt until it is "corrupt". Coordinated messaging takes over. People hear the un-truth enough that they believe it. \n\n2. Remove leaders who are loyal to the country, not the party. Replace them with party loyalists. \n\n3. Reap the rewards of a Judicial branch that is de-fanged and unable to provide the checks and balances on the power of the Executive and Legislative branches. \n\n4. Rinse, repeat with any and all agencies and individuals. \n\n5. Own the country.\n\n\n[The NYT had a good discussion  the other day on whether the country has become a "Trumpocracy".](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/opinion/david-frum-trumpcocracy.html)\n\n> Modern authoritarianism is more economical. It will — it has — produced just enough disenfranchisement to get the job done without so much as to rev up so many people as to threaten the whole project.\n\n(...)\n\n>Donald Trump fired an F.B.I. director for blatantly improper, self-serving reasons — and his entire party (and its supporting talkers on TV and radio and the op-ed pages) instantly coalesced on a brand-new theory that the president has an absolute discretionary right to fire the F.B.I. director at any time for any reason, including to protect himself from investigation. Nobody ever believed that before...\n\nTrumpism isn\'t about destroying the state overnight with a single, dramatic gesture. It\'s about chipping-off chunks, piece-by-piece with smaller geopolitical shocks designed to keep the opposition off-balance while complicit Republicans and state TV reset the baseline for what is acceptable using coordinated messaging. \n\nAll authoritarians require government and media to reshape reality. When Trump is out of office, that altered government and reality will be left behind, and we\'re going to have to live with it for a very long time. '
'So, McCabe was living the cop movie where everything goes down right before he\'s set to retire?  Probably walked around the office saying "I\'m too old for this shit" for the last month or so. '

"Good. The president violated the first amendment and abused his power to deprive Kaepeenick of his 1st amendment rights.\n\nTrump also violated the rights of the NFL owners by threatening their livelihoods (he threatened to have tax laws changed to punish them) if they didn't stifle speech.\n\nBut the owners are a bunch of cowards, so I don't expect them to fight. \n\nEDIT: For all you armchair First Amendment Scholars out there, it doesn't begin and end with the words of the law.  There's 200+ years of case law out there, and [government officials threatening to pass or selectively enforce laws to stifle speech is illegal](https://www.cjr.org/covering_trump/trump-nbc.php).\n\nJust for a minute, think about how toothless the First Amendment would be if the government could legally threaten to jail you, but only get in trouble when the actual jailing occurred.\n\nThink about what it would mean to freedom if the President *could threaten* to tax any business that didn't fire employees who owned firearms.\n\nThe president is welcome to espouse his opinion.  But he needs to be *very careful* that he doesn't compel anyone  to stifle speech with threats.  Telling the NFL that he would revisit their tax situation if they did not silence their employees is an explicit threat, an abuse of power.\n\nEdit 2: loving the people who can't read, quote out of context, think this claims the NFL did something illegal, etc. You guys are hilarious.\n\nIt comes down to this... **The government can't trample free speech, and they can't compel others to do it for them.**\n\nIf you think it's OK for the government to threaten your employer so that he does the dirty work for them, you are sadly mistaken."
'Due to the language of the law, it\'ll be hard to show evidence that Trump "forced or ordered" the firing because of political affiliation.  The best Colin can do is to scare the owners and Trump with a lawsuit that requires discovery of communications between the NFL and Trump\'s people. Nothing these people hate more than seeing their communications shown to the public.  No doubt there will be of people saying some not so choice words about black people.'

'>\n"It wasn’t until I became a politician, that I realised how nasty, how mean, how vicious and how fake the press can be," Mr Trump said. Pointing into the crowd, he added: "… as the cameras start going off in the back."\n\nIt\'s that last part that\'s shocking. He constantly acts like the underdog, like the world is trying to silence him, and heaps of people are falling for it. '
'[He is recycling talking points that are almost 30 years old.](https://youtu.be/K4qi5sP48OE)\n\n>"I guess I’ve always felt that the press was inherently honest. And now I cross the line to say that generally speaking the press is inherently dishonest."\n\n-Donald Trump, 1990\n\n>"And as a businessman I was always treated really well by the press. You know the numbers speak and things happen but I’ve always really had a very good press. And it wasn’t until I became a politician that I realized how nasty, how mean, how vicious, and how fake the press can be."\n\n-Donald Trump, 2018 '
'"As the cameras start going off in the back"\n\nWhile the cameras are still on\n\nWhy the fuck does he always pretend that they stop recording when he starts talking about them? It literally never happens. Ever. Not once. '
"What a crock of horseshit top to bottom.\n\nTrump struggled with the press from the late-80s onward because he didn't like their coverage of his salacious affairs and of his illegal real estate dealings. As is well known, he frequently and under assumed identities contacted various press outlets to get them to stop covering him negatively. \n\nIf he's capable of remembering that far back in time–way back before he became a reality TV fixture whose schtick was essentially embracing the persona of an aloof, contemptible and tacky asshole–then it must still stick in his craw that even as POTUS he can't make the press lie on his behalf. \n\nAmerica's most needy, whiney and obnoxious clown has not changed a whit in over thirty years of public spotlight. "
'Another day, another crazy bout of projection.  Nasty, mean and fake are your make-up, Don.  Stop unloading your personal faults on the world'
" I can't listen to any more of his loathsome, lying self-aggrandisement. I wouldn't give a moron like this a job cleaning the toilets in my firm, never mind anything more substantial. Yet half of Americans decided to vote for him to be THE FUCKING POTUS??!!\n\nI have NEVER heard him say a single sentence which wasn't either a lie, incoherent, or bragging.  What a category A piece of shit. "
'They also clapped a lot and I saw a lot of heads stand up when he was finished.  Maybe the nasty mean fake press could have made the headline "Trump gives succesful talk at World Economic Forum" - but that wouldn\'t make the nasty mean or fake now would it.'
"You can buy all the tacky gold crap you want. You can slap your name on every building and product under the sun. You can wear your tie right down to your ankles. You'll never have class, you'll never have respect, and you'll never be one of the big boys. The elites will always look down on you. They'll never love you. Just like your father."
'It\'s just mind numbing that this ass wipe is a sitting U.S. president. He is not "making America great again", nor will he. He will most certainly drive the clown car off of a cliff. The world is asking WTF America.'
'Couldn\'t the title of this just as easily have been "Trump insults the press to laughs and applause?" I mean that happened in addition to the boos in roughly equally proportion. Trump is the fucking worst, but this is not a good title.\n\nIt isn\'t fake news though, just biased or slanted.'
"While he feverishly tweeted about Obama all those years, Trump's forgetting that he himself is a conjurer of that which he hates.  He created what he feared:  **Fake News**"
"The press was never nice to him. They always treated him like the clown he is.  Trump was publicly mocked at the gathering of a *whole organization of journalists* aka the White House Correspondent's dinner for fucks sake which led to him running, and was when he really turned on the press.  Just more delusions.  "
"I've been an avid student of politics for all my life, back to the mid 1970s. I've disagreed with many presidents, including those aligned more closely with my personal ideology, but I've never been embarrassed by the simple fact that they were the president. Even W, as much as I loathed him, because his respect for the office was always evident. \n\nNot Trump. What an asshole. What an idiot. There's literally nothing positive to say about his presidency nor his administration. But, for myself, the worst is how daily he degrades the dignity of the office. \n\nI really hate hyperbole, but I'm still justified, I believe, in calling him the worst president ever."
'As he\'s slamming the press, he again makes the ridiculous claim,  "... as the cameras start going off in the back." He repeats this absurd lie over and over. WTF is wrong with that fool?'
'Considering the news last night where Trump lied repeatedly about his intention to fire Mueller, making comments about "fake news" seems ill timed. '
"Trump claimed the stock market would have crashed if a Dem got elected, despite strong, sustained gains under Obama for 8 years.\n\nI'm so fed up with all the lies.  I've never seen someone lie so much as Trump."

">Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, received a secret payment of at least $400,000 to fix talks between the Ukrainian president and President Trump, according to sources in Kiev close to those involved.\n\n>The payment was arranged by intermediaries acting for Ukraine's leader, Petro Poroshenko, the sources said, though Cohen was not registered as a representative of Ukraine as required by US law.\nThe meeting at the White House was last June.\n\n>Shortly after the Ukrainian president returned home, his country's anti-corruption agency stopped its investigation into Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort.\n\nBOOM! BASTA! Good read!\n\nEdit: thank you olddivorcecase\n\n\n[BREAKING: Mueller team asks court to start George Papadopoulos sentence process. That means they have everything they need regarding his cooperation. This is an absolute disaster for Trump and his associates. It will only get worse for them. Much, much, much worse.](https://twitter.com/funder/status/999348219871137792)\n\n[Here is a cnn source confirming the story](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/05/23/mueller-trump-papadopoulos-sourt-sentencing-process-prokupecz-wolf.cnn) There are a bunch of other sources if you look.  \nEvery outlet is carrying it now. The story is confirmed. "
" I can't keep up anymore. Is this new treason or previously reported treason? "
'> "Poroshenko\'s inner circle were shocked by how dirty this whole arrangement [with Cohen] was."\n> \n\nThe Ukrainians were shocked at how dirty it was. The mother fucking Ukrainians were shocked. It\'s not like they are unfamiliar with corruption. '
'>Ukraine\'s domestic intelligence service, the SBU, did their own - secret - report on Mr Manafort.\n>It found that there was not one "black ledger" but three and that Mr Manafort had been paid millions of dollars more from Ukraine than had been made public. (Mr Manafort has denied any wrongdoing.)\n\n> **This information was given to me by a very senior police officer who saw the report. He said it had not been passed to the Americans.**\n\nHoly shit. \n\n'
'A news organisation more reputable than every news organisation in America, and people still call it fake news. Guess people will never be happy when the news is negative.'
'>There is no suggestion that Trump knew about the payment\n\nThis is terrible phrasing. Trump has not commented. That’s it. Because Trump’s modus aperendi is that he gets a kick back each time his name his used. Add to the fact that Cohen is broke as fuck, and we have a strong case the president is taking bribes for access. And if this payment came out of essential consulting, there is no doubt Trump effectively profiting off this.'
'Nothing unusual here folks. Move right along. Not a thing to see here. Besides, Q told me that Hillary is going to be locked up any day now, shit is hitting the fan 14 months ago, 1.5 months ago, and two days ago. And some random anonymous internet stranger that spews ridiculous facts that would only be believable by the gullible, willfully ignorant, or mentally incompetent would never be wrong, right?'
'And the hits keep on coming...\n\nWon"t the GOP, that bastion of righteousness and fiscal accountability, who went after OBAMA for eating DIJON mustard on a hamberger, go after TRUMP and COHEN for using the PRESIDENCY as their personal GOLDEN GOOSE?\n\nFor Fuck Sakes People...i mean Republicans.\n\nthats a direct violation of the EMULUMENTS\'S Clause, a violation of the ESPIONAGE ACT, a violation of the Presidential OATH of OFFICE.\n\nThats it...\n\nI don\'t believe in their self righteousness any more.\n\nThey are a worthless, monstrous, degenerate people.\n\nYou deserve no mercy if you all go to jail.'

"Bad President enabled by bad Republican politicians enabled by Republicans. Fuck every Republican. \n\nBoycott their businesses, kick them out of the sewing club, don't go bowling with them or invite them to barbecues. Egg their houses, key their cars. Maybe some are family, don't call them until they change their tune.\n\nCome to think of it, if I remember correctly, political affiliation is not a protected class. I would not bake a Republican a wedding cake - just saying."
"So the missing piece here is why Trump would give a fuck what Cohen wants from him.  The obvious answer is money.\n\nIf someone can just prove a dollar of that $400k made it into a Trump/Trump Org account, this seems like cut and dry bribery, one of the two crimes specifically listed in the Constitution as grounds for impeachment (the other being treason).\n\nMaybe we are starting to see why a judge would sign a warrant to raid Cohen's office/home/hotel room and why Trump is so upset about it.  Of course, attorney-client privilege would not protect communication about a conspiracy to commit crimes but I can believe that Cohen and Trump both thought it would."
'This time last year the FBI raided a firm who did fundraising for the RNC that was connected to Cambridge Analytica. That was when I first stated hearing whispers of RICO in connection with the RNC.\n\nEverything about the Mueller investigation continues to point to not only the Trump campaign conspiring against the American people to undermine our democracy, but that the RNC was also complicit.\n\nAnd anyone who knows their history, knows how the FBI has busted dirty unions. Cohen is the deputy finance chair ffs.'
'Holy fucking hell. The BBC is *not* fucking around with this story.'
"This would be a major scandal in LITERALLY every other country in the world (other than DPRK). Why the fuck aren't things being done!?"
'If someone were to post the exact same article with Trump’s name replaced with Hilary and nothing else different, I bet republicans would lose their shit. '
'This should result in a number of felony indictments bribery, conspiracy against US, money laundering, lying to the FBI, obstruction of justice, impeding in a federal investigation, and a few others.\n\nCohen has previously admitted to receiving dirt on Ukraine’s President from a political opponent and has also admitted to passing this information to Flynn with the intent of influencing Trump policies.\n\nhttps://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/us/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-russia.html'
"Wait. Money is going from Ukraine to US. Not the other way around. Trump's team didn't pay to make Poroshenko kill the investigation of manafort, he probably did it because Trump asked him to(like he asked Comey to end the Flynn investigation) and he complied to curry favor. I'm wondering what Poroshenko got in return. Maybe weapons even though that was 5-6 months later? I doubt it was that. Something is missing. "

'A mayor who fed into the local corruption, who also did nothing to improve what the PR government would do for its people, gets a chance at this. Wow. The PR government was failing its own people for YEARS with local corruption, but once this disaster struck, she saw it as an opportunity for redemption and political pivot.\n\nShe did nothing for the people with a poor economy, terrible infrastructure, etc aside from “stand up to Trump”. I know people over there that hate her for cashing out the fame, but having done nothing up until that point for PR.\n'
'Person of the year for bankrupting her city and letting people starve to death because of lack of preparations for a hurricane.\n\nThe left is insane. '
"So the Mayor who is regularly condemned by her constituents and colleagues for grandstanding and spending more time in front of a television camera than actually helping people is up for person of the year and people casually dismiss fake news? Perhaps if she did her job in the first place and provided some oversight or managed the infrastructure better a typical hurricane wouldn't have become an island crisis. That goes for the majority of PR bureaucrats derelict in their responsibilities.\n\nI think it's time we had a serious conversation about Puerto Rican independence."
'Why is anyone supporting her? She\'s just as inept and fucked as Trump. She refused to do the right thing multiple times because of politics and her underlings did the same as well. The Puerto Rican government fucked over Puerto Rico more than Trump ever did.

'Putins goal in meddling in our elections, as stated by many in the IC, was to cause chaos and instability. He achieved a win by putting Trump in office, but theres no loyalty there.

'I wonder if Hannity gets jealous when Putin interrupts their time on the phone together.'
"Regardless of the validity of this claim, Putin is saying this to sow disorder. I'm not saying this to defend Trump, I'm saying to say that we should ignore Putin."

"Putin is quite possibly just trolling the hell out of American media.  It doesn't matter whether or not this is true, it'll get reported as true despite people not trusting Putin.  It's confirmation bias and meant to create even more discord between American citizens.  "

My sense is there is a deal being worked out to save face for both Mueller and Trump. Let\'s end this fake inquiry and turn towards the real enemy: Hildabeast“\n\n-\n>”The entire point of everything Mueller has done is to weave together a narrative so that no matter what Trump says one way or another he has someone on record contradicting him, and it will be someone close to him and he will be forced to attack said person and undermine credibility. Oh yea, I\'m totally loving all this law and order. Martial law please, order us out into the streets to hang these communists and we will do it in a heartbeat.“\n\n-\n>”Mueller is expert at entrapping people and turning the slightest fumbling of words into crimes. #$%$ of the Earth.

'“All the grownups around me keep warning me not to stick my fork into the electrical outlet. But what the hell do they know!”'
'In the comments of the “Dowd Quits Donnie” article, it was hypothesized that Trump wasn’t listening to Dowd and was about to do something so monumentally stupid that Dowd had to resign or go down with the ship. The ideas were either “Trump fires Mueller” or “Trump meets with Mueller.” The question was which was it.\n\nThis answers that question.'
"How did this moron survive to a ripe old age without going to prison already? He's like the dumb violent kid in middle school who isn't afraid of the cops. Do it, Donnie. DO IT."
'And that explains why Dowd decided to quit today.\n\nThis interview is happening folks, no two ways about it. I expect Mueller to drop charges on Trump before the end of the summer.\n\nEDIT: Also, how many GOPers in the Senate & House right now are shitting their pants? All of them?'
"This feeble line is for his supporter's consumption.  The last thing Trump is *ever* going to do is submit to questioning where he will be under oath and cannot lie and deflect.  Ultimately, he will fight to the very end to avoid sitting in front of Mueller's team of crack lawyers."
'I hope this doesnt turn into "I was planning on cooperating, but this darn new AG fired him before I could!"'
"This has to be why Dowd wanted out. He knows that no amount of legal strategy can defend Donny if he testifies. Dowd is no dummy he's fully aware of how dumb and how prone to lying Trump is. Lawyers live or die by the amount of big cases that they win and he's not taking a guaranteed L."
"**My biggest fear:** \nTrump comes out of this interview complete unscathed legally, because he goes in an makes a bunch of claims, Mueller has evidence disproving his entire testimony from multiple sources, and it becomes clear he actually had 0 idea what was going on with his campaign, he is all talk, and his obsession with Russia and Putin is one of pure jealously, not out of being compromised.\n\nLong story short: He's completely incompetent, and has no idea he's surrounded by traitors, and gets to stay in the White House because he literally had no idea what put him there."
"Trump has been able to talk and bully his way out of trouble and get what he wants his whole life so he thinks can do so here too. He's never tried to talk his way out of something this big before. The last time I know the federal gov't. was after him I remember they got him for housing discrimination. "
'Coming at this from a different, psychological angle: could this be l\'appel du vide (the call of the void)? Perhaps Trump is so exhausted by everything in his Presidency that he just wants it to end. He wants to go to the edge of the cliff and jump off. I\'m not sure if it\'s a conscious thing or a subconscious thing, but either way. To go Freudian on it: Maybe his ego is telling him to do it based on the dumb assumption that he could beat the Mueller team, which is fueled by his id which wants him to get out of this stressful situation. \n\nThe guy is old and in way over his head. But he also has an ego, and he might not see resignation as an option because that\'s "giving up." So perhaps he wants to get impeached, so he can continue to go kicking and screaming about conspiracies, witch hunts, and fake news. He (along with his followers) will blame it on some deep state bullshit. He gets to preserve his ego by going down saying it was all a lie, while getting out of the stress of being President. Seems like a win-win, if he can manage to avoid prison. Maybe he thinks he can be pardoned like Nixon.'
"So, some people are saying his lawyer left because Trump was going to fire Mueller. It's really possible he left because Trump was going to testify, which would be an equally bad idea. "
'I think it’s just sickening that we live in a time when Trump can attack our greatest politicians in modern history with childless quips referring to beating them up like some grade school bully, threatening leaders of other countries over Twitter, while endlessly kowtowing to his Russian overlord, calls Putin to congratulate him on a rigged election while ignoring bipartisan imposed sanctions on him for meddling in our democratic process and killing citizens of other countries in broad daylight while the main media focus is on his adulterous relationship with pornstars, the media eats it up and it’s disgusting. Don’t let any of these cheap veils the media is conveniently placing over your eyes distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer’s table.'
'You have it all wrong, it’s missing a comma;\n\nTrump says he wants to testify to Mueller, in Russia.'

'It was over the day he fired Comey and contradicted his official reason on national television. '
'> "This left Trump enraged and he has perseverated on it ever since"\n\nTIL the word: perseverate.\n\n"...the repetition of a particular response (such as a word, phrase, or gesture) regardless of the absence or cessation of a stimulus. It is usually caused by a brain injury or other organic disorder."\n\n(From the Wikipedia definition)\n\n'
'I don\'t recall a debate. I recall most people saying "well, obviously..." and a large group of deluded mental weaklings screeching about their feelings and how terrified they are of Hillary Clinton. \n\nThat\'s not a debate. There has been no debate. There is no need for a debate. '
'Unfortunately we have to wait until Mueller\'s done.  It\'s possible he exonerates Trump though.  \n\n"President did not commit this crime, he\'s just stupid.  Ask Rex Tillerson, he\'ll tell you."\n\nThe writer of this article makes an assumption (as realistic as it sounds) that Trump wanted session in the position to get him to quash the investigation, which would be obstruction.  But this hope of his isn\'t enough on its face to count as obstruction, some might say.  So you take in a lot of the other evidence of Trump trying to fire Mueller, asking Comey to close the investigation into Flynn, etc... and it looks more compelling I know.  But the law is tricky.  People get away with all kinds of shit all the time.  \n\nIf he does exonerate Trump in that area... the precedent will doom us.  Public officials everywhere will just have to take all these notes on how to do it.  How to interfere with probes and get away with it.  Like... just strong arm and threaten people without using certain words and act like an idiot otherwise and they\'ll never get you.  It\'s fucked. \n\nThen there\'s the problem if he basically indicts POTUS with a report to Rosenstein/congress.  It\'s possible that congress does nothing.  It\'s possible they\'ve swayed public opinion enough to not face any consequences should they choose not to impeach.  \n\nI guess we\'ll see.\n\nEven then, the numerous probes into Trump and his family/associates/business will continue and probably find many more issues... Then possibly just repeat the process above.  In end, again, will anything happen?\n\nFuck, I hate the GOP.'
"Trump epitomizes the worst aspects of America. \n\nIgnorant, ill-educated, arrogant, rude, crass, narcissistic, vain, tasteless, and greedy. \n\n\nI will never get over this. I would never buy a used car from Trump, and you should see some of used car salesmen I've bought cars from before. And this dishonest clown is running the country. Nearly half the country still supports him!?! \n\nIt just floors me. I understand people not liking Hillary. I don't really agree that she would have been a bad President, but I see where people dislike the secrecy, all the scandal, etc. What I don't get is liking Trump. \n\nThe fact that Trump polls over 10% should be a wakeup call that something is NOT right in the US.  You really can't get a much clearer signal that a good deal of people are complete and utter fools, or so cynical and removed from political power they just want the country to burn. \n\nIf we make it through Trump, there is still a major problem that has to be dealt with--what is wrong with people/the country? How the hell do you fix it? "
'So... are all the Republicans who are refusing to do anything about it also guilty of obstructing justice?'
'All the people who gave a shit knew this when he fired James Comey in the middle of a fucking investigation of his own damn campaign. The fact that congress didnt do anything then is what allowed it to get to this point. The only people denying it are idiots and accomplices... next story'
"The debate never really existed. There was suspicion, it was pursued, and now there's evidence, and that's been the case for the better part of a year. The rest of it is GOP politics trying to divert attention from their god\\-awful platform and further stoke the political dumpster fire war that they've been brewing for the past three decades."
"No shit. There's been enough public evidence to indict Trump on obstruction since last summer. Mueller likely has even more. "
"The debate is hardly over.  \n\n\nThis line of argumentation has been tried over and over again. Normal Presidential authorities are being challenged because Trump used them. This was tried with the Travel Ban. The argument was that even though the law allows the President to bar from entry any class of aliens he wants, critics argued it was illegal because Trump hates Muslims. Take a listen to the Supreme Court arguments. Seriously does not look like there are 5 Justices willing to apply that test to a President's Constitutional powers.\n\nLikewise, the President has the authority to make hiring and firing decisions in high\\-ranking government positions, especially in his cabinet. He has every right to ask his Attorney General to manage the DOJ in a certain way. Contrary to what people like to think, the DOJ is not autonomous. The FBI Director and AG both serve at the pleasure of the President.   \n\n\nThis argument that Trump can obstruct justice this way is to say that the President would lose certain Constitutional authorities simply because people he knows personally are under criminal investigation. The President has every right to direct the Attorney General. The Attorney General also has every right to say 'no,' though in normal circumstances it would result in him being fired.\n\nDuring the Obama years, Congress was investigating Eric Holder's handling of the Fast and Furious gun walking operation. Congress subpoenaed records, including Holder's emails. Barack Obama shielded those documents from Congressional investigators using executive privilege, including emails between Eric Holder and his mother.  \n\n\nEric Holder defied Congress and refused to hand over the documents that Obama shielded. He was held in Contempt of Congress and referred for prosecution. The criminal referral landed on his desk. Eric Holder didn't recuse himself. As Attorney General, he chose not to allow a criminal referral against himself to move forward.\n\nThat, in my mind, is far more criminal than instructing a cabinet member to run a Department in a particular way. But alas, the Obama administration had zero scandals..."
'No shit Sherlock. The bigger question is...will **GOP** impeach. And will **Trump** be convicted of bribery, conspiracy, **treason**, and **RICO**? But that’s just Trump...\n\n**Mueller** is after **‘the swamp’**. So, the investigation will keep dozing forward until every criminal (in this deeply criminal **GOP**/Foreign establishment) is spooked from the woods into handcuffs. Lock them up!'
'That was never the debate.  The debate is "what is anyone going to do about it."  I put money on "more nothing."  The Dems only want to do to Trump what the GOP did to Obama: delegitimize him.  That\'s why they\'re focusing on nothing but the election collusion and the Stormy Daniels suit.  He breaks another law every day, but they don\'t want to focus on fraud, bribery, nepotism, or anything that they may want to do themselves later.'

'Because of *course* they do.\n\n"Look over there, folks! Far away from the mess in the white house!"\n\nCall me when charges are actually filed. Until then, this is classified bullshit intended to distract from the larger investigation. Where are those Fusion GPS transcripts? '
"They're literally ignoring the task they set for themselves over fucking partisan bullshit! Lest we forget, Grassley is the one refusing the release the transcript of the closed hearing testimony of Glenn R. Simpson after Simpson told him to go ahead and release it. \n\nEdit: Added these quotes. \n\n>Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a senior committee member, told the Justice Department they had reason to believe that a former British spy, Christopher Steele, lied to federal authorities about his contacts with reporters regarding information in the dossier, and they urged the department to investigate. The committee is running one of three congressional investigations into Russian election meddling, and its inquiry has come to focus, in part, on Mr. Steele’s explosive dossier that purported to detail Russia’s interference and the Trump campaign’s complicity.\n\n>The decision by Mr. Grassley and Mr. Graham to single out the former intelligence officer behind the dossier — and not anyone who may have taken part in the Russian interference — was certain to infuriate Democrats and raise the stakes in the\xa0growing partisan battle over the investigations\xa0into Mr. Trump, his campaign team and Russia.\n\n>More than a year ago,\xa0Republican leaders in Congress agreed that committees in the House and Senate would investigate Russia’s efforts to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. **Mr. Graham declared in December 2016, “The first thing we want to establish is, ‘Did the Russians hack into our political system?’ Then you work outward from there.”**\n\n.  .  .\n\n>But the dossier has emerged as Exhibit A in Republicans’ insistence that Obama-era political bias could have affected the F.B.I.’s decision to open a counterintelligence investigation in July 2016 into whether Mr. Trump’s associates aided the Russia election interference.\n\n>Republicans, including the two senators, have argued that the dossier is tantamount to political opposition research, and claimed that it might have been used by the F.B.I. to open its investigation. They have also said it might have provided the basis for key investigative actions, including\xa0a secret court-approved wiretap of a Trump campaign aide.\n\nAnd opposition research is a completely normal thing to do. Literally everybody does it in campaigns. If, during opposition research, a crime is discovered, **it doesn't stop being a fucking crime**. Not to mention, investigators have maintained the investigation started before the dossier was released.\n\n>Current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the investigation say that the federal inquiry did not start with the dossier, nor did it rely on it. Rather, they have said, the dossier and the F.B.I.’s discussions with Mr. Steele merely added material to what American law enforcement and spy agencies were gleaning from other sources.\n\nThis is literally the dumbest fucking partisan move. It's Benghazi hearings levels of dumb.\n\n>Mr. Grassley’s decision to recommend criminal charges appeared likely to be based on reports of Mr. Steele’s meetings with the F.B.I., which were provided to the committee by the Justice Department in recent weeks.\n\n>**It was not clear why, if a crime is apparent in the F.B.I. reports that were reviewed by the Judiciary Committee, the Justice Department had not moved to charge Mr. Steele already.**\n\n>The circumstances under which Mr. Steele is alleged to have lied were unclear, as much of the referral was classified.\n\n.  .  .\n\n>“Publicizing a criminal referral based on classified information raises serious questions about whether this letter is nothing more than another attempt to discredit government sources, in the midst of an ongoing criminal investigation,” said Joshua A. Levy, the lawyer for Fusion. “We should all be skeptical in the extreme.” "
'Yeah.  I\'ve been saying for a year now that the GOP are essentially turning this whole shitshow into a coup.  A lot of conservatives I know that are anti-Trump, or at least not Trump lovers, have kept insisting that the "sensible" Republicans will hold Trump to the rule of law.\n\nThere are no sensible Republicans in federal office.  They are killing the country and looting its corpse, and then looking to build us a prison from its bones.\n\nWe are literally on the precipice of living in a full ethno-fascist state with "biblical" law.  It doesn\'t matter that the psychotics behind this are in a national minority when they control the political power, the money, and *possibly* enough military power to wipe out their opposition.\n\nMy buddy that has over a decade of special operations experience told me to say bye-bye to the DoD chain of command if it comes down to this, and that organizations such as JSOC is where we\'d better rest the hopes that we have, if any.\n\nWe need to not let things get to that point.  This needs to be fought all the way to November, and we *have* to flip the house.  If we can\'t...  What we\'ve seen so far will be *nothing*.  With no midterms to worry about, the Republicans will go *totally fucking crazy*.'
'I really have to hand it to these snakes.\n\nThey prepared a classified document, but made it unclassified if you took away all the evidence and context.\n\nThis could be a pathetic and baseless "criminal referral", but we don\'t get to know that because the information is classified. However, we DEFINITELY get to know that a criminal referral has been made.'
"I'm actually starting to find my country revolting. Like legitimately disgusting. The utter hypocrisy of the GOP, the ignorance of their voters, the apathy of the public at large, the incompetence of Democrats, the control private industries have over the political process and the lack of repercussions for telling complete lies. I've served in the military. I've always loved my country but I'm beginning to think the problems are so rooted in our culture that the rot is marrow deep. Once Trump is inevitably gone nothing will change. This isn't a political problem anymore. It's a cultural one."

"The DOJ is going after Trump's political opponent for political reasons, Congress is going after the guy who fucking exposed this Russia shit in the first place.. instead of.. you know.. the people who actually conspired with them.\n\nThese people are fucking traitors."
'The fact that these Republicans are willing to destroy their own party for Donald Trump says all you need to know about the character of these shitiots. The moment they got word the Mueller investigation was unearthing financial crimes they went into full panic mode. Treasonous pieces of trash that all deserve to rot in prison'
"We should all be in the streets. If only we didn't have student loans, ridiculous housing costs, long commute times, and weren't living off wages that haven't adjusted to the inflation of living costs.\n\n\nIt's tough. I know every single day that everything I'm doing is merely treating a symptom instead of eradicating the disease.  I'm struggling to gain some sense of financial independence from corporations who want to squeeze me for all of the EBIDTA that I'm worth, but in the back of mind I'm depressed.  I know that doing so requires putting contributing to more important causes on the back burner.\n\nOur country is not in good shape."

If so, these fucks are intentionally excluding that information with the intent of making this look like a partisan witch hunt while completely ignoring the fact they kicked off this fucking thing themselves."

'The GOP is attacking the First Amendment.  Fascist assholes.'
'Holy shit this is bad. This is really fucking bad. This right here is how one would overthrow the government and install a dictator--using the government to prosecute those who testify against the president. '
"This just compounds the GOP. They're shortsighted.\n\nSteele has helped the US on several fronts and if they do attempt to charge him you are going to see other operatives unwilling to work with the US without more coming their way or they outright will refuse. The GOP is so hellbent on preserving Trump's base, not Trump, that they will murder any innocent bystander just to get eyes to look away from the naked old saggy dementia patient rubbing his dick on the Constitution."
"What's scary is that these people are still doubling down KNOWING details from the investigation are coming.  They literally are selling our country to fascist in broad daylight.  A fights is coming, and they know it.  This is them announcing their side."
"I'd forgotten Nunes sent goons to ambush Steele. \n\n> And he [Representative Devin Nunes of California] has aggressively pursued Fusion GPS, subpoenaing the company’s bank records and sending two committee staff members to London last summer to try to meet with Mr. Steele unannounced.\n\nNunes is completely out of control, drunk with power. In what fucking world does a US congressman assail a British citizen with thuggish mobster enforcer tactics. And we saw Trump do this when he sent his thug Keith Schiller to hand deliver Comey's termination. If not for Joseph McCarthy and Roy Cohn we could call this unprecedented. \n\nOur fucking tax dollars paid for those Nunes goons on that fools errand. These ~~fucking~~ motherfucking Republicans are going to destroy this country. "
"If there was ever any doubt at all that a lot of Republican politicians are most likely implicated in all of this, it's gone now. This confirms it. This shit is crazy."

'As a consequence of being human, teachers and other school employees also have the potential to act violently. According to a report on “Campus Attacks – Targeted Violence Affecting Institutions of Higher Learning” ([PDF - link to pg 23](https://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/campus-attacks.pdf#page=23)) released in [2010](https://www2.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2010/04/04142010.html) that was produced by a collaborative effort involving the FBI, the US Secret Service, and the Department of Education (note: the cases of violent attacks in the report include but aren\'t limited to shootings):\n>Of those cases in which this information was reported (n = 268), a majority of the subjects were identified as either current or former students at the affected IHE (60 percent, n = 161), while approximately one-tenth were current or former employees of the IHE (11 percent, n = 29). An additional 20 percent (n = 53) of the subjects were indirectly affiliated with the IHE through a personal relationship with a current IHE student and/or employee. In less than one-tenth of the cases (9 percent, n = 25), the subject had no known affiliation with the affected IHE.\n\nThe employees who carried out violent attacks at institutions of higher education (IHE) “Included range of positions, such as professors, librarians, security, janitorial, other” and they were responsible for 27 of the 279 deaths and 10 of the 245 injuries in the cases that were analyzed in Table 6 on page 23.\n\nAlso, in reference to IHE attacks in general (carried out by students, employees, and others): \n>What method of attack was used? \n\n>Firearms were used most often (54 percent, n = 148), followed by knives/bladed weapons (21 percent, n = 57), a combination of weapons/methods (10 percent, n = 26), and strangulation either manually or with an implement (5 percent, n = 14). Of those incidents in which a combination of methods was used, most targets were strangled and stabbed. The remaining 27 incidents (10 percent) involved a blunt object, firebomb/incendiary/arson, explosives, poison, a vehicle, or a physical assault without a weapon. \n\n>Whom did the subjects harm? \n\n>Across all 272 incidents, the subjects caused 281 deaths and injured 247 individuals. Of the deaths, at least 190 were students and at least 72 were employees. Of the injured, at least 144 were students and at least 35 were employees. Not included in these numbers are the subjects themselves who were injured or killed either during or following the incident. In 26 percent (n = 71) of the incidents, the subject died of a self-inflicted injury incurred during implementation of the assault or within hours or days of the incident. In 4 percent of the incidents (n = 11), the subject survived his self-inflicted injuries and in an additional 4 percent of the incidents (n = 10), the subject was killed by law enforcement during or immediately following the assault.\n\nRemember that the following happened at the University of Alabama, Huntsville (UAH) in 2010 ([Nature:](https://www.nature.com/news/2010/100512/full/465150a.html) “Universities: Life after death”):\n>On a Friday afternoon in early February, Amy Bishop, an assistant professor in the department, pulled out a black 9-millimetre pistol during a biology faculty meeting. "She just went down the line", wearing a look that was "cold, very cold", says Ng. At point-blank range, Bishop shot five of her colleagues in the head, killing three of them and critically wounding two others…\n\n>On 12 February at 3 p.m., members of the biology faculty gathered for a meeting in Room 369R — a small, windowless conference room tucked away in a corner of the Shelby Center for Science and Technology, where the biology department occupies the whole of the third floor. Budgeting issues were on the agenda and attendance was good: 12 of the 14 faculty members squeezed around the table. Stephanie Monticciolo, the department\'s staff assistant, joined them to take notes. Bishop arrived shortly before the meeting started and positioned herself at the corner of the table nearest the door. Roughly 50 minutes into the meeting, she produced what Ng remembers as "a big, black pistol".\n\n>Aiming for the head in each case, Bishop fired systematically, getting off at least five rounds in what survivors say was probably 20 to 30 seconds. Starting on her immediate right, Bishop aimed at the face of Gopi Podila, killing the department\'s affable chairman, who was a nationally recognized plant biochemist. She then shot Monticciolo in the left temple, gravely injuring her.\n\n>Bishop turned to her left and killed Adriel Johnson, a gastrointestinal physiology expert, who had made a career of encouraging minority students into science. The next lethal shot hit plant scientist Maria Ragland Davis, who had come to the university from Research Genetics, a local biotechnology firm.\n\n>A ricocheting bullet or bone fragment hit Luis Cruz Vera, a molecular biologist and the department\'s newest faculty member, who sustained a minor chest wound. Bishop then fired at Joseph Leahy, sending a bullet slicing through his skull and critically wounding him. She pointed the gun next at Moriarity and pulled the trigger, but the gun jammed and wouldn\'t fire.\n\n>After Bishop stepped into the hall, the survivors locked and barricaded the door with a coffee table and called the police. Bishop was arrested a few minutes later outside the building and has been charged with capital murder and attempted murder.\n'
"He's just muddying the waters to avoid taking any action.  So is anybody who for a second thinks that arming teachers is any kind of solution.\n\nThis is a negotiating tactic for pacifying the outraged.  Distract, confuse, propose absurd solutions to their outrage.  It moves the emotion from the incident to the discussion, which is major leverage for impotent leaders.  \n\nThis is also where the 'crisis actors' conspiracy theories are coming from.  It's so utterly stupid that people get distracted by the insanity of it, and stop thinking about what these students are saying.  It's also effective at discrediting their message if you're susceptible to conspiracy theories.\n\nThis is what information warfare looks like.  "
"student walks into school - starts firing - panic ensues, classrooms are locked shut, students running for cover, running out of the building - police arrive - unknown is the shooter's identity, or even how many shooters there are - teacher X has a gun in his desk, is huddled with his students - gets gun from desk, hears what he thinks is the shooter outside the classroom - see where this is going?  Adding more guns to the situation, not in the hands of trained people, is only going to make things worse.\n\nWhat is wrong with putting an armed police officer in every school?  A few less cops sitting in their 'hiding' spots trying to catch people speeding and instead making their presence known and visible in every single school building makes a lot more sense to me."
'Trump is getting more and more unstable.  I think the indictment of 13 Russians last week shows Mueller is getting closer and Trump is panicking. His tweet storms are even more scattergun than the past. He hates being exposed to people who don\'t kisses his ass. He never has press conferences, only likes to watch Fox, tweets when he\'s upset. In some ways I am beginning to realize Trump is the both Democrats worst nightmare and greatest dream. Trump is dismantling and attacking much of the Democrat agenda. But Trump is also destroying the Republican brand. Ther right fed their base dog whistles of racism, sexism, hatred, and anger whiled simultaneously dismantling the New Deal Democrat union welfare state by defection. Trump has pulled the facade off the middle class Christian veneer the GOP tried to keep as they\'re public face for independent voters. Now the GOP is what it always was, screaming racial epitaphs in public that I see on YouTube and here on reddit.  Invariably the idiot screaming says something to the effect "I can call you n*****r because Trumps my president". The GOP is the Trump party. I have personally seen many co workers and friends who were upper middle class Republicans and used to be proud of the label Republican now ashamed because it is now synonymous with bigot. The tax scam was they\'re last straw, losing the state and local exemption is going to cost them thousands. They will vote a Democrat this fall or stay home. The GOP is headed for being a minority party for a decade or more. '

'> I never said “give teachers guns” like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @NBC. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving “concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A “gun free” school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END! https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump\n\n\\-\n\n> special training experience\n\nMost teachers can\'t even afford to finish their studies because they don\'t have the money to pay for the upper diplomas, have no time to pull in a third job to refund their older student loans, and are paid minimal wage for 50+h/week in reality (that is when they aren\'t "unpaid interns" and have no income so trying to force them to buy military training on top lolz).\n\nTeachers are never gonna find time nor money to afford para military training (which of course the republicans apparently hope to charge them in the name of "profit making"), and it\'s not their job; and we\'d have more result giving them complete teacher training to begin with.\n\n> would also serve as a deterrent \n\nNo it wouldn\'t. Suicide attackers aren\'t the sanest persons on earth.\n\n> would now be able to immediately fire back\n\nNo they wouldn\'t because they wouldn\'t know who would be the shooters, and if anything the police then wouldn\'t know anymore who is a shooter and if that is the NRA\'s hallucination of a "good guy with a gun" that\'s shooting in front of them.\n\nThe only results is that you\'d have 10x more bodies, once again.\n\n> ....History shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes.\n\n\nThat\'s absolute, complete nonsense. Whoever told you that is an idiot and a liar\n\n> the sicko will NEVER attack that school.\n\nSickos attack military bases in afghanistan and iraq too.

'Somebody please explain to me how it is at all acceptable that Trump is off taking family photos with Putin, instead of signing that Sanctions bill congress sent to him on our behalf? That was a bipartisan bill, something very rare these days. He did say he would sign it, right? This is outrageous. He had as well claim his allegiance to Moscow. He doesn\'t understand, this is not another a Trump business. Trump works for us now. This is a job, with a salary. Our representatives acted on our behalf, and he is refusing our demands. He is either a coward who is unwilling to stand up to Putin for attacking our democracy, or Putin has control over our president, and the United Stated is now pushing a Russian Agenda. This is treason, for real. I know that only applies during a time of war, but what do you people think this is that is happening? **We are being attacked**, war is being waged against our very **democracy**, and Trump is aiding our enemy. They literally scrubbed "to promote freedom and democracy" from the United States mission statement. He should be protecting us, and signing that sanctions bill, pronto, but instead he proposes we abandon our values, and just toss our allies aside to support and endorse a brutal Russian regime who is nothing less than our mortal fucking enemy. Putin has not yet shown that he is even willing to do what it takes to lift there already existing sanctions. This guy is a fucking **MORON** people. '

The Soviet Union was behind North Vietnam in our proxy war with the communist Soviets. Thousands Americans dead.\n\nIt’s sad.

"It's 2017 and America is still stealing Native American land. We need to have a revolution in America and establish a multi-racial and multi-class democracy to stop the looting of America by the GOP."
"Can we just take a minute and realize that Trump has his own park, and it's a pile of shit? Why not give that up? \n\nIn all fairness, [I visited this site](https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/hisnps/NPSHistory/national_monuments.pdf), and noticed that no recent GOP president designated any large national parks. As a whole, they may not support them at all. I seem to remember their belief is that land, and all its resources, are 'gifts from God', and meant to be 'used', not just sit and be left alone and admired. "
'I\'m reading the official [white house press release](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/12/04/president-donald-j-trump-stands-local-communities-against-government) and it bothers me so much how fucking partisan, opinionated, and unprofessional it sounds.\n\ne.g., language like "past administrations have abused" and Grand Staircase being designated by Clinton "largely for political purposes".\n\nobviously this isn\'t news to anybody anymore...but I\'m finding it infuriating still.'
"Okay. I did some research. Here's what I found + a TIL.\n\nTIL: A President has never reversed the creation of a predecessor's Monument, and an opinion written by the U.S. Attorney General in 1938 suggests a President may not do so.  \n\n1. Yes, there are multiple governing bodies that oversee   monuments. \n\n2. There are multiple acts the monuments were formed under.

'Wtf, a few bureaucrats in Washington aren’t “controlling” the land. As I understand it the land was being protected *for* public use and *against* destruction by big oil, gas, mining, what have you. So now I guess the state will sell/lease the land to the highest bidders to totally rape it.'

'Here\'s another thing that\'s been bothering me about the Trump side\'s story about this meeting: \n\nThe story is that Goldstone *abused* Trump\'s relationship with the Agalarovs and set up a meeting that turned out to be a huge waste of time. \n\nThey\'ve talked on and on about how scrappy and starved for time they were and what a HUGE inconvenience this meeting was because it was pointless. \n\nAnd yet, there seems there was no further communication from the Trumps back to the Agalarovs saying "Hey your manager is setting up super sketchy meetings under false pretenses using your name."\n\nI would expect that\'s a fireable offense. So why is Goldstone still employed by them? Why did the Trumps say nothing to the Agalarovs? '

"Rohrabacher, Browder's recent Visa snafu, the meeting with the Russians, it's all lining up. Don Jr. is fucked. Here's hoping he takes the rest with him."
'So this is what the sleazy fuckers are trying to hide behind "Uranium One."  Absolutely pathetic. '
"So let's get this straight. A Russian Lawyer and spy, acting on behalf of the Kremlin, give a memo to a GOP congressman that includes dirt on Clinton. Two months later, the same memo is given to the Trump campaign just as Trump declares that he has dirt on Clinton that he will share publicly soon. This is premeditated. This is a conspiracy to commit a crime. Trump, Trump Jr., French Hill, Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner are criminals. "
"this explains the rabid nonsense over the debunked clinton-russia uranium nonsense they have been so desperately trying to spread. If it wasn't for Hillary they would have nothing at all to talk about. "
"Eyy, I feel like it's been a little bit since we had a Friday Surprise from NYT/WashPo (or I may just not have been paying attention).\n\nHot damn though, that June meeting with Fredo (Donnie Jr.) is looking worse and worse for team Trump with every new piece of news that comes out about it."
'Sorry guys, the news media is more concerned about a no export uranium deal that Clinton had no involvement with. Documented collusion with a hostile power will have to wait.'
'TO ME, the biggest take home point is this basically seals the deal on modus operandi.  \n\nRussia uses proof of dirty finances/money laundering as kompromat.  \n\nWe see it here. We saw it with Manafort.  \n\nWhat is the liklihood that in ALL of Trump\'s dealings with Russia, he wasn\'t involved?  \n\nZero. The answer is zero.  \n\nGive it 6 months - the argument will change to "I didn\'t realize I was laundering money"  \n\nWhich we know, is a legally unacceptable defense.  \n\nBut now the question becomes, even though he\'d be legally culpable, would congress impeach someone that (in their twisted minds\' opinions) made an "honest mistake"  \n\nthis part has me worried. sigh.'
"Come the fuck on, it's comical at this point. The president of the United States is compromised to the fucking russians. Twenty years ago this would be so absurd no one would believe it. And here we are, a fat, orange, traitor, rapist is the president. Sad."
'"The meeting was about adoptions"... She doesn\'t work for Putin, just one of his top henchmen... etc. etc.\n\nGive me a fucking break.  \n\n"By all accounts, the Trump campaign officials were unimpressed — even baffled — by her 20-minute presentation. “Some D.N.C. donors may have done something in Russia and they didn’t pay taxes,” Donald Trump Jr. said later. “I was, like, ‘What does this have to do with anything?’”\n\nSomething I\'m concerned about is that By taking the meeting they have solicited the help/aid of a foreign government/foreign nationals in the election.  The scary thing is that Veselnitskaya could\'ve just showed up to the meeting and said, "Hello, you have all just committed felonies and the Kremlin is aware of this."  Not saying that happened but holy fuck it\'s true.  And that\'s just solicitation.  If an actual deal was made... ho shit mo\' fugga. '
"Who knew that a Russian government lawyer who was part of the Russian government and its efforts to help the Trump campaign would be a Russian government lawyer who was part of the Russian government and its efforts to help the Trump campaign?\n\nSuch a shocker. What a puzzle this whole thing is, so confusing to poor Lindsey Graham who can't put his finger on why Trump would be ignoring his constitutional duties to implement a law signed by Congress that happens to hurt daddy Putin.\n\nClearly the answer to this conundrum is to open no less than a dozen investigations into wrongdoing by Snowball, I mean, Hillary Clinton."
'We are watching blackmail happen in real time folks. Consider the timing. The White House reluctantly just gave names to congress YESTERDAY for sanctions. Today the Kremlin released details about the meeting which makes Trump’s version look less truthful and they’re hinting at more info to come. I don’t believe there’s so much a direct line to the White House as much as there’s an understanding that Putin has dirt on Trump and he’s willing to use it. Parts of the dossier have been confirmed  by Congress to be true and there is no doubt that this pattern will continue as Trump is forced to make moves against the Kremlin. '
'>The memo that Ms. Veselnitskaya brought to the Trump Tower meeting alleged that Ziff Brothers Investments, an American firm, had illegally purchased shares in a Russian company and evaded tens of millions of dollars of Russian taxes. The company was the financial vehicle of three billionaire brothers, two of them major donors to Democratic candidates including Mrs. Clinton. By implication, Ms. Veselnitskaya, said, those political contributions were tainted by “stolen” money.\n\n>Kremlin officials viewed the charges as extremely significant. The Ziff brothers had invested in funds managed by\xa0William F. Browder, an American-born financier and fierce Kremlin foe. Mr. Browder was the driving force behind a\xa02012 law passed by Congress\xa0imposing sanctions on Russian officials for human rights abuses.\n\n>The law, known as\xa0the Magnitsky Act, froze Western bank accounts of officials on the sanctions list – including Mr. Chaika’s deputy — and banned them from entering the United States. It was named after\xa0Sergei L.\xa0Magnitsky, a tax lawyer who had worked for Mr. Browder and who died in a Moscow jail after exposing a massive fraud scheme involving Russian officials.\n\nI could have sworn they only talked about adoptions 🤔🤔🤔\n'

Which morphed into "we __expected__ to collude with Kremlin-tied Russians but didn\'t because reasons."  Which in turn became "we didn\'t get from those Kremlin-tied Russians what we were hoping to get from it."  \n\nFor fuck sake, just cut to the end and say "Yeah, we colluded with the Kremlin but ... but ...

"Here's the problem: the family separations were a direct result of Trump's zero-tolerance policy on illegal entry.

All of them. And the law says when you detain an adult pending prosecution, their children must be held separately.\n\nThis order doesn't rescind the zero-tolerance policy. It merely directs the DOJ to keep families detained together pending prosecution of the adult. Which is illegal.\n\nBut when the Trump administration loses the  inevitable court challenge blocking the illegal detention of children with their parents, they will surely blame the Democrats, or the plaintiffs, or the media, or whoever they can for separating families.\n\nDon't let them. The root cause of this tragedy is Trump's zero-tolerance policy on illegal entry. Zero-tolerance policies are never a good thing, precisely because of consequences like this. Zero-tolerance policies are lazy copouts masquerading as leadership. We should demand better from our government.\n\nObama's administration, by contrast, made a conscious decision not to criminally prosecute families for illegal entry, but to deport them instead, precisely to avoid having to separate them. Trump's administration could have continued that policy. They have not.\n\nSome will argue that Obama's policy represented a loophole for would-be illegal immigrants to exploit. And it was. But they allowed the loophole, because they weren't sociopaths.\n\nThis tragedy is all of Trump's doing. He must be made to own it. Don't let this political stunt distract from that."
'As Josh Marshall of Talkig Points Memo points out, this is a ploy to get a judge to rule that indefinite detention of families is illegal, which will "force him" to bring back the current situation.\n\nhttps://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/trumps-ploy'
"I'm sickened to my stomach at some of the comments defending Trump on this one. Some claiming that it's the right thing to do when it absolutely is not. We're not talking separation because they've caught an illegal immigrant with a huge criminal record, we're talking separation of families *because* of the act of attempting illegal migration. That isn't a justifiable reason to inflict childhood trauma on a completely innocent party (a child no less). If you really think that's morally right then you must be a real trash human being."
'Trump decides to shit on the floor instead of the toilet. After people telling him that is wrong he goes back to shitting in the toilet.\n\nTrump Supporters: Why are people not giving him credit for shitting in the toilet instead of the floor! All you people do is complain!'
'Trump says "You have to take the children away" and gets his ass roasted for it.  He finally figures out he\'s done something monumentally stupid and wants to sign an EO, which wasn\'t actually required to fix his fuck up, and the glass lickers show up and say "He\'s saving the children". \n\n\n\n\n Arsonist sets house on fire, grabs garden hose.  "Look at the hero".'
" After denying the policy existed, blaming Democrats for it, saying he couldn't do anything about it, defending it as good policy, and calling immigration an infestation, he finally caves to members of his own party and cabinet who convinced him it would be bad for his poll numbers.  What a hero!\n\nNo, actually, the people we should thanking for this policy ending are the journalists and the members of the media who brought the story to light.  We should be thanking the protesters.  We should thank anyone who condemned this on social media and contacted their representatives about it.  We should be thanking the Democrat congressmen who went to these sites to expose what was going on.  \n\nThe people made this change happen, not Trump."
'the mental gymnastics is astounding.... wtf is wrong with this admin?\nworst is that his parrot supporters regurgitate it all, because he said so.'

'Of the many things that infuriate me about this president this irritates me the most. He lies to the American people so easily and so frequently. All policy issues aside no one can argue that he isn’t either an absolute imbecile or a pathological liar.'
"I can't tell when whether he's a liar, dumb, or clueless about his own policies. He can't possibly be running things based on what he says because I think someone else is making decisions and he signs some piece of paper not knowing what he signed. \n\nNow it blew up in their face and bam, another order to avert further controversy. This administration is malicious and dumb, a horrible combination. "
"Can someone explain why it's so difficult to just give all current illegal immigrants with no criminal background citizenship, and make the process to become a US citizen quick and easy?"
'I hate living in a world where lies about easily checked facts are tolerated and allowed to propagate '
'No shit. Now actually do something about him America. \n\nRevolt. Hit the streets. Block people from entering the capitol. Where are you balls at to do something about this orange idiotic monster!?'
"Fucking asshole.  Fuck him and his family.  \n\nWhy is our country letting this shit happen?  I worry that this is backlash for having elected a black president.  He wasn't perfect, but he did make his mark, whether you agree with what he did or not - it's all dialed back and recinded now anyway.\n\nWhat has happened to civility and normal discourse?   I don't know all the politics behind this, but McConnell and Ryan, in my mind, have some explaining to do.  But why is no one holding these elected officials accountable?  If they are being held accountable,  please tell me what is being done, because don't see it!"
'Just go with me on this one... Did anyone else have an older brother who used to play the "Why are you hitting yourself" game? When we were kids my brother would grab me by the arm and force it towards my head all the while repeating "Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself?" It was never truly violent, it was childish roughhousing. We would laugh a little, I\'d tell him to stop, and we\'d move on to something else.\n\nNow think about how the situation would look if my brother had actually been violently forcing my arm into my face, over and over. Imagine his intent was to cause real, lasting, serious damage. Lets say he ignores my pleas for him to stop, and he continually chooses to hit me in the head over and over.\n\nThen about five weeks into the beatings lots of people are telling him over and over that he needs to stop hitting me and his reply is that he hates the fact that I keep getting hit in the head over and over, but he can\'t actually do anything about it. He says it\'s the neighbor kid\'s responsibility to stop the beatings by agreeing to give his bike over to him. Naturally this is insane, but it\'s his story and he keeps repeating it.\n\nThen another week goes by, and under intense pressure to stop beating me in the head, my brother finally decides he\'s going to stop beating me in the head. He makes a big show of how he\'s decided to stop beating me in the head, but he still wants the neighbor kid to do something about this bike situation. \n\nNow the correct question to ask is "Why the Helll did it take you six weeks to stop beating your brother in the head, you maniac?" And another is "Why would you lie about having no control over the situation when all you had to do was choose to stop beating your brother in the head?" Do any of you see where I\'m going with this?'
'Trump is a lying twat. '
"Strange that he suddenly ended what he said he couldn't end. I thought you cons said this was all Dems and Trump couldn't end it without action by the Dems...the silence from you bleating fools is defeating."
'So you’re saying that President Pumpkin is either lying, or that he’s totally incompetent? Makes sense to me.'
'And now he is only doing it for PR and poll numbers not because he actually cares.  He hates having to be forced to do it because it makes him look wrong and weak...which he is.'
"SHOCKER he has no idea what he's doing and just makes shit up"
'Now families will be detained together in the same facility *until* the adults get charged with the "crime" of crossing the border, which is what the zero tolerance policy prescribes. It used to be a civil violation before Sessions\'s policy. Once the adults are criminally charged, their kids will be taken away and either (1) be placed in kiddie internment camps or (2) face expeditious removal from the country without their parents.\n\nSo, how does the EO end family separations?'
'Can a reporter just ask him, “how can you not end something that your administration started?” And hold him to the goddamn question???'
'This is insanity. Now you see how he managed to go bankrupt owning a casino.'
'Fucking LIAR.  Should fucking resign today.'

'Is there a precedent for a mayor explicitly telling a President not to come to their city? This seems like an uncommon occurrence.\n\nedit: two things\n\n1) Bush and Cheney were threatened with arrest for war crimes but nothing came of it, a bunch of mayors went way farther and explicitly called the Obama family apes/monkeys, and a few other less notable examples. This is a rhetorical question now.\n\n2) People are speculating that this is to distract from the [North Carolina gerrymandering hearing](http://commoncausenc.org/hearings/). That is a distinct possibility.'
'I mean, it\'s not like Trump cares, right? This isn\'t big enough to prick his ego. We\'ll probably see a tweet in a few hours going "Failing Phoenix Mayor says I\'m not welcome. Sad!" or something like that.'
"Also... why the fuck does he keep having rallies? That alone should be cause for consternation. I don't remember this much constant circle jerking from any other president. I hate him."

"He's not welcome in any US city as far as I'm aware. Maybe in a couple US shit holes "
"They really need to stop with these extremely editorialized headlines. The mayor didn't say he wasn't welcome. He said he should delay his visit. "
"Say what you will about Trump, but a mayor telling the president he isn't welcome in his city just seems childish and unprofessional to me."
"This is why Democrats have been losing since 2008, and will continue to lose.  Hardly anyone here will even understand that the country is fed up with partisan nonsense, and the Democrats are on steroids.\n\nThe mid-terms will be a blood bath, and many here won't understand why - this is why."
"Can anyone tell me why this dipshit is still having campaign rallies? What's he campaigning for? Biggest idiot?"
"The headline is misleading and sensationalist. The mayor essentially asked Trump if he could come back later after people have cooled off. He's concerned that violence might break out and is hoping to mitigate that. Whatever his words implied, he definitely didn't outright say that he's not welcome like many comments here seem to think"
'WTF is he still holding rallies? You got elected now stop wasting money and get to work!'
"Holy fuck, we're over an hour into the speech, and there is literally nothing new of substance.  He has said the same wrong things that he's said in every other speech and whined about how the media hurts his feelings while pretending he did what he didn't do.  Christ he's an embarrassment"

"It's appalling to me how stupid the president of the United States is. He talked about Roseanne's ratings! What kinda ignorant fuck thinks that should even be on a world leaders radar? I feel like we're living in a fever dream of a hyper narcissist that no one can wake up."
'>2:59 p.m. — “Even look at Roseanne! I called her yesterday! Look at her ratings! Look at her ratings! I got a call from Mark Burnett, he did The Apprentice, he’s a great guy. He said, ‘Donald, I called just to say hello and to tell you, did you see Roseanne’s ratings?’ I said, ‘Mark, how big were they?’ They were unbelievable! Over 18 million people! And it was about us! They haven’t figured it out! The fake news hasn’t quite figured it out yet! They have not figured it out! So that was great. And they haven’t figured it out. But they will. And when they do, they’ll become much less fake. May take a while, but it’s happening.”\n\n\nAnd ... um.   What the fuck did I just read?!'
'Jesus Christ... I am so incredibly tired.  When will this shit finally end?'
'The problem is his disapproval rating has barely budged in months. It\'s hovering at 50%. It\'s not great, but it should be way higher.\n\nAnd the problem is NOT the die-hard, Trump nutters. They aren\'t going anywhere and it\'s not surprising they don\'t care about his lies. These people are awful. We should expect nothing from them.\n\nThe problem lies with the moderates. There is a good chunk of the middle of the American political spectrum that thinks "both sides are bad; every politician lies; I wish people would stop shouting on both sides." This is the attitude that is killing us slowly. \n\nYou never have to worry about people joining the fascists. You have to worry about the people who don\'t seem to care that there are fascists gaining power.'
'I know it\'s a slippery fucking slope to say something like this, but can\'t we get some sort of check in place somewhere that punishes politicians for blatantly and knowingly lying to mislead on a regular basis?\n\nI understand getting shit mixed up and letting a fib fly every now and then. I know humans are fallible, but having the top position in the US government so brazenly lying with absolutely no real blowback is getting exhausting.\n\nRight now, journalists are pretty much the final line stopping this behavior from being completely accepted, and a huge sector of people are now decrying everything that they say that doesn\'t align with their worldview as "fake". It\'s going to be too late to fix this shit soon, if we already haven\'t passed that point.'
'Trump is just so completely toxic for our Democracy.\n\nif I were Vladimir Putin and I wanted to destroy America, i’d work to install a compromised chaos agent such as Trump in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump is Putin’s crowning achievement.'

Waiting periods. Only sales through licensed dealers. Every gun is registered, no exceptions. No kids can own a gun period.

'It is fitting that “Why so serious?” was asked ten years ago, I remember I was restless; simply awaiting the next comic book film to release, talking comics, fishing, working out, I did not care about the future. I wasn’t serious about anything. I saw the world at war and thought everything was a joke. I had no interest in politics. The main thing I knew was The Dark Knight was out and how awesome it was. It is common knowledge that adults and youth at the time were obsessed with the portrayal of a character in comic book mythos: The Joker. As an anarchist, he proceeded to carve a path through the fictional city of Gotham. At one point The Joker asked with a silent, roaring intensity “Why, so serious?”. In that moment, a question became a statement that defined an entire generation.\n\nThat statement, while fictionally-sourced, struck a nerve worldwide and the apathetic nature it evoked can be seen to this day. However, that was never enough for me. In those ten years I sailed around the world as a United States Sailor, was trained by arguably the best Intel community in the world, worked towards my degree in International Politics, worked with both the United Nations and World Bank as an independent consultant. The world was not what I was led to believe. With that in mind I then started to look at America like I did everywhere else. What I found disturbed me.\n\nIn 2011 I left the Republican party as there was only so many times I could have been told that (insert elected official) was coming for my guns and all the other hateful rhetoric Fox “news” spread. That hateful rhetoric that is still here. In the last three years I cannot impress upon you enough how many variations of the phrase “Fuck your feelings snowflake.” I have heard. Vile racist behavior is out in the open and when confronted, you will hear variations of the same thing “It was just a joke” and “Why so serious?”\n\nI sat back as opinion somehow became “facts”. I also saw fear and misinformation win with little effort. I saw a charlatan, clear as day, use that fear and misinformation to galvanize an electorate. I watched as, then Presidential nominee, Trump mocked a gold star family. I watched as, then Presidential nominee, Trump mocked a disabled reporter. I watched, as then Presidential nominee, Trump mocked American Prisoners of War (POWs). I watched and brought up these articles, sources (1-42), and was ridiculed for my efforts. Then James Comey was fired and obstruction was introduced into the game. The President of the United States told Russians that his firing of Comey would ease up pressure on them. The President of the United States also verbally assaulted the FBI and James Comey through twitter. James Comey testified and gave evidence that The President of The United States asked him to drop his investigation into Mike Flynn. In not doing so, James Comey and the FBI were, again, verbally assaulted by The President of The United States. (43,44)\n\nEven with all this going on, The President of The United States still had time to continue to lie that one of our biggest trade partners is sending over only rapists, killers and criminals. Stating that they are going to pay for a wall on our border. He also actively called them “our enemy” when they have never been. In doing this, Trump not only gave credence to the idiots of this country to believe that those of Latin descent were in fact criminal, he also strained relations with the government of Mexico.\n\nThe President of The United States has further alienated our other allies to the point of exclusion from deals with the European Union, as we are now seen as an unreliable ally. The EU also began to form their first army due to Americas actions. We are losing on trade deals and that will negatively affect our economy. Making matters interesting is our allies saying it has been easier to reach better deals without America involved. What happens to America when the world moves on without us? Also, let’s not forget the Human Rights Watch has openly singled out Trump for his encouraging oppression. [52]\n\nAt this point I am not even halfway through everything this administration has done and yet, even to this day, it continues. This last Friday The President of The United States ordered the Attorney General to fire the second FBI director investigating him. After months of The President of The United States attacking his own Intelligence Community and Department of Justice.\n\n“Chuck, it is serious.” Senator Patrick Leahy’s hand-written note said. Three simple and yet for some excruciatingly hard to say words, it. is. serious. I feel like many of us have said those words numerous times since 2015. That three years feel like a lifetime ago is a testament to how exhausting it is. The last decade has been a whirlwind in that sense.\n\nIn this decade, I have witnessed all of this and spoke up, only to be asked (and to paraphrase what Pat and others have said many times to me) “Why so serious?”. For over ten years I have heard that statement, that question, and let it go unanswered. Allow me to rectify that mistake. Why so serious? It is because The President of The United States is a Russian asset.\n\nEdit: fixed wording on quote - bullhorn_bigass thank you also love the name.'

'People need to know that it wasn\'t Mueller that decided on the raid on Cohen yesterday.  Other than Rosenstein, another decision maker on the raid was Geoffrey Berman, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York.  Mueller simply "referred" the evidence to Geoffrey Berman\'s office.\n\nGeoffrey Berman [donated $5400 to Trump\'s campaign](http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/371309-trumps-pick-for-ny-prosecutor-scrutinized). Not only did Trump pick Berman, but [Trump also personally interviewed Berman](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/19/politics/trump-us-attorney-interviews/index.html) before hiring him. The CNN article notes "US attorney candidates rarely -- if ever -- meet with the presidents who will nominate them."  Berman is also [the former law partner of Rudy Giuliani](http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/371309-trumps-pick-for-ny-prosecutor-scrutinized). \n\nThis looks really bad for Trump.  His own pick, who donated $5400 to his campaign, who he also personally interviewed, who was also a law partner with Rudy Giuliani, decides to give the go ahead for the raid on Cohen.  Think about that for a moment.\n\nEdit: People are saying ABC News is claiming Berman had recused himself from the Cohen raid: https://twitter.com/jonkarl/status/983734168134864898'
'>Mr. Trump considered firing Mr. Rosenstein last summer. Instead, he ordered Mr. Mueller to be fired, then backed down after the White House counsel refused to carry out the order, The New York Times reported in January. Mr. Trump is now again telling associates that he is frustrated with Mr. Rosenstein, according to one official familiar with the conversations.\n\n\nCongress needs to act to prevent Trump from plunging us into a constitutional crisis.\n\nEdit: listening to Lindsay Graham defend Mueller and Trump - “[Trump] has told me numerous times he did not collude with the Russians.”\n\nThe sheer gall of the man who started his political career on the birther conspiracy theory now whining about how everyone is conspiring against him '
'Lindsey Graham on CNN right now: "I\'m not worried about Trump firing Mueller.  He\'s smarter than that.  I\'m not worried about it.  I\'m going to do everything I can to make sure Mr. Mueller can do his job without political interference.  I wish there was a special counsel looking at FISA abuses."\n\nBull fucking shit.  This dude is as corrupt and complicit as the worst of them.  Never trust a thing that comes out of any Republican\'s mouth. '
"> The president has for months been harshly critical of Attorney General Jeff Sessions for having recused himself in the Russia investigation. Mr. Trump renewed that criticism Monday night, saying that ***“he made what I consider to be a very terrible mistake for the country***, *but you’ll figure that out.”*\n\nDonald Trump seems to confuse what's bad for him as bad for the entire country, which is the exact diametric opposite of the truth.\n\n"
'Trump calls everything a witch hunt by the Democrats but 90% of those ordering the investigations and even carrying them out are Republicans and many of them appointed by Trump himself.If Trump were actually innocent, he would be WANTING Mueller to look under every rock so he could boast when nothing was found.\n\nHe is guilty as hell so he has to go on the offensive and call everything a witch hunt so when they find him out, he can try and claim it was made up.'

Mr. Trump is now again telling associates that he is frustrated with Mr. Rosenstein, according to one official familiar with the conversations.\n\n>While Mr. Rosenstein must sign off on all moves that Mr. Mueller makes, that is not necessarily the case for searches — like this one — that are carried out by other federal law enforcement offices. Justice Department regulations require prosecutors to consult with senior criminal prosecutors in Washington — but not necessarily the deputy attorney general — before conducting a search of a lawyer’s files.\n\n>The involvement of Mr. Rosenstein and top prosecutors in New York in the raid of Mr. Cohen’s office makes it harder for Mr. Trump to argue that his legal problems are the result of a witch hunt led by Mr. Mueller. In addition to Mr. Rosenstein, all of the top law enforcement officials involved in the raid are Republicans: Mr. Mueller, Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. Director, and Geoffrey Berman, the interim United States attorney in New York.\n\nI mean, I don't see how we get through this without Rosenstein/Sessions/Mueller/SOMEBODY getting fired. Ugh."
'Damn Democrat-pushed witch hunt led by Trump appointed Republicans. Clearly Obama, Clinton, and Soros held Rosenstein down and forced him to sign. They had to do it quick though. They had a lizard person orgy to get to.'

'It’s as if he was daring, double-daring the illiterate evil orange clown to fire him. '
"Fucking hell, why don't they let prosecutors do their job and nab this traitor and his entire network without the fear of being fired.\n\nWhy do they report shit like this? Don't they know that Trump only gets his information from fucking TV? Do they want Rod Rosenstein fired? Because that is precisely how you get him fired. "
'Was googling how the deputy attorney general gives their 2 week notice and this was at the top of the list.\n\nA country shouldn’t be holding its breath waiting for a savage outburst from their president.  It’s like we’re kids with a crazy angry alcoholic dad and everyone is suddenly worried he’s going to literally kill Rod when he comes home.\n\n***** that, I’m Team Rosenstein'
'>  Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your Rod and Your staff, they comfort me.'
"This raid is so serious you have to wonder now if Trumpo will ever fire Mueller, Rosenstein or Sessions. Maybe he's delaying it by a few days to avoid the OOJ blowback an immediate firing would provoke, or maybe not. \n\nAt what point can we assume it just isn't going to happen? End of the month? "

'How is this not a big story? Holy shit, they even have the emails. \n\n>\tAs the discussions continued, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and others began pushing legislation that would take the decision on whether to lift sanctions out of Trump’s hands and put Congress in control, a development that Novatek apparently recognized as a threat given that Broidy’s power to affect policy lay in his presumed influence with Trump.\n\n>In January 2017, Baev wrote to Broidy asking whether McCain’s bill would put their efforts at risk. “The client is asking how our road map would be affected by a new bill sponsored by Senator McCain to codify the existing sanctions and to impose new ones as a matter of federal law which the Administration will not be in a position to lift without consent of the US Congress. What are your thoughts on this?”\n\n>Broidy responded: “We need to convince McCain to abandon or water down the bill while we push the admin and other members of Senate to water down and vote no. Not a game changer.'
"Usually things are a bit more... nebulous. Holy shit. \n\nI actually chuckle sometimes at how right wing conspiracy theories and FUD often pale in comparison to the reality of their shit.\n\nIn all seriousness, while I understand that bribing porn stars to keep affairs secret and the rest of it is unethical and juicy, and there are other important stories, this is just so black and white.. Why the *actual fuck* is this not plastered on the front page of every legitimate news page? More directly comparable, why endlessly pontificate on wishy washy as-of-yet inconclusive details of investigations when bombshells like this are just sitting there? Obviously Fox won't touch it, but what about actual news organizations?"
'The leaks are coming hard and fast now.\n\nI think this investigation is at a tipping point. Trump will either squash it soon (hopefully at his own peril), or Mueller will drop the hammer soon.\n\nBoth sides are starting to really accelerate their timelines. We are at a very dangerous crossroads in American history.'
">Broidy and Baev did not dispute the authenticity of the exchanges but said the deal was never consummated.\n\nIt doesn't matter, you attempted to make the deal. That's illegal in and of itself."
"Jesus fuck that's bad. Broidy is beyond fucked, and good riddance to him."
'>Broidy responded: “We need to convince McCain to abandon or water down the bill while we push the admin and other members of Senate to water down and vote no. Not a game changer."\n\nlol these dolts really thought that once Trump was King that they could just fucking do whatever they wanted.  Broidy is in serious legal peril, especially with Nader flipping.  Good.'
"Silly question, but isn't this pretty similar to what former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich went to jail for? Trying to sell Obama's senate seat to the highest bidder? \n\nYou're essentially doing X in exchange for Y, in this case, lifting sanctions for money. "
"That's...that's it?  They were willing to sell sanctions on Russia for $26M?  That's not even enough to buy one bomb.  If we're going to have a malicious President, I want one competent enough to hurt other bad guys too.  This is a joke."

'>But it was a bad deal!\n\nNever once did I see anyone try to explain WHY it was a bad deal.  Especially when all accounts have been that Iran was complying with it.'
"> Trump Has Wrecked One of the Most Successful Arms-Control Deals in Modern History\n\nTrump has wrecked our reputation and credibility with our allies. The word of the United States now depends on who is in the WH! We no longer speak with one voice when talking to allies or adversaries. This has been done to placate Israel and to some extent Saudi Arabia now. Both of them want the US to start a war with Iran. US does not benefit from a war with Iran. A war with Iran will be costly, destabilizing and extremely reckless. It more than likely will inflame a region that doesn't have much goodwill for us to begin with. It will most likely spiral out of control and will benefit China (expand its sphere of influence) and Russia (since it will jack up the energy prices)."
'I think it’s simply incredible and disturbing how many people believe Iran has violated the deal. If this fake news situation doesn’t come to a head this country isn’t going to make it out the other side. Fox is a part of this.'
'The deal wasn\'t about nuclear weapons. Get real. This is grownup talk we\'re having...not mainstream media \'we can work together bs\'.\n\nIf the Iran deal was designed to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, the mullahs\' chief adversaries would have joined the Obama admin in supporting the accord. Since the beginning they saw deal as a threat.\n\nNearly all of the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Israel: lobbied against the deal. They warned that it would allow Iran and allow the regime to spread terror, chaos, and destruction throughout the world because of access to billions of dollars.\n\nAnd our buddies France and Germany who were extremely supportive of the Iran deal...on claims for worldwide security and preventing nukes...have already agreed to massive, multi-billion-dollarbusiness deals with the regime in Tehran...giving them even more billions. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbus-orders-iran/iran-jetliner-deal-could-take-longer-to-complete-airbus-says-idUSKBN1F42B1\n\nAnd thank to the deal\'s sunset provision, which is set to expire in less than seven years...they can build nukes anyways.\n\nThe deal was designed to serve as a fundamental realignment of American regional interests. The Obama administration\'s reckless re-balancing effort sought to tip the scales toward Iran, away from our traditional Middle East allies.\n\nIn the middle of negotiations over the JCPOA, administration figures made grandiose promises about reform in Tehran, none of which came true. They said the deal would reform the fundamental nature of the regime, yet there are no signs of reform from within Iran. Friday prayers still end with chants of "Death to America." The ayatollah who rules the country still calls for the destruction of the United States and Israel. We were told that the billions of dollars in cash offloaded to the mullahs would only be used for domestic expenditures. Instead, the Iranian people are struggling with a currency crisis, while the Iranian regime has quadrupled annual aid to its chief terrorist proxy, Hezbollah.\n\nSince the deal\'s passage, Iran has continued to spread its terror campaign far and wide, from Asia to America\'s doorstep in Latin America.\n\nThe smartest thing to do is bankrupt Iran and that can only be achieved through destroying the deal.\n\nIt would be in our best interest to quit pretending like we live in a world where people aren\'t corrupt or that we can work in peace and harmony with people that desire to murder us or cause proxy wars for money and power.'
"You guys are so cute. I can't even stand it.\n\nNetanyahu presents tens of thousands of documents intercepted by Mossad proving that Iran wasn't abiding by the deal at all.  Trump makes the informed decision to withdraw, an action which will result in the reinstatement of sanctions.\n\nOf course Iran says it's bullshit, but to be clear, in your anti-Trump fervor, you are siding with a brutal regime where women have no agency against the governments of both the United States and Israel.\n\nAnd I'm not even surprised, really. A few days ago the top post in this sub was about North Korea claiming Trump wasn't responsible for the talks there.\n\nTo be clear: in the space of a week, you have accepted the propaganda of the world's two most brutally repressive regimes over the word of multiple democratic governments, just because you hate Trump.\n\nHope you're comfortable with that."

'>What I would say to the Democrats is, "Your first and fundamental mission is to tell people what you are for." Not that you\'re against Trump. Being against Trump doesn\'t get you very far. It will get you some people who hate Trump. But what are you for? \n\nThis cannot be said enough. They can\'t expect to win just because Trump is so blatantly horrible. They must present means of real, aggressive, progressive change.\n\nIf they don\'t, they\'ll lose.'
'What a sobering account anyone can digest without having to read Fire and Fury, Russian Roulette and now Higher Loyalty. What\'s worse is that Russia is using the NRA as a springboard, catapult, whatever metaphor you\'d like, to maximize the likelihood of American insurgency. They\'re playing us like Afghanistan, but the difference is we\'re taking each other out at schools, events and breakfast diners rather than suicide bombs in open markets. They\'re counting on us to eat each other alive. Many wonder, "Why do Muslims kill each other? Don\'t they believe in the same God?" In similar vein, the world will ask, "Why are Americans killing each other? I thought they pledged allegiance to the same flag?"\nWe did, indeed, dear stranger. We did, indeed.'
'Here is what has long bothered me about the man with tiny hands (quoted from the article.)\n\n"Here are the key things people should know about Donald Trump. He comes from a family of criminals: His grandfather made his fortune running whorehouses in Seattle and in the Yukon Territory. His father, Fred, had a business partner named Willie Tomasello, who was an associate of the Gambino crime family. Trump\'s father was also investigated by the U.S. Senate for ripping off the government for what would be the equivalent of $36 million in today\'s money. Donald got his showmanship from his dad as well as his comfort with organized criminals."\n\nRemember, Trump\'s grandfather came to the US to dodge the draft. Trump is a third generation con man, and he conned the GOP, and then the rest of us.\n \n\nEdit: fixed this to third, and Trumps to Trump\'s.'
'"There is Donald Trump the man, who seems to revel in the very worst human values. His closest family members -- including his father and grandfather -- taught him the "value" of unrepentant greed and ambition. He also displays the symptoms of malignant narcissism, as well as sociopathy. In all, Trump is a master of manipulation who leads a political cult."\nThis is a great summation of the man who is running (ruining?) our country and exactly why he is not just bad but very dangerous! '
'What is the point of these articles?  This is how they all actually read:\n\n[Insert someone who has absolutely no influence on anything] suggests that Donald Trump [insert some insanely inflated claim / crime / punishment]\n\nI guess I will take condolence in the fact that people are this desperate that they are resorting to this drivel.'
'>\tAnother factor was the utter failure of journalists to vet Donald Trump. You can read about Barack Obama’s kindergarten playmates in Indonesia by name, the boys he smoked dope with in high school by name and some of the women he dated in college by name. But the New York Times, in the 16 months from Trump’s [campaign] announcement to Election Day, had exactly four references that had “Trump” and “Mafia” in the same story and they were all in passing and inconsequential.\n\nSo much this. The media was so happy to cover all the nonsense, all the bogus outrageous things he was saying, rather than his sordid past. The biggest scoops and scandals were his past, and had they dove into that instead of reality tv fodder, we might have had a larger part of the sane and responsible republicans think twice and either not vote or vote for the most qualified candidate. \n\nClinton could have really hammered him into the ground with his mafia type past, but if the media wasn’t covering it, then she would just look like a loon. If Clinton had half the aggression she displayed after her defeat, her image would have improved. I dont really buy into the notion that she would have come across as cold or bitchy to most people. She would have come across as professional, tough and a strong leader. That debate where he hovered over her was a perfect time for her to call him out, but she didn’t, I think, because she was so worried about what it might look like. I was so disappointed that night when she let him intimidate her like that. All this comes from a really big supporter, even in the prior elections. I did eventually and happily jump on the Obama wagon, as he was just so likeable and relatable.\n \nThe author nailed it though. \n>\tAmerica’s crisis in civic literacy, political polarization, rampant anti-intellectualism, deeply embedded sexism and racism, greed, broken schools and weakened democratic institutions, as well as a hollowed-out public sphere where people confuse celebrity with human worth made the election someone like Trump nearly inevitable.'
'FWIW, David Cay Johnston is the reporter who got the "leaked" tax records that Rachel Maddow made such a huge deal over last year. They hyped it like it was the smoking gun that killed Kennedy, but it turned out to be even worse than nothing. I think it\'s pretty clear that the "leak" came directly from the White House. \n\nJust saying that this guy has a track record of buying way too much into the hysteria and severely overstating the situation. '
'Cue Trump tweet "Drunken loser David Cay Johnson, who has amounted to NOTHING during his Lifetime, has falsely Said that the evidence Points to collusion. THERE WAS NO COLLUSION(Except by the Dems and Crooked Hillary), AND NO EVIDENCE! WITCH HUNT!!! "\n\n(Misspelled last name was on purpose)'
"This guy is a regular on r/politics. Holy shit if he doesn't embody your average uniformed and hysterical poster here. \n\nEvery Republican candidate in 2016 was unprepared for office except for Kasich? The media didn't try to vet Trump? This man is delusional. "
"David Cay Johnston doesn't mention the complicit Republican majority Congress and the cover story, cover up, they plotted with their investigative committees, where the Senate produced a memo calling to arrest Steele, and the House memo by Nunes memo said the opposite of the public lies, the lies that claimed the Steele reports were the only basis for the investigation. "
"I believe in addition to the tax fraud and conspiracy, there's going to be some other illegal activities, namely money laundering and possibly sanctions-busting for Russian criminal entities. Evidence of those crimes are the real kompromat that keeps Trump in Putin's pocket...he can survive the pee tape with only a temporary sped bump, but those other things will get him behind bars."
'Redhats: i dont care who that Pullit Zer guy is, its fake news'
'An interesting note is that Johnston also proved that Trump was not a billionaire years ago. I remember during the election how the Democrats should have pushed this idea. Stop calling Trump a billionaire. The fact that he was being referred to as a millionaire would have infuriated him and pushed him to somehow try to prove this. Alas, Democrats are awful at running campaigns. '

"man, I am really fucking stressed out by the situation here in america and this was an extremely difficult and sobering read. \n\nnothing here was new to me. it was just put very clearly. \n\nI have thought for a long time that there's no way this problem gets resolved without some serious violence, and this just reaffirms my position. \n\nI check for confirmation bias and am left with the same thought. trump has a record of and continues to use people's emotions to to achieve his goals. he manipulates. I witness this with my own eyes. I am a very logical and rational person and I cannot talk myself out of the probability that this of course happens when trump is faced with the prospect of charges. \n\nit is a terrible terrible perfect cocktail that could ignite a revolution in the united states. \n\nthat is fucking terrifying. but I will fight for what is right.

I don't want to hear you telling us that the word is being thrown around too lightly."
"I'm sure that he is but the more important question is whether the US can have a traitor president.  Will he be forced to resign with no charges filed except for those under him?  Personally, I feel that on the world stage there's no way for us to get back anything that we've lost under Trump, with out him serving time in prison."

'As an eagle scout, I am embarrassed that this man used his time in front of the boy scouts to spew hateful divisive rhetoric.  I will be writing the National Council asking for them to disavow the speech.'
'During the campaign Trump supporters loved to defend Trump by saying there was no hate or violence at his rallies except when caused by liberals in attendance (which is bullshit, but I digress). \n\nFor reference, the booing and chanting is exactly the type of hatred that he inspires. was there any actual physical violence there at this exact moment? Probably not. But his speech planted a seed of vitriol that is now growing inside the kids who were susceptible to it, and they\'re going to be just a little bit meaner to other kids who disagree with them from now on.\n\nHe infects everything around him with a deep-seated hatred of "the other".'
'What the fuck is wrong you, sane Republicans.'
"The boy scouts are an organization I both love and hate. I reached life scout (just under eagle) and it had a very positive impact on my life. Then you have the political side, which I hate and find inconsistent with the values they teach. And on a side note, a bunch of eagle scouts from my troop shot one of my cows (and those of other farmers) with a crossbow and left them to die wailing in pain.  \n\nEDIT: they were found out by the police. No real consequences, no. Everything was deferred since they were about to go to college. One kid (not a scout) felt bad enough to work off his debt to us, don't know about the other affected farmers."
'[Read this like John Oliver] \n\nThe first topic tonight is unfortunately once again President Trump. Two words that continue to go together like diarrhea and baby cancer. And boy do we have a lot of catching up to do! but tonight I want to key in on just horrible he is even among the youngest of us. If you haven\'t heard, this past Monday President Trump gave a speech at the Jamboree of the Boy Scouts of America. In an incoherent 35-minute speech, Mr Trump whipped up a response of boos, cheers, chants and jeers as he lambasted fake news, Hillary Clinton\'s election campaign and President Obama\'s failure to address a Jamboree in person. Just take a look (Shows key parts of the speech, then shows him telling the group of children that Obamacare is murder, eliciting cringing and boos from the crowd.)\n\nWhat the actual fuck. He\'s like Anti-James Cameron, instead of raising the bar, just when you thought it couldn\'t get worse, he lowers it and limbos under it. The leader of the country just told a group of children Obamacare is going to kill them, and their families. No president in history has shown such disregard to human ethics.\n\nHe even went on to chastise President Obama for never speaking at that quad-yearly event. While he never went in person, he teleconferenced and gave a wonderful speech to the very last one. Then he went on to disregard Obama\'s care for the Scouts. Can you guess which of these presidents were a Boy Scout? The closest Trump has come to camping is when room service doesn\'t pick up on the first ring.\n\nHis whole speech was just so wholly inappropriate, in fact, that there is no current word that I can think of to properly state how horrible this is, so we made one up! Yes, we made one up! Drumpftated.\n\nHashtag Drumpftated.\n\nBut if you think the story end there, you\'re wrong. Because after the speech, an overwhelming number of parents shouted out how disgusted they were. (shows a bunch of tweets showing just that) There was a lot more to this speech that we didn\'t cover, like him awkwardly bring up his health secretary, Tom Price, to give a thinly veiled threat about firing him for screwing up healthcare reform. To continue touting his "enormous" electoral victory. To even making a joke about the size of the crowd. Parent\'s had every right to be outraged. The Boy Scouts of America, by definition, is a non-partisan organization, designed to help grow and instill good values on our nations youngest men. Among those that came for their ranks include Neil Armstrong, Martin Luther King Jr., Bill Gates, JFK, Bill Clinton, George W Bush, Barack Obama, are you seeing the pattern yet? Like I said before, can you guess who is not on that list? (waits a minute for the audience to call out) Of course it\'s SCROTUS. This is the Scout\'s Oath (Cuts to video of small kids saying the oath): On my honor I will do my best, to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; To help other people at all times; To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.\n\nWe have a man "enriching" these kids who follow exactly none of those core values. And Trump had something to say about the Scout\'s Law. "As the scout law says, a scout is trustworthy, loyal. We could use some more loyalty, I will tell you that." If that doesn\'t make you Drumpftated, nothing will.\n\nAnd now this.'
'Are we allowed to call him straight up dangerous yet? We are past "how it starts" and have moved into "this is how it progresses." Stop. Giving. Him. A. Platform.\n\nEspecially in front of Cub Scouts, who are supposed to be learning how to be leaders. This is seriously fucked up.'

"My son just finished his first year as a Weebelo.  He's going to be a Boy Scout next year.  \n\nI'm personally unsure if I'm going to continue with this organization, after the booing of Obama, and then Trump's behavior.\n\nLook, he is the President of the United States of America.  I get it.  Who wouldn't want that.  It was booked.  They didn't see the shit with the Navy where he basically ordered them to do things.  I get it.  He's a person that doesn't care.  I know.  I get it.  Who doesn't want the President to be there.  He's out of control.\n\nI had E-mail after E-mail to show your BSA pride.  He was at Monticello, and Mt. Vernon, wearing his Boy Scout uniform.  Because this is America, and darn it, if we take him to the home of George Washington, we're going to fly the flag.\n\n**However, just because he wears a brown shirt, I am NOT going to let them make my son into a Brownshirt.  This crap with the BSA has to stop.  I'm about to pull my son.**\nThe organization is becoming more, and more, and more right-wing.  It's getting stupid.  It's acting stupid, and it's been co-opted into something that I'm not quite sure I feel good about participating in.\n\nI don't care if my son votes what he votes at a certain age.  That's his choice, and frankly, I'll probably be so 'out of the loop' on society at that age, I'll be fine with whatever he chooses... probably because I'll see the issues through the lens of an old man.  That's fine.  I'll just warn him exactly about the demagogues that show up.  He's already on top of this, and he's already questioning why people talk so angry all the time.   \n\nAll that being said, and my love for the BSA notwithstanding, **I'll be damned if I'm taking my son to a filming of a new Leni Riefenstahl film for the President.**\n\nThe BSA needs to figure it out, and if they don't, we're done.  One more incident and we're through.  When it comes to the BSA, I'm in the car, and the engine is running."

"This is a total embarrassment to the BSA and the nation.  I would have been enormously proud of the BSA if the leaders had simply cut Trump's microphone the moment he went on the political attack. Instead we have images of BSA adult leaders chanting, cheering and booing just as the Trump script was written.  This is shameful and every BSA adult leader who participated should be immediately dismissed, silly hat and all.\n\nWhat is more embarrassing is the BSA's failure to make an immediate public statement condemning the use of its gathering of children as a political prop.  BSA's phone lines are constantly busy (# on its Facebook page) and its Facebook page is overflowing with comments demanding meaningful action.  Many are commenting to say that they are pulling their sons and their support on account of what appears to be a milquetoast acquiescence in Trump's speech."

"At this point, Congressional Republicans' inaction has made it very clear that either Democrats need to take back Congress, or it'll take a stock market crash caused by Trump volatility, which hurts donors' profits, for Republicans to act. Even then, there's good chance for Republicans to spin the economy crash on Democrats with BS like undermining the President's MAGA economic growth agenda etc...\n\nI've greatly underestimated the greed that has kept Trump in power for so long, in exchange for a tax cut. But when the tax cut fails, a stock market gloom is going to become more evident by the day."
'I hate to say this but is seems that most Americans are suckers and really easy to trick. The terrorists have won in terms of the constant erosion of our civil rights.

'Trump is a perfect example of why you should not elect "businessmen" to govern, especially spoiled, narcissistic, dim witted ones such as Trump.  I would guess in Trumps very limited world view that in order to win in anything such as building a hotel in Moscow or an election in the United States you do whatever it takes, pay bribes to local officials, done, lie to local zoning boards about proposed building\'s dimensions, done, lie in bed with hated competitors, done.  Trump\'s business model includes these practices and many more even more devious and underhanded.  Where is there any surprise in that?  I doubt even his most ardent supporter would argue that in business he is considered a snake and one not to be trusted in giving his word about something.  That\'s how business gets "done" according to Trump.  Do whatever it takes no matter what.  Nothing new or sinister when viewed with a "business" filter.\n\nNow, bring that same attitude to governing and you are a fish out of water.  In business it\'s benefit of the few at the cost of the many and in governing it\'s the opposite, or should be anyway.  This runs against everything Trump stands for and has worked for in his lifetime.  He has never shown any empathy towards any struggling American because he is incapable, it goes against his DNA.  To take from the rich to give to the poor is ludicrous and a waste of money if you examine closely his past business practices and histories.  His whole existence has been to enrich him at the expense of others not share equally the wealth generated by the work of the many.  Even his MAGA platform shouts this in that he claims that America must make other Countries pay more to do business with America.  This is a thinly veiled argument that he will make sure America doesn\'t get "screwed" by other Countries who take advantage of America.  \n\nNow he is elected President and you expect him to change his spots?  Impossible.  He doesn\'t understand you can not lie to people.  Sure you can, in fact you have to to get things done, that\'s the only way shit gets done.  He has absolutely no clue that he couldn\'t operate or cooperate with enemies of the State.  That\'s not collusion, that\'s getting shit done.  He disregards any derogatory story as fake news because it does not reflect him or his administration in the best light.  What Company published news letter have you ever seen that didn\'t sugar coat every article it printed and distributed to it\'s employee\'s?  None.  This seems to be how Trump thinks.  This is why business and governance don\'t mix.     '

"I'm confused. Is this worse than POTUS using Grey Poupon?"
">“I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.”\n\nBush thought he had a good sense for Putin after hearing a sob story about Putin finding a cross in a burned-out dacha, but even he had a rude awakening the more he got to know just how conniving and calculated Putin is. Bush only later realized that Putin, a former spy, had played him and his born again Christian ideology to make a fool of him with a half-baked story about faith that was a godsend for PR relations.\n\nIt was one thing back then-we didn't know much about Putin and his behavior. But this is over a decade later and we know how he governs now, we know about his suppression of journalists and dissidents, and we know about how he allows his FSB to perform false-flag terrorist attacks within his own country to keep the people scared and easily manipulable. Trump's a fool at best, and complicit at worst. \n\nPutin was *literally* trained as a spy. Connecting to people and manipulating is *what he does*. If anyone's interested in more, I'd **strongly** recommend Masha Gessen's *The Man Without a Face*. \n\nSide note, how ironic is it that people who believe 9/11 was an inside job and that our politicians are running a pedophile sex ring in a nonexistent pizzeria basement idolize Putin?\n\nThey refuse to look at or acknowledge evidence that implicates him in the apartment bombings in the late nineties during his first election, as well as in the deaths of many journalists who have investigated that case (an FSB agent *literally* slipped up and had a member of the Duma announce one of the bombs three days before it went off). Or how about the fact that he probably had some role in allowing the Moscow Theater Siege, which left over a hundred dead, to happen? There's got to be a reason why an alleged FSB agent was with the terrorists and slipped out just before the police went in, especially when you realize that several of the terrorists were supposed to be in prison, indicating some extra-legal maneuvering was used to get them out."

"You guys need to understand that a fundamental shift in the global order has happened over the past year.  A northern axis of ethno-nationalist sovereigntist supercorporations embodied by the Russians, its client states, and the now newly isolationist United States.  Notions such as 'law', mores, and morality are all secondary considerations at this point.  Once you realize that power for the sake of power is the order of the day then things will start to make a lot more sense.  Your institutions will not save you.  Your courts will not save you.  Only you, the people can save you, and your people have been trained to hate each other.  One half of your working class has been conditioned to murder the other half if circumstances dictate.  Realize that your military class is not taken from the poorest and most marginalized from among you.  Rather they are a suburban, rich, and white warrior class that sees the 'other' as enemy."

'If Trump is lying, and Putin did not speak about the meddling, then Trump is just a compulsive lying conman. If Trump is telling the truth, Putin is proven to be a liar and his word about not meddling is not to be trusted. Either way, Trump got fucking played. Dude is like the worst deal maker ever. Took an inherited fortune, pissed away the majority of it, pretends to be a billionaire and fails every fucking time he tries something. It took Russians colluding and fucking with our election for him to win. What a loser. Sad.'
'Trump never fails to prove he’s Putin’s cock holster and always at the most inopportune moments.  \n\nWhen it comes to the longstanding question of which a Trump is the dumbest in the family...Donald wins that contest hands down.

'Something important to note on this traitor...\n\nHe is told that the Russian govt is helping the campaign. He responds "I love it".\n\nThen, when news reports start to raise questions about Russians interfering in the campaign, which is illegal, he goes on TV and flatly denies that it\'s happening.  He says the Democrats are disgusting for suggesting such a thing and they can\'t fight fair.\n\nIsn\'t he guilty of misprision of a felony at that point?  He knows that a crime is ongoing and then goes on TV and seeks to hide that very fact.  \n\nSame thing goes for Trump Sr.  He knows the Russians interfered, yet calls it a hoax.  He\'s hiding a crime.  \n\nFor all the other crimes committed, this one seems like the easiest one to pin on them.  '

And with all the skeletons in that family's closet, it's realistic to believe someone is going to get charged big time. Such a threat to national security and national sovereignty won't go by Mr. Mueller easily without a heads rolling, believe that. It won't go by the CIA, NSA and all of the other allied intelligences either. We're about to see the biggest case of Karma being served on Trump and company."

In front of a judge. Where they can\'t change the subject. They can\'t stall for time. They can\'t cancel the press conference.

' I\'m a middle aged fortyish person and I *know* he is all of these things. I don\'t think he\'s a "hurr, preserve the white race" racist, he\'s too lazy for that; he simply thinks non-white people are inferior to him, which is why he\'s ragingly jealous of Obama. \n\nBut it kind of doesn\'t matter to him what he is or isn\'t; he cares only about making money and the dopamine hits of attention this brings him. To narcissists, other people are just commodities to be used, or furniture to be arranged. He found a niche of stupid, racist, intolerant, bloodthirsty, greedy failures of humanity, and he made them viscerally respond to him by suggesting it is okay to be all of those things, and it propelled him to power. And their blind spot is that they don\'t realize he doesn\'t give a ripe fuck about anyone but himself. '

"Actually I think Trump should face their parliament and their public. The derision he'd face would hurt him far more than any ban would imho. This bum deserves to be publicly lambasted."
"His early-morning Twitter frenzy came days after Ms Fransen was arrested over a speech made at a rally in Belfast - the latest in a series of incidents over alleged hate speech, religious harassment and incitement by Britain First members.\n\nIt's embarrassing to see a President spread a message which is the total opposite to the constitution he is swore to uphold and protect."
'Didn’t one of their members kill an MP last year?'
"He should be banned. It is now a legitimate concern for the UK - Trump's presence could rile up far-right hate groups and put the population in danger. For your own sake, UK, ban the orange buffoon."
"Wouldn't it be fantastic if POTUS was banned from all countries? It would suck that he be stuck in the U.S.A - however I don't want to spread his evil to other nations."
'“Trump couldn’t possibly be more racist than when he used a Native American racist slur against a sitting US Senator while talking to some Native American war heroes in front of a portrait of Andrew Jackson, right?”\n\nTrump: “Hold my beer”\n\n(Yes, I know Trump doesn’t drink)'
"Considering he's a documented sponsor of Irish Terrorism, why would he be allowed in the first place?"

'For context Britain first are a third hate group. A third david wolfe and a third westboro baptist church. They are a bunch of football hooligans who got two old to be hooligans\n\nIn Britain we have a symbol. The poppy it symbolises the flowers that grew on flander fields after ww1 .Every year the royal British legion sell the poppy to raise money for veterans and soldiers issues (For example providing improved rehabilitation services for soldiers. Access to employment and housing for disabled veterans etc etc.\n\nBritain first make their own poppy instead of using it to fund things that benefit soldiers or veterans Britain first use it to fund their political activities\n\nThey endless use images of a soldier, lee rigby who was beheaded in an terrorist attack in woolwich despite being asked not to by the famoly\n\n2.)They share memes on facebook to attract followers . make false representation about military links and use British military style insgnia on their publicity. \n\n3.) They exploit tragedies and picket certain events. (For example, they will protest near a soldiers funeral . claiming they are protecting it from muslim protestors)\n\n4.)There was a huge scandal.in the UK where young girls who were ostensibly white girls in care were abused by Asian/Arab men.There have been a number of court cases in which attempts to bring the perpetrators to justice. Britain first have picketed these court cases (despite requests from the families not to) Britain first have made public statements which has risked the integrity of the trial. \n\nDuring these protests they have shouted abuse at who they believe are the perpetrators . however often the perpetrators are sneaked into the court  or are on remand awaiting trial. Because lf this the abuse often is directed at witnesses and prosecutors. It is also intimidating to the victims . apparently, the abuse has been directed at the victims as well because they "had sex" with people who were muslim\n\n5.) In east London there was islamic "modesty patrols "chastising and intimidating women for what they were wearing and for people drinking. The people behind these modesty patrols were relatively quickly arrested and sent to jail/fined for harassment. However in response Britain First launched a Christian patrol, they would go to mosques ,Often the only mosques they would go to were liberal ones who would welcome anyone ,Not the extremist ones (Probably because they would get beaten up ).Anyway Britain first would go in with beer and bacon, claim that if the congregation had a problem with this it was because they were unwilling to integrate. \n\nThere was some famine going on in an muslim country and the mosques were doing a food donation drive. So Britain first donated Bacon. One mosque sent an amazing letter back. Saying thanks for the bacon and that they donated it to a local food bank\n\nBritain first would also drive around areas with high islamic populations in a military green ex military range rover (with fake military isgnia on the side) and chastise people for wearing arabic dress.

But he's just not that smart and he doesn't care about you (Brits or Europeans) enough. He did this for an American audience. I'm sorry it affects you too, but his intent (if he can really be said to have cognition) was to affect things in the US.\n\nPlease ban him from your country. Everyone should. It's too bad the US can't do so also."

Suddenly, with the increased media attention, people were asking wtf was going on in the ocean. Where the sharks being driven towards, shore, maybe climate change.. maybe over fishing.. "FUCK THE BEACH"  but it wasnt even a record year or anything, it was just more media attention of something that didnt use to have a lot.\n\nDid these videos happen.. maybe..  sure could have, have to worry in this day and age about staged crap but sure they could have happened. not saying they are fake. But unfortunately you can probably find that shit in any religion. Humans are humans. Its just we dont seek out the small stories in africa about a christian priest in a small African town poured acid down the throats of kids he thought were witches. If we posted every story like that, people would think christians were going nuts. When it would be nothing but increased media attention.(thats not to say isis didnt happen but so did the iraqi war, with our president "picked by god to bring peace to the middle east".. wanna do a death count? But thats not to excuse ISIS but isis isnt all muslims just like the US attacking iraq isnt all christians.)\n\n\nedit: apparently i upset a trumpet for pointing out when their right winger sites cherry pick stories about shit like illegals running over people they are radicalizing their base, when they dont point out, that per capita that happens less than the general population. Its cherry picked to make the piss-in- their-pants trumpers piss in their pants even more.'

"I was sceptical about the claims of him faking Trump's medical review when it first came out, but the last few weeks have really changed my opinion on it.\n\n\n1 - The WH doctor releases a medical review that sounds Trumpian and uncharacteristically hyperbolic, citing some results that don't pass the sniff test.\n\n2 - Trump later nominates him to a cabinet position he is not qualified for\n\n3 - It comes out that not only is he unqualified, he didn't have even cursory vetting. \n\n\nNumer 1, by itself, was just about believable if you acknowledged he was also Obama's physician and seemed fine then. With 2 and 3, though, it seems hard to deny what actually went on. "
"Obama said he was a good physician also.  But being a good physician doesn't mean you are worth a shit at anything else.  By all accounts Been Carson is a good surgeon, but he is bat shit crazy and a terrible leader at HUD."

I couldn’t—you know, he was right in front of me, and I turned away. I didn’t want to touch him.\n\n>As Stern and company yukked it up at this expertly-delivered punchline, Trump continued.\n\n>[Trump]He’s bleeding all over the place, I felt terrible. You know, beautiful marble floor, didn’t look like it. It changed color. Became very red.\n\n>[Trump]And you have this poor guy, eighty years old, laying on the floor unconscious, and all the rich people are turning away. ‘Oh my God! This is terrible! This is disgusting!’ And you know, they’re turning away. Nobody wants to help the guy. His wife is screaming—she’s sitting right next to him, and she’s screaming.”\n\n>The Marines in attendance, the president explains, swooped in quickly, forming a human stretcher to rush the victim out the room and get him badly-needed medical attention. Meanwhile, Trump adds with a delighted chuckle, he was signaling frantically for a cleaning crew.\n\n>I [Trump] was saying, "Get that blood cleaned up! It’s disgusting!" The next day, I forgot to call [the man] to say is he okay!\n\nYeah....forgot. One of the millions of stories of this guy being a total heartless prick.

It's never been easier to make money off of idiots that are so enthralled in identity politics that they will click on anything they shares their POV.\n\nTalking about how hot his wife is...\n>“You know, Howard, she’s got the kind of a body and makeup where, about one day after the baby, it’s going to be the same as it was before,” Trump said during an appearance on Stern’s show on Dec. 7, 2005.\n\n>“You’re giving her one day?” Stern asked.\n\nJoke\n\n>“One or two,” Trump replied.\n\nAnother Joke\n\n>Moments later, the future president reconsidered. “I think I’ll give her a week,” he said. “No, I’ll give her a week.”\n\n>Trump’s remarks drew laughter from Stern’s female co-host, Robin Quivers, and Trump ultimately indicated that his ultimatum to Melania was not entirely serious.\n\nHow dare he?!!?\n\n>“If there’s cellulite, will you be man enough to stay in the relationship?” Stern asked at one point.\n\n>“I will,” Trump answered. "
"Republicans: yawn\n\nI heard the gop Christian bitch on npr this morning and she didn't give a fuck about Trump moral failings saying we are all sinners. And she still supports him because he's anti abortion \n\nThey're scum of America and I'm glad America is diversifying so bitches like her will get drowned out by immigrant votes."
'Is this supposed to be a shitty hit piece or something? Trump is having fun with Howard Stern on his radio show and unfunny and totally miserable liberals are trying to twist this into some attack.\n\nThe fuck is the matter with you people??'
"Ehhh this one is misleading. He's saying that his guess is it would only take a week to lose it, not putting some kind of ultimatum. I hate the guy, but there's plenty of real stuff to hate, lets be careful grabbing at straws. "
"I mean fucking hell he's saying that she CAN lose the weight in that amount of time.\n\nGive me a goddamn break, /politics. I'm almost as liberal as they come and you're just embarassing us."
'I fuckin dispise Trump but, come on, he said it on Stern? I dont take anything folks say on Stern seriously. Its Radio Jerry Springer. \n\nEither way he is just a fucking garbage human being and degrades all of us... '
"If you can't figure out this guy is a piece of shit from the EVIDENCE presented over the past decade and more, than you're either a puppet, or a complete moron. "
'>\tWhen I visited about two months after his lovely wife, Melania, now 46, gave birth to the couple’s son, Barron, now 10, the infamous germaphobe boasted that after fathering five children, he’d never changed a diaper.\n\n>\tI enthused that Melania, who stood quietly nearby aboard 5-inch stilettos, had lost all her baby weight. Trump corrected me: “She’s almost lost all the baby weight.”\n\n>\tI was embarrassed for the mother of his youngest kid, who ignored the dig.\n\nWhat a genuinely terrible person. '
'The man is a huge shit stain and a sad excuse and waste if a fucking life '
"So it's Melania's fault he cheated. Is that what he's saying?"
'President Daughter Fucker '
"It's a joke. Not a Donald fan, but I'm also not a fan of deliberately misinterpreting jokes. Stop snowflaking and resume outraging over everything that deserves it.\n\n"
'I despise Trump with all of my being, but this is obviously a joke. Quit seizing on shit that\'s spurious, he has _plenty_ of legitimately heinous things you can call him out for. \n\nHonestly, usually the WaPo is killing it, but this almost seems like he hasn\'t said anything shocking enough in the last 72 hours or something so they\'re digging through the archives for stuff they can frame negatively. They\'re better than that. \n\nThe Stormy Daniels stuff is _legitimately_ heinous, but they\'re trying to tack this on as a "and see, he was horrible to his wife during that period too!" but it\'s too much of a reach.

'Trump will start a war to distract the country. Unfortunately young men will have to fight it'
'He will deny it. You don’t understand, he can’t be wrong. His brain is literally not wired to accept fault. If he is wrong, his brain automatically says “uh uh” and he spits out every single gas light defense he can think of. He is disturbed, he is a deeply disordered person. There is no changing him, there is no hope, he will never be any different. \n\nYou want an example, there’s a clip of him mis speaking recently. I don’t know where he was, I literally saw it just on Seth Myers. He meant to say something about the left being too far left and instead he said, by accident, they are too far right. Instead of saying “excuse me, I meant left”. He automatically, and smoothly, said something ridiculous as if he meant to say that. He said like “that’s where they will end up, on the right”\n\nPart of his issue is he is most definitely with the Russians. The other part is he thought he was right by this. He didn’t see it as collusion or treason. And he never will. So everyone trying to help him is telling him to keep his mouth shut but every part of him wants to talk about it. Cuz he doesn’t think what he did was wrong. He will always deny, no matter what evidence is shoved in his face. And if it’s not an all out denial, he will spin it to blame someone else. '
"If Guccifer 2.0 has been unmasked as a Russian Agent why hasn't the NYTimes, WashPost, or the Guardian reported on it? Something doesn't add up. Like I could understand if a small/medium News outlet pushed something that didn't fit the American consensus, but the person who hacked the DNC on orders from Putin and given to Wikileaks who's been named isn't being reported on by the NYTimes seems odd, to say the least."
'What do we call it when an American citizen conspires with a foreign agent to commit crime?  Sedition?  Treason?  Espionage?'
'I dunno... nothing seems to make it harder for him to deny it... Denying it requires his executive time on the shitter and a cell phone thats charged and loaded with the twitter app.\n\nIt might make it more difficult for him to get away with it. But he lives by Roger Stones rule... Deny Deny Deny.'
'>Today the most popular counter-narrative surrounding Guccifer 2.0 concedes that the account was a fake persona but posits that it was created by the DNC to support a false-flag operation implicating Russia. In this theory, advanced in two widely cited anonymous blogs, Guccifer 2.0 was the DNC posing as Russia posing as a Romanian hacker.\n\nSo...\n\n1. Release damaging data from own org with false flag account\n2. Lose election\n3. ???\n4. ...... Profit?\n\n\nWho the fuck does this make sense to? '
"I don't think Trump has the introspection capability to comprehend that he is guilty. \n\nHe is delusional and believes all the bullshit he spouts, the  obvious inconsistencies don't matter\n\n\nHe probably believes that he is a Messiah of sorts fighting the deep state."
"He's going out of his way to make America look weaker and weaker the longer he serves in office."
"I call balogna on Guccifer 2.0's mistake being 'accidental'. Russia has been trying to throw our nation into chaos, and what better way to do so than to have the DNC hacker himself suddenly 'slip up' and forget to use a VPN just as Mueller's team seems to be closing in on Trump.\n\nIMHO Putin has used and abused Trump and his admibistration as much as he can and is now tossing him to the side of the road like a used condom."
"I hate the fact that trump continues to use the House Intelligence Committees lack of findings as proof that there is no collusion. He told them to shut it down solely for this purpose. Its the most obvious bullshit sham I've ever seen, yet he keeps harking back to it as if its the ultimate proof of his innocence and somehow overrides Mueller's investigation. The fact that his supporters keep eating it up is the only thing that's even more infuriating than the stupidity of the statement itself."
'Oh, but he will. His Fox-News-filled cabinet is preparing to increase their propaganda war exponentially.'
'Yeah right. It won\'t be "harder" for Trump or any of his cult. They don\'t operate on facts, they operate on "beliefs" and "feelings". This changes nothing. They\'re brain-damaged and hopelessly lost in propaganda. '
"Harder to deny? This all but damn near proves it. Now it's just a matter of showing evidence of who else was involved and who knew what, when."
"You know, at some point we're going to have to get a lot more serious about holding Congress accountable.\n\nCalling and emailing them isn't enough. I think it's time we protest in front of their offices and their homes. **No violence**, just civil disobedience. Form walls around their homes and offices and refuse to leave. \n\nThey have more than enough reason to impeach now. \n\nThe executive branch may be failing on account of Trump, but our system of checks and balances is failing **because of the GOP in Congress**."

'I was thinking today about the whole "drain the swamp" statement. Having grown up in Southwest Louisiana, that was what sketchy real estate developers would do. You would drain the swamp near New Orleans, without regard for the environment. They would then build expansive housing developments behind fragile barriers that held the muddied  waters of the Mississippi River overhead. \n\nThey would bribe the inspectors so they wouldn\'t have to elevate the houses, as was required for homes built on floodplains. Scientists rose red flags, city planners cried foul, but citizens didn\'t give a damn, they were getting a deal! Politicians got their donations, and everyone shrugged their shoulders when confronted with the danger to people\'s homes, and lives. After all, this was low income housing, and the "important" people were not in harm\'s way. \n\nSo when you hear "drain the swamp", think of the people who died and those who lost everything in Katrina... as the developers and politicians went to their mansions on higher ground. As the people they fleeced drowned below. This is the swamp draining we are getting. We put a crooked building developer in charge of the entire country. '
"Well it's not like literally anyone is going to or even capable of bringing down this systematic and blatant fuck you to the American people. Chalk this up to the fact one day younger generations will probably hate any and everyone who didn't do anything, myself included."

There is nothing more cult like and full of shiat than the american conservative. \n\nOh hillary took money into her foundation from other world leaders and used it to help fight aids in Africa? Obvious pay to play she should be in prison! \n\nTrump is raising fees at his resorts and hiding the visitor logs and is exposed as having new members that include defense contractors, a lobbyist for the South Korean government, a lawyer helping Saudi Arabia fight claims over the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the leader of a pesticide trade group that sought successfully to persuade the Trump administration not to ban an insecticide government scientists linked to health risks. Whats the problem with that?!??!\n\nSeriously Trumpers just do the world a favor and jump off the highest cliff you can find.'
"Disgusting and to think these are the role models of so many.  They're a bunch of mentally ill people who are sick on money and do not deserve a toilet to shit in, rather they deserve to be shat upon."
'Trump voters always knew he was corrupt. Creeping on video, stealing from his own charities, lying about practically everything. Meanwhile the worst they could say about his opponent was that she didn\'t understand how email servers worked. Trump voters never gave a shit about "corruption". Which begs the question, why did they *really* vote for him?'
"I have to keep reminding myself it's illegal to say anything about harming trump. "

"Just gonna leave this here.\n\nFrom Trump's NYT Interview:\n\n>SCHMIDT: Last thing, if Mueller was looking at your finances and your family finances, unrelated to Russia — is that a red line?\n\n>HABERMAN: Would that be a breach of what his actual charge is?\n\n>TRUMP: I would say yeah. I would say yes. **By the way, I would say, I don’t — I don’t — I mean, it’s possible there’s a condo or something, so, you know, I sell a lot of condo units, and somebody from Russia buys a condo, who knows?**\n\n*Reuters Knows*\n\n>In the United States, members of the Russian elite have invested in Trump buildings. A Reuters review has found that **at least 63 individuals with Russian passports or addresses have bought at least $98.4 million worth of property in seven Trump-branded luxury towers in southern Florida,** according to public documents, interviews and corporate records.\n\nAnd that number is *Conservative.*\n\n>The tally of investors from Russia may be conservative. The analysis found that **at least 703 – or about one-third – of the owners of the 2044 units in the seven Trump buildings are limited liability companies, or LLCs, which have the ability to hide the identity of a property’s true owner. And the nationality of many buyers could not be determined. Russian-Americans who did not use a Russian address or passport in their purchases were not included in the tally.**\n \n[Moscow on the Beach](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-property/) (3/17/17)\n\n\n>But one thing the richest among them appear to have in common is the source of their wealth: the distressed assets of economies in the former Soviet Union, sometimes purchased at fantastically low prices or, in the case of the financier behind a Georgian tower that never got off the ground, apparently stolen.\n\nThis Article:\n\n>The most recent post-Soviet oligarch to surface in connection with a Trump project is Mukhtar Ablyazov, the chairman of a bank tied to a planned Trump tower in the Republic of Georgia. **This week’s New Yorker details the abortive plans for two towers in Georgia, and the involvement of Ablyazov, who apparently acquired his vast fortune by simply taking it from a Kazakh bank that since has been seized by that country’s government.**\n\n>**Ablyazov gained control of B.T.A., the largest bank in Kazakhstan, in the early aughts by taking out billions of dollars in loans through shell companies and then refusing to pay them back, according to Adam Davidson’s meticulous report.** He first fled to London, where in 2009 a British court convicted him and sentenced him to prison. He then fled to France, where he is currently fighting extradition. While the British court ordered Ablyazov to repay $4 billion, the Kazakh authorities maintain that he stole $10 billion.\n\n>**Shortly after his conviction, Ablyazov became involved with the Trumps via Trump Organization executive Michael Cohen. The B.T.A.-controlled Silk Road Group negotiated with Cohen to license the Trump name for a tower in Batumi, a Georgian city on the Black Sea—an unusual move for a company based in Kazakhstan—and suggested that plans for a second tower in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi were underway, as well. The Silk Road Group, like other business Trump has partnered with to develop branded properties, was not primarily a real estate concern: It was a petrochemical shipping business.**\n\n>Ablyazov’s multi-billion-dollar theft is part of a vast money-laundering probe by Kazakh authorities, in which the Financial Times reported that Trump associate Felix Sater is cooperating. That probe also involves Ablyazov’s son-in-law, Ilyas Khrapunov, who is accused in U.S. lawsuits of laundering money by buying and quickly reselling American luxury condos, including three units in Trump-branded buildings, according to a recent article published by McClatchy.\n\n&nbsp;\n>One foreign deal, a stalled 2011 plan to build a Trump Tower in Batumi, a city on the Black Sea in the Republic of Georgia, has not received much journalistic attention. **But the deal, for which Trump was reportedly paid a million dollars, involved unorthodox financial practices that several experts described to me as “red flags” for bank fraud and money laundering; moreover, it intertwined his company with a Kazakh oligarch who has direct links to Russia’s President, Vladimir Putin. As a result, Putin and his security services have access to information that could put them in a position to blackmail Trump.** (Sekulow said that “the Georgia real-estate deal is something we would consider out of scope,” adding, “Georgia is not Russia.”)\n\n[No Questions Asked](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/08/21/trumps-business-of-corruption/amp) (8/14/17)\n\n>**A month after Trump visited Georgia,** he agreed to license his name to, and provide oversight of, a luxury hotel in Baku, Azerbaijan, a deal that I examined in an article in The New Yorker earlier this year. **Trump received several million dollars from the brother and the son of an Azerbaijani billionaire who was then the Minister of Transportation—a man who, U.S. officials believe, may have been simultaneously laundering money for the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. In 2013, Trump met with the Azerbaijani-Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov and his son, Emin; that November, they partnered with Trump on the Miss Universe contest, in Moscow, and discussed building a Trump Tower in the Russian capital. In June, 2016, at Emin Agalarov’s request, Trump, Jr., met with Natalia Veselnitskaya, a lawyer who has represented Russian intelligence. Trump, Jr., was promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Veselnitskaya came to the meeting accompanied by business associates who have extensive ties to Georgia and Azerbaijan.**\n\n[Donald Trump’s Worst Deal](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/13/donald-trumps-worst-deal) (3/13/17)\n\nFrom the Mueller Grand jury story:\n\n>They've combed through the list of shell companies and buyers of Trump-branded real estate properties and scrutinized the roster of tenants at Trump Tower reaching back more than a half-dozen years. **They've looked at the backgrounds of Russian business associates connected to Trump surrounding the 2013 Miss Universe pageant.**\n\nThis Article Continued:\n\n>Then there is Alexander Shnaider, one of the wealthiest men in Canada **who developed what used to be the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Toronto. Shnaider began accumulating his vast wealth in Ukraine shortly after the collapse of the USSR while working for his father-in-law, Boris Birshtein. Birshtein is an associate of notorious Russian mob boss Semion Mogilevich**\n\n>Shnaider’s fortune was planted in Ukrainian steel during the early 1990’s. The nation’s economy was collapsing, and it was still reeling from the 1986 nuclear catastrophe at the Chernobyl plant. ... One customer of choice was the Zaporizhstal steel mill, of which Shnaider bought a 93 percent ownership stake in 2001 for $70 million.\n\n\n>**Four years later, Shnaider was turning down offers for $1.2 billion for the same mill, and he was in the real estate business for the first time in his life: A deal to build the tallest building in Toronto with Trump.**\n\n&nbsp;\n>Like Ablyazov and Khrapunov, Tevfik Arif, who founded the frequent Trump partner Bayrock Group, hails from Kazakhstan. The origins of the elusive financier’s personal wealth can be partially deduced from a massive information dump to German newspaper Der Spiegel. Arif, who was once an economist for the USSR Ministry of Commerce and Trade\n\n>**Arif’s company, Bayrock, is among the most notorious examples of former Soviet bloc officials putting personal wealth acquired in the economic collapses across central Asia toward financing Trump hotels and condominiums. The Trump SoHo development, which was troubled almost from the start, was the subject of complaints from private investors who accused Bayrock of failing to disclose the fraud convictions of Arif’s partners, Felix Sater and Sal Lauria, to investors.** According to a New York Times article about the development’s legal woes, the project also took “financing from questionable sources in Russia and Kazakhstan.”\n\n>**The eccentricities of the building’s financial dealings came close to direct criminal investigation by the government, attracting scrutiny from the Manhattan district attorney. But when Trump settled with people who had purchased shares in his property, among the conditions of that settlement was that the investors cease cooperating with the government investigation.**\n\n[Trump Projects Used A Lot Of Dough Siphoned From The Former Soviet Bloc](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/trump-business-partners-soviet-cash)"

"If anyone is looking for the report where Felix Sater reportedly told people close to him he's resigned himself to going to jail with Donald Trump, [here it is](https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/08/forget-charlottesville-russia-is-still-the-true-trump-scandal/).  And it's by Paul Wood, who writes for the BBC and wrote first about the FISA warrants in January.  Specific paragraph in bold:\n\n> The National Enquirer presented Trump watchers with a mystery last week. Why did it print an attack on Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort? A headline screamed: ‘Trump advisor sex scandal — Paul Manafort’s sick affair.’ A 68-year-old man’s alleged dalliance with a ‘hottie half his age’ might seem a trivial subject to discuss as the US convulses over the issue of race once again, this time after a white supremacist killed a woman protester in Charlottesville, Virginia. President Trump has electrified supporters and opponents alike by siding with those who want to keep the town’s statue of the Confederate general, Robert E. Lee.\n\n> And sex, politics and celebrity are the Enquirer’s usual stock-in-trade. Recent ‘bombshell world exclusives’ include ‘Supreme court justice Scalia — murdered by a hooker’ (she was ‘hired by the CIA to inject poison into his buttocks’) and ‘Clinton sex romp caught on video!’about Bill being filmed ‘having steamy sex in a pickup truck with a department store clerk’.\n\n> But the Enquirer is a Trump ally, owned by a rich friend. It was one of the few national publications to predict his victory in last year’s presidential election. Why now a hit piece on the one man he must surely need to keep onside in the Russia investigation? One answer: Manafort has been ‘flipped’.\n\n> Reports in US publications say it was Manafort who told the FBI about a meeting between Trump’s eldest son, Donald Jr, and a Russian lawyer linked to the Kremlin. That would be terrible news for the President if true: the FBI’s investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia now being assisted by the manager of that campaign.\n\n> Manafort’s spokesman denies it, and the evidence as to whether he is trying to save his own skin at Trump’s expense remains ambiguous. The FBI carried out a dawn raid at Manafort’s home in Virginia; why was that necessary if he is a cooperating witness? Perhaps he has given up some information, but not all. The Enquirer story could be interpreted as a dead fish left on his doorstep (the traditional Sicilian warning that things could get very bad if you sing).\n\n> ‘If’, ‘could’, ‘perhaps’, ‘reports’, ‘alleged’ — most stories about the US President and Russia are nailed together with such words. The specifics of the ‘collusion’ allegation are claims that the Trump campaign told Russian intelligence which Democrats to hack, and then worked together with them to make sure that WikiLeaks, Fox, Breitbart and Russia Today all left the resulting dirty laundry flapping in the wind. In fairness to President Trump, it must be pointed out that so far no evidence has emerged to prove such a treasonous conspiracy. The few things we do know are open to wildly different interpretations.\n\n> Take Donald Jr’s meeting with the Russian lawyer. He admits its purpose was to get dirt on Hillary from the Russian government. This undid months of denials during which the White House often sounded like a shocked and offended maiden aunt accused of debauchery with the pool boy. (‘Trump denies sick affair with barechested Russian stud!) Other details of the meeting seem to help the White House. A jaunty, vulgar British PR man named Rob Goldstone was the unlikely intermediary. You might think that his help would hardly have been needed if there really were a backchannel to the Kremlin in June last year. On the other hand, such baroque arrangements might be the kind of thing that intelligence services go in for. For years, the intermediary between MI6 and the IRA was the owner of a Londonderry chip shop, Brendan Duddy.\n\n> It is the same with the intercepts of Trump’s people talking to the Russians, the subject of so much feverish speculation in Washington. There is no single conversation revealing a grand conspiracy — at least according to two members of the ‘intelligence community’ who have seen the top-secret material. However, a third source told me: ‘There is a conspiracy in the SIGINT [signals intelligence] — just not in one or two intercepts. Hence no literal “smoking gun”. But cumulatively…’ This SIGINT is mostly said to be what is termed ‘reflections’; that is others talking about the relationship between Team Trump and Moscow. Some of the calls are said to involve senior Kremlin officials: ‘By itself, not enough for indictments but a disturbing picture.’ Other sources have told me there have still been a suspiciously large number of direct contacts between Trump’s people and various Russians: ‘Dozens.’\n\n> A vague outline of the truth is starting to emerge from the fog. It is that the Russians made continual attempts to get close to Trump and his associates, part of what the US intelligence agencies all agree was a Kremlin plot to subvert the election. Trump’s supporters believe that any such approaches never went anywhere (as Jr says happened with his meeting) or that the tough New York property developer from The Apprentice was playing the Russians without being played himself. Trump’s enemies, believing him to be a man with no moral compass, imagine he was only too eager to take whatever was being offered: information; weird sex in a Moscow hotel room; money, lots of it, for his businesses.\n\n> This is why it is so important that the FBI investigation, led by a special counsel, Robert Mueller, now appears to be reaching back into Trump’s business past. Mueller’s team of prosecutors includes a number of experts in money-laundering and New York real estate. The US media is speculating that he is trying to build an old-fashioned wire fraud, tax evasion and racketeering case against Trump. This is a neuralgic issue for the President. In a New York Times interview he agreed that any investigation of his finances was a ‘red line’ Mueller should not cross. ‘I would say yeah. I would say yes. By the way, I would say, I don’t — I don’t — I mean, it’s possible there’s a condo or something, so, you know, I sell a lot of condo units, and somebody from Russia buys a condo, who knows?’ Trump’s most recent partner in ‘selling a lot of condos’ was a man called Felix Sater. Sater was once jailed for stabbing a man in the face with the broken stem of a martini glass. He was convicted of a massive stock fraud — a partnership between the Russian and Italian-American mafias — but stayed out of jail by becoming an FBI informant.\n\n> **For several weeks there have been rumours that Sater is ready to rat again, agreeing to help Mueller. ‘He has told family and friends he knows he and POTUS are going to prison,’ someone talking to Mueller’s investigators informed me. Sater himself added fuel to this fire when he told New York magazine: ‘In about the next 30 to 35 days, I will be the most colourful character you have ever talked about. Unfortunately, I can’t talk about it now, before it happens. And believe me, it ain’t anything as small as whether or not they’re gonna call me to the Senate committee.’**\n\n> Sater and Manafort together would pose a deadly threat to Trump’s presidency if they testify that Russian money in his businesses led to information being exchanged with Russian intelligence. This is exactly the relationship — an ‘exchange running between them for at least eight years’ — that the former MI6 officer Christopher Steele described in his ‘dossier’. At a news conference this week at his New Jersey golf club, the President bizarrely asserted that the Steele dossier had been paid for by Russia in order to damage him. This is the latest twist in Trump’s response to the dossier, which began with flat denials in January that he had been filmed by Russian intelligence with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel room.\n\n> That remains unproven. Nevertheless, Steele is not the only source. I heard of Russian kompromat — compromising material — on Trump from two sources months before the Steele dossier came to light. That might be evidence for Trump’s statement that Russian intelligence, as well as the US agencies, are out to get him. There are, though, reports of witnesses in the hotel who corroborate Steele’s reporting. These include an American who’s said to have seen a row with hotel security over whether the (alleged) hookers would be allowed up to Trump’s suite. The dossier’s account of hookers in a Moscow hotel room was the subject of gossip among a select group of journalists, politicians, and intelligence people for months before it was published. Now, claims are circulating of more tapes showing even more extreme behaviour. Expect these allegations to emerge in due course.\n\n> Some Republicans in Congress are tiring of the Trump reality show, a mix of The Sopranos and the Kardashians. The Mueller inquiry plods along relentlessly but prosecuting a president is a political decision. Reckless as ever, the President has tweeted criticism of the Senate’s Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, whose help he will need if Mueller finds anything damning. The President’s ordinary supporters don’t care. They fear that they are losing their country — this was an election above all about race; all else is trivia to them, an Enquirer headline.\n\n> Even if all the allegations are shown to be true, Trump will simply emerge as the person they supposed him to be when they voted for him.\n\n> [Spectator](https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/08/forget-charlottesville-russia-is-still-the-true-trump-scandal/)\n\n*edit: added full text because the site requires registration*"
'On its own, this story doesn’t mean much.\n\nBut it does mean that, every single time during the campaign that Trump claimed he had no business in Russia, he was knowingly lying. There is no way around that.\n\nWhich means we have to ask why.'
"> The new details from the emails, which are scheduled to be turned over to congressional investigators soon, also point to the likelihood of additional contacts between Russia-connected individuals and Trump associates during his presidential bid.\n\nhere we gooooooo\n\n> White House officials declined to comment for this report. Cohen, a longtime Trump aide who remains Trump’s personal attorney, and his lawyer have also declined to comment.\n\nand here's why donald is going extra bananas. investigators know everything and he knows it, and there's nothing left for him to do other than wait and go to town with his presidential powers before being proper fucked by the long dick of the law"
'I\'m not a Trump fan, but "the project was abandoned at the end of January 2016, just before the presidential primaries began, several people familiar with the proposal said." How is this incriminating? It shows him ending Russia relations before running for president.'
'This certainly adds to the pile of circumstantial evidence that Trump had a vested interest in pleasing Putin throughout the campaign. Still not enough of a smoking gun to make an airtight case, but I suspect Mueller will be looking into this aggressively, and it may lead to some answers.\n\nOf course, Trump will probably outright deny this deal was ever in the works, and his base will eat up his version of the story over, you know, professional journalism from verified sources.'

"Of course he did. This country is sick. Nothing will be done about this. Not for atleast another six months. God I hate this country. I don't care what people say, the fact that half of us belong to a political cult means we might as well already be dead as a nation."
'[Felix Sater is known to flip on people.](https://thinkprogress.org/https-thinkprogress-org-felix-sater-news-bad-for-trump-99e4ebe9a1ad/) He likes looking out for *numero uno* much like someone else.\n\n>Trump has repeatedly tried to distance himself from Sater, who served time in jail after assaulting a man with the stem of a broken margarita glass during a 1991 bar fight and then pleaded guilty in 1998 to his role in an organized- crime-linked stock fraud. **Sater’s sentencing was delayed for years while he cooperated with the federal government on a series of criminal and national security-related investigations, federal officials have said.**   '
"It's just shocking how bad they are at collusion and corruption, did they not think people would find out?"

'WaPo attributes this bombshell in part to "Trump Organization lawyers." WTF? Have they turned on him? Forced to confirm in the face of overwhelming evidence held by WaPO?'
'The true irony in all this is that THIS is the true globalist conspiracy that the right wing nutsos are always bleeding on about. Trump is pres. And all of a sudden klepto Russians are investing in his shit. Spreading the wealth and influence not through some governmental conspiracy but through transcontinental transfer of wealth. Fuck trump. Fuck the kleptocracy.   '
'I specifically remember during the campaign debates that he said I do not have any business dealings with the Russians. Not that I am surprised at another lie. \n\nSeriously, we need to have a recall ability for our elected officials. Especially when it is painfully obvious someone is attempting to seize control of power, and their party owns all aspects of government. The people need a TRUMP card. ~~Sorry for the pun~~ (Edit: Wasn\'t intended to be a pun), but when the people are saying enough is enough, and that government refuses to act, and the president has this insane ability to absolve his friends of crimes, we the people need to say, "ok, we\'re done, YOUR FIRED" for any federally elected official.\n\nThis needs to be a constitutional right because it is painfully obvious that corrupt, greedy officials will do whatever they can to horde everything for themselves. \n\nHow can we get this thing started? I can think of no better way to put an end to this. '
"There's no way he forgot or didn't think to mention this. He specifically stated he had no deals in Russia, no communication with Russians, no debt owed to Russia. He lied about something that I would consider a conflict of interests which could have impacts on America's foreign relations and national security. Nobody should be okay with this and the first people that need to stand up is the members of congress that have been letting Trump have a free pass so far."
'When the DNC organizes protests at them on a national level, there is no point. Just have people meet you at your office or send emails etc. You can call it cowardly, but frankly, it would be a waste of time. \n\nPlenty of evidence that this is neither grassroots, nor locally motivated. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6yuvnt/nearly_half_of_republicans_have_yet_to_hold_a/dmqm3tn/?st=j7c5xjcs&sh=cf81391c'
'So what? I guess OP conveniently forgot to watch all of the town hall videos where angry Democrats show up and scream at and berate Republicans like children. Liberal "activists" literally organize and bus people to Town Halls to hurl insults at Republican representatives.\n\nScreaming about ridiculous shit like little petulant man-children is a common tactic for those who really don\'t have a good argument, so it\'s not like this is a surprise for an entire political base that got fucked hard in November.  '
'Maybe something to do with the groups of protestors shouting them down, disrupting town halls and basically ruining any possibility of an actual civilized Q&A session with the general public?\n\nAlso the death threats. Also the actual attempted mass shooting of Republican congresspeople not long ago in DC by a radicalized leftist. '
"Yes, they're cowards, but also it shows that Trump is a weakness for them. Republicans aren't even trying to defend their President anymore. They never have, and they never will like him or see him as one of their own. Use that wedge, it's a major weakness. "
'Damn even my shitty representative (Bill Huizenga) has done a few town halls. '
"And then you've got the guys who only hold them between 10 and 3 so that working people with families can't make them at all, so they get to avoid the hard questions and just talk the people who are scared about muslims and Obamacare helping poor people. "
"Why would they? They'll get re-elected anyways. The great thing about lazy stupid voters is that they're reliably lazy and stupid. "
'The representative I\'m stuck with, Matt Gaetz, Republican, has held a few "Open Gaetz" days...but he\'s recently tailored his destinations to include places where he can avoid protestors and dissent. \n\nLast fall, one at a local bowling alley was packed out with angry people, pissed about his push to abolish the EPA, and the childlike stupidity with which he wrote that piece of legislation. He demanded abolishment of the EPA, while insisting that he supported the clean air and water acts. He refused to listen to his constituents, and routinely got booed to shut the fuck up when he\'d give his bullshit practiced answers. \n\nWhen the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico hit here, it cost everyone. It cost some people their livelihoods.  It\'s still a sore subject for a lot of us who live here...and yet Gaetz, being the idiot he is, decides to try to abolish the government department that makes it more difficult for companies to fuck up that badly by forcing them to follow environmentally sound guidelines. \n\nHaven\'t heard of him doing any other town halls as of this month. But I\'m looking forward to voting against his ass with extreme prejudice in 2018 and tossing him out back into civilian life. But I\'m sure he\'ll never understand, much less care, how poorly his idiotic tenure in office reflects on all of us in this area. '
"That's because you are not their target audience, the corporations are.  Republicans suck dick to corps, not you."
'Probably because it would turn into riots and violence from the left.'
'Well, it may have to do with the fact that people have been yelling, screaming, interrupting, and being flat out disrespectful. All across the country GOP representatives have been shouted down by some organizational movement; ruining the opportunity to have constructive conversations with our democratically elected representatives. \n\nLikewise, there has only been a few, if at all any, Democrat town halls interrupted by some GOP movement/protest. \n\nWant to know why there is a deep political divide in our country? Perhaps start with the actions of Democrats.\n\n'
'I\'m not saying the Dems are perfect. But they really have become complacent over the obama administration it seemed. It seems theyre trying to make the most of it to swing it back. I\'m Canadian and I\'m a little upset that the conservative party here is just making attack adds saying "Trudeau can\'t keep doing this it will ruin canada" yet it makes me lose respect as its one thing to shit on the other guy.

'In the past there were times I thought: \n\n“AndiFoxxx, your opinions of the right are overly critical and harsh.” \n\nThen after years of their bitching about Obama’s every move, trump became their candidate, and I thought, “No, they just proved you right.” \n\nThink about this, we elected our first black president a few years ago, and the right follow it up with this pussy grabbing asshat serial liar who built his campaign on *literally* building a wall to keep out all the Mexicans who want to steal from us, and banning all the Muslims who want to bomb us. This is fifth grade logic. He is quite possibly the most racist president since Andrew Jackson, and if there is anything I’ve learned about the right in the short time I’ve been on this earth, it’s that they are driven by fear-mongering tied to religious dogma. Too many of them are truly racist, homophobic, close-minded, conspiracy theory and fear driven, SCARED FRIGHTENED people and the movement itself needs to fucking DIE because it’s *poison* to humanity.

They're sorta stuck with what they sow. \n\nTrump and his pet can't even venture to Britain, our closest Ally and THEY'RE STILL IN THE WHITE HOUSE FOR CRYING OUT LOUD. Hell Pence's daughter went to my school in Boston he had to go IN DISGUISE to see his own damn daughter graduate. I don't think a presidential squad has every been so resoundly hated in history.

'The Bushes hate Trump because he is making transparent the bigotry, toxic power dynamics and economic exploitation that the Republican Party has always camouflaged so well as traditional values, trickle down bullshit and religious convention. I think it’s so sad that people are so deluded that they think these are decent human beings and would vote for them. They don’t give a shit about you. '

'why arent people telling bush to “shut up and go away” like they tell hillary. 👀\n\nim gonna sound a bit SJW, but I do believe it has to do with ingrained, subconscious sexism. I mean this country is over 200 years old and still no woman president. I’m not saying hillary should be president just cause she’s a woman, but it’s odd that despite the fact that women are about 50% of the population we as a nation have never elected a woman. '

"Bush is the reason I didn't vote for Romney or McCain. The NeoCon and NeoLiberal ideologies destroyed the middle class in American. Bush can go fuck himself. The only way the middle class has hope is if this country continues to reject those world views. \n\nBush was far worse from a policy standpoint than Trump. He accomplished a ton of shitty stuff. So far Trump has accomplished basically nothing other than a Supreme Court pick. "
'I still hate gwb jr for all the shit he did, and him hating trump does not improve of what I think of him. He still was one of the worst presidents before trump, and should be remembered as the 2 worst president '
"this is such a blow not just to Trump but to the entire current GOP racist fucks.  Senior George is as Reaganite a GOPer can get and he is basically telling them this GOP is so bad that GOPers from his era would rather vote for the Wife of Bill Clinton.  That's gotta hurt. "
'Man this shit bothers me so much. I like to sort by controversial to see how others might interpret the article and I shit you not, every post against it ( in this case Trump’s ‘anti-establishment’ mindset) will respond in outbursts until someone points out their view on the matter. Then this whole ‘prove it’ attitude forms. I only see those arguing against trump providing sources. The trump supporters just resort to yelling and go silent after anyone asked them to elaborate. It’s like they do it on purpose so then people can accuse them of being Russian trolls and meddle with everything. '

'Even shitty English politicians can show more basic decency than our shitty president'
'11 hours after Corbyn tweeted "My thoughts are with those killed and injured in #Charlottesville standing up to racism and hate." '
"I know Hitler invaded Europe, but there were egregious displays of violence on many sides, on many sides, so let's not blame anyone specifically. \n\nWouldn't be fair"
'not my quote, but i like it -\n\n"A Nazi kills a citizen in public in the United States in 2017.\nTheir president blames both sides.\nThis has to be some sort of alternative reality where hundreds of thousands of young Americans didn\'t die FIGHTING THE NAZIS."'
'I really wonder if this will hurt Trump with the Republican base, or do they not care at all about him refusing to condemn these white nationalists and their racism, and his refusal to comment on the mosque bombing as well. Bannon and Trump think the white Republican base will ignore his softness on the white nationalists.'
"He said violence from both sides and he's correct. But I guess leftist violence doesn't count. "
'And in the meantime, Theresa May fails to condemn islamic terrorists in her own country.'
"I don't think Trump knows what he is doing. He is a fucking traitor picking fights with all the allies and has Putin's dick in his ass."
"Didn't Trump have a conference right after this where he condemned hate of all forms, etc etc? "
"I think Americans can look at the Trump response to the mosque bombing and the terrorist that drove into protesters and see a pattern:  trump will not criticize violence if it's committed by white radicals.  Gorka basically said they will wait to see if it was liberals doing a false flag before considering denouncing an act of terrorism.\n\nThis is what you've come to.  The President playing racist politics with white nationalists while people are being murdered"
"This sub is really cancerous. He did condemn them and claiming he didn't is incredibly counter productive. You are pushing people farther right with this shit. The anti Trump subs clearly show that America deserved this idiot for a president"
"Trump's tweet:\n\n> We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!\n\nMay's tweet: \n\n> Our thoughts and prayers are with #Charlottesville. The UK stands with the US against racism, hatred and violence.\n\nWhat exactly did Theresa May do here that Trump didn't? She didn't reference specifically white supremacists or Nazis either. This headline is complete bullshit. "
'Neo-Nazis in the USA is literally the stupidest thing ever. Over 100,000 American soldiers died fighting against the Nazis during WWII. The Neo-Nazis are not American patriots! They are literally the opposite of American patriots.'
"Yeah, because it's the bare minimum a leader can do. Teresa May's a fucking incompetent malicious idiot and even she knows it's the done thing."
'I really dislike Trump.  I didn\'t vote for him.  I think he\'s a shitty president and an equally shitty human being.  I agree with the vast majority of those who are anti-Trump that it is quite literally dangerous to have him occupying the highest office possible.\n\nThat being said, this headline is bullshit.  How about \'Theresa May condemns \'racism\' of Charlottesville white supremacists after Donald Trump fails to denounce them *in the way that people wanted him to.*\n\nYes, the way in which he denounced the crazy ass white supremacists left a lot to be desired.  Yes, he clearly threw in a pot shot at leftists that, by and large, are nowhere near as violent as the douchebags that have been in Charlottesville.  But, no, he did not "fail to denounce them", period.\n\nFor everyone who is vehemently anti-Trump and outspoken about it, I don\'t blame you. But know this - headlines like this, and more specifically *defense* of headlines like this, are undermining your cause.  They give fuel, perhaps justifiably so, to those who believe the media is unfair to Trump.'
'what did obama do when blm was destroying cities, beating up civilians, and looting?'
'Whilst I congratulate her for being normal/human in this instance, May has always been on the ball when it comes to condemning acts of terrorism and/or senseless violence. The trouble is that\n in the next breath often comes rhetoric on the need for enhanced surveillance powers for the state.'
'Any one confused as if they should up vote these trump post so they get visibility or down vote them out of disgust '
'I thought Trump denounced the violence from both sides.'
"The President will not help in this matter. He's on their side. He doesn't want to make them angry at him."
"'Just remember we saved your ass in world war two!'\n\n'But we saved your ass in world war three!'"
"Theresa May shook hands with the DUP so her condemnation can fuck off as far as I'm concerned."

"Yeah, but a lot of people seem to forget that impeachment is a legal proceeding; you have to be able to prove that the president broke a law. It actually isn't simply a measure of unpopularity."
'Stop with these polls and talk about real politics, he will never be impeached unless he does something illegal. The russian story is dead, pegging arguably the most patriotic president we have had in a very long time as a nazi sympathizer is never going to stick, lets move on to real issues.'
'I would still vote for Trump over any democrat.  How fucked up is that?'
'I know it\'s cliche and someone\'s gonna be like "fake news", but I don\'t believe any of this shit anymore from either side. Especially on Reddit. Trump could spill the salt and you guys would start crying meanwhile Obama could kick a baby off a bridge and you guys would suck his dick all the way to the front page.'
"I don't care whether he's impeached or not, but he should be locked away in a jail for the criminally insane.  He certainly shouldn't be in control of nuclear weapons.  If anything comes of this, we need to make sure the launching of these weapons must be agreed upon by a qualified panel of people, not just at the whim of one person."
"For what? You can't just impeach someone because you are sad about losing an embarrassing long last impacting election or because he says unfiltered things. \n\nIt's looking more and more like 8 years. "
'and 70% cannot figure out what they want to eat for lunch and 90% cannot wake up in the middle of the night and get to the bathroom without kicking something or bumping into something.... these polls are annoying as hell and mostly biased one way or another. we really need a poll that is not biased in any way.'
"Stories like this are frustrating. They add to the noise without contributing any value to the signal. \n\nFirst of all, single polls are meaningless - you need an average over time to be predictive. So even if polls on this mattered (and they do not), one poll wouldn't. \n\nSecond: 40% isn't a majority. It isn't even the percent that voted for Hillary, much less the percent that voted for someone other than Trump. There probably wasn't a single moment in the Obama Presidency when you couldn't have found 40% of respondents willing to say yes to 'should President Obama be impeached for forcing Obamacare on the American people?' regardless of how accurate it was or was not.\n\nThird, as a matter of practical politics, no impeachment proceedings have ever been started by a congressional majority of the same party as the President. And there's certainly no reason to think Paul Ryan is the sort to buck that tradition. And even if he did, and even if he somehow magically got enough Republicans to vote in favor, Mitch McConnell is a worthless pile of cowardly steaming dog shit, who would either refuse to try the President or find a way to run the most worthless and biased trial ever, and nothing would come of it. \n\nFourth - and most importantly - *there's no evidence*. I loathe Mr. Trump. I opposed him from the time he announced his candidacy, I oppose him now. He is a horrible President, who is harming the country daily. But the Constitution says impeachment is for 'high crimes and misdemeanors'. If the Clinton impeachment is a farce that never should have happened, so would a Trump impeachment be now. Until and unless Bob Mueller returns back with actual evidence of collusion or other crimes, this is all pointless. \n\nSo it all comes down to this: for impeachment to be possible, Democrats would have to win majorities in both chambers come next year. Given the tactical situation of who is having to defend what in the Senate, their odds of doing that are far slimmer than Mr. Trump's were of winning last November. And even if they won, they wouldn't want to burn their new hard-won political capital making Mike Pence President, they'd want to stalemate Trump by sending him a stream of sensible legislation they know he'd veto, to help themselves out for 2020. It would be easier and more beneficial to them. \n\nTL;DR: unless it becomes crystal clear that he did commit crimes so serious that not even the Republicans can overlook it, Mr. Trump is never, ever being impeached. \n\n"
'40%? That low? How 60% of the country actually would not support impeachment of this maniac is unbelievable.'
'I wonder if this is the same people that gave us election day "poll" that said Trump would LOSE by 20 points, and people shouldn\'t even bother to come out and vote? \n\nNope, not believing the hype on this one.'
"Polls like this don't even concern me anymore. Frankly I'm just tired of reading them, because they don't mean anything, they never lead to anything. I've been reading about stuff like this for the past several months. People hate Trump, people want Trump gone, impeach Trump, etc etc. I don't like the guy either but I highly doubt anything is going to change. \n\n\nPerhaps I've spent too much time on Reddit. Every thread the same responses or criticisms about Trump are upvoted, anything from insulting his intelligence to insulting our country out of pure bitterness. I'm not defending the guy, but it is so tiring to keep reading. Perhaps I need to stay off Reddit for a while."
"I am no fan of Trump, but I feel like this is a horrible direction people are going. I am from Wisconsin, and I saw the same thing happen with Walker when they recalled him (which went horribly, he won again by even bigger margins)\n\nVoters here were mad he won and thought he was a shitty governor. Fair points, to be sure, but not a good reason for a recall. Trump, while being horrible, hasn't really done anything worthy of impeachment. Calling for impeachment of people with whom we disagree simply isn't a good idea."
'That low? Jesus shingle fucking tapping dancing christ America, get your shit together. '
'DISASTER president '
'I wonder what all this bullshit will do for voter turnout in the next election. My guess is people are all up in arms now, but will return to their complacent apathy when they have to put in the effort to put a piece of paper in a box.'

He\'s just a symptom.   Is is the fault of the Republican leadership?  They did purposely engineer their base to accept a populist thug who spouts comforting nationalist blather, but no.  We\'ve had decades of hateful GOP bigotry and hate to realize that they are garbage.\n\nIt\'s our fault.  The electorate (or slightly less than half of it) allow Trump to humiliate himself and our country like a drunk uncle with his pants down at a wedding reception.\n\nThe blame now falls squarely on those of you who think you\'re clever and savvy and cut-throat yet are just uninformed and hate-filled and ignorant.  **Those of you who voted for Trump.**  Those who still support that orange pustule are at fault.\n\nEvery day that you do not voice your dissent, you are culpable.  Every day you don\'t complain to your Republican leaders, you allow this to happen.

From a national security standpoint no administration would have a 100% true and honest medical report *shared with the public* especially if it would contain evidence that the leader of our country is weak, physically or mentally. These medical reports that are shared with the world will never say that the President is one meal away from a heart attack, one screaming argument away from a stroke, or that his brain is the consistency of gum that's been sitting in a hot car even if that's exactly the case.\n\nIMO just throw this in the pile with the other smaller lies that in themselves are terrible, but you can see the bigger shittier more criminal pile over here needs more attention."

'Here\'s what we know:\n\n* Trump is, by any medical definition, Morbidly Obese. That means his weight is dangerous to his health. He claims to be 6\'3" (he\'s not, he\'s 6\'2" at best if not shorter) and he admits to being 239 lbs. Even at 6\'3" that\'s Obese and 1lb away from being morbidly Obese, at 6\'2" and after eating a burger, he\'s morbidly Obese. Heart attack/stronke waiting to happen.\n\n* Has an LDL cholesterol level of 143, well above recommended 100 to be out of the danger zone, or twice that of the recommended guideline of below 70.\n\n* Trump has been a long term user of the drug Crestor, which lowers your cholesterol LDL levels by at least 30%, meaning Trump\'s actual LDL level was/is actually over 200. This would mean imminent heart attack risk in a morbidly obese 70 year old.\n\n* According to his doctor, Trump has nonclinical coronary atherosclerosis however this diagnosis does not match with the drugs or the fact that Trump’s coronary calcium score had increased to 133, from 34 in 2009. It is more likely he has clinical acute coronary atherosclerosis and is at high risk of cardiac arrest.\n\n* He takes Finasteride for hairloss. This affects your testosterone levels and in many cases libido and ED.\n\n*  He has genetic bone spurs, so bad apparently that he would not be a candidate for basic training. This was when he was in his physical prime 50 years ago, not morbidly obese with high cholesterol levels and heart disease.\n\n* Has never been drunk as he believes the Trump family are genetically incurable addicts.\n\n* Trump mainly eats McDonalds because he is terrified of being "poisoned" (oh the irony). \n\nIn other words, we have a POTUS that is turning 72, is morbidly obese, has extremely high cholesterol, a form of heart disease, bone spurs and is on at least two long term prescription drugs that both have side effect warning for heart conditions.\n\nWe are one twitter meltdown away from President Pence.\n\n'
'Cliff Notes:\n\n1. Steele Dossier played NO role in opening the Carter Page investigation. They began their investigation prior to even receiving it.\n\n2. The DOJ did in fact inform the court of the origin of the Steele Dossier.\n\n3. They accuse Nunes of deliberately misrepresenting the underlying FISA Warrant intelligence.\n\n4. Four different judge\'s approved FISA warrants including judge\'s appointed by Bush and Reagan. Multiple DOJ officials also approved the applications prior to the court even seeing them including Trump appointees Rosenstein and Boente.\n\n5. They actually started listening to Page after he left Trump campaign so the idea they were watching him to spy on Trump is absurd.\n\n6. Page has a long history with Russia going back to 2004 and was being actively investigated once before already in 2013. The FBI had even interviewed him in 2016 again prior to receiving the Steele Dossier. The Steele dossier was referenced in the application as corroboration of certain things, and not to independently demonstrate.\n\n7. A bunch of blacked out additional evidence with a bit in the middle noting Page lied to the HIC in his testimony in 2017 about meeting with Russian officials.\n\n8. It included the footnote that discusses the Steele dossier source which SPECIFICALLY STATES ..."The FBI speculates the the unidentified U.S. Person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1\'s campaign." Candidate 1 is Trump I believe, edit I previously thought Person 1 was Steele, this is the person coordinating with Steele. Steele is Source #1.\n\n9. DOJ timely informed the court when the FBI fired Steele and why.\n\n10. The attacks on Bruce Ohr for knowing Steele/and his wife working for Fusion GPS are 100% baseless. He was not involved in the FISA process and disclosed his relationships in November 2016.\n\nBasically Nunes and Gowdy lied whole cloth that the FISA warrant was primarily based on a news article and the Steele Dossier. Those were in fact the least used and most minor pieces of evidence and they picked them out specifically for that reason to discredit the investigation and lied about their use.'

Trump has released only to be consistently TRANSPARENT lol, she\'s a dick too.\n\nEDIT 6>>>HOLY SHIT...last one...THE DEMOCRATS MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTIONS, RATHER THAN WASTE TIME WITH POLITICAL JABS!!! you cannot make this up....wowowowowowo'
"Per the Washington Post:\n\n> But on Saturday, committee chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) accused Democrats of colluding with the government in a “cover up” of information as he announced the memo had been posted online\n\n> “We actually wanted this out,” Nunes told an audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference. “It’s clear evidence that the Democrats are not only covering this up, but they’re also colluding with parts of the government to cover this up.”\n\nI am so fucking sick of this asshole's bullshit."
'Today is a bad day for conservative bullshit narratives built on lies...'
"I actually read the damn thing, because I have a hot Saturday as always.\n\nIt's excruciatingly precise in its rebuttals. \n\nTL; DR: Republicans have been lying through their teeth."
'From https://twitter.com/ScottMStedman/status/967519076338642945\n\nAdam Schiff says that the DOJ has corroborated the Carter Page section of the Steele dossier. What does that section claim?\n\n1 Page had a secret meeting with Igor Sechin - Rosneft Prez\n\n2 Sechin offered brokerage of Rosneft sale to Trump team\n\n3 Page had a secret meeting with Divyekin.\n\n4 Divyekin told Page that the Kremlin had incriminating info on Clinton.\n\n5 Divyekin hinted to Page that the Kremlin had kompromat on Trump.\n\nIf confirmed, this is one of, if not the most significant day in the Trump/Russia story.\n\nEdit: I am bad at formatting.'
'Nunes is a traitor, intentionally lying to undermine an investigation into other traitors.\n\nHistory will remember him for the snake that he is.'
"The russians told the trump campaign, **on three seperate occasions**, that they had Hillary Clinton's emails/dirt. The trump campaign never informed the FBI about that, they called it a hoax. They are guilty! They colluded by the simple nature of denying that Russia was interfering at all. They KNEW were those emails came from and called it a hoax becuase of course it helps them. They knew Russians were helping them and then they lied about all the meetings. There is no way Trump is innocent here. No fucking way. "
"Sarah Sanders just released a BS statement about the memo being nonsense and not that Hillary funded the Dossier so the FISA court shouldn't have accepted it.\n\nIs there any hope Sarah Sanders ends up indicted at some point?  She's such a vile piece of trash."
"It's ludicrous and sad that this memo even has to exist. The now-established fact that Russia interfered with our election, the ~~19~~ 22 indictments, 5 guilty pleas, and the mountain of ever-growing evidence makes this all totally moot, IMO. It's incredibly transparent what's going on when Republicans completely ignore the gravity of the substance of these charges and allegations, and instead focus on the way in which these things were discovered. It's a shameful fucking travesty."
'So the FISA warrants were granted by 4 federal judges, 2 of them being Bush/Reagan appointees... but it’s still a liberal conspiracy amirite? '
'Nunes....... He apparently just said that the Democratic Memo doesn’t change anything and that it somehow proves intel abuse occurred.\n\nOk, if it proves intel abuse occured, then why didn’t you add the stuff that proves it to your memo, you **dumb California Farmer inbred criminal fuck.**.  (Fucking Shitheads the politicians who defend Trump are)'
"The same people who think the FBI was wrong to use the Steele dossier (even though it's not what prompted the investigation), are the ones complaining that the FBI didn't take the tips about the Florida shooting seriously. Which one is it? Is the FBI supposed to seriously consider tips or aren't they? The levels of hypocrisy are mind-blowing.  "
"Twitter fingers went from 'Russia involvement is fake news' to 'Russians were involved, why didn't Obama do anything!!!!'"
'How fucked up is it that 5 members of Trump’s campaign were under FBI investigation by Sept ‘16. FIVE! Yet somehow that stayed completely secret while Hilary’s email investigation kept getting leaked by the FBI every week. \n\nThat shit is unreal. '
'Doesn’t matter. The other memo served its purpose. It’s not like we needed the Dem one to know it was bullshit. '
'Holy shit Trumps tweets about this release might be as dumb as Nunes’ original memo'
"Combover Caligula clearly seems to be triggered by this thing. 5 tweets about the Schiff memo alone, with plenty of additional distraction. \n\nHe can keep spinning furiously all he wants. Ultimately, the memo speaks for itself. \n\nRight off the bat, you can see how much more coherent and thoroughly documented it is compared to Nunes' tinfoil. It's fairly devastating that the bulk of the Schiff memo merely supplies the context and facts that Nunes selectively omitted—and that this is enough to demolish Nunes' various misleading claims. \n\nVery much looking forward to when Mueller sets forth the full story on the public record."
"Lets look at both sides: \n\nGOP: FISA, DOJ, and FBI are in the wrong because they spied on someone.\n\nDems: Members of the GOP colluded with a foreign country during the election.\n\nNo matter how much the GOP tries to distract, just realize that they have no arguments for their side. This memo shows us that the FISA warrant was warranted. This also shows us that we really need to worry about who else in the GOP is connected to Page and Manafort and the crew because there are already some serious allegations stacking up.\n\nThis investigation is going perfectly if you think about it. Mueller has already identified people and entities with money laundering and conspiracy against the USA. Those are some serious charges and the GOP is not fighting back against those charges (if they are, its piss-poor arguments). Take heart. This shows us that we are on the winning side of this one. I think justice is finally going to be brought to everyone involved (assuming Trump doesn't begin to pardon people).\n\nBeware of anymore distractions from the GOP, Trump is going to have a hissy fit and the GOP will make up some story about how Hillary is actually Hitler. Don't give them the clicks or the views."
'As usual, republicans are lying, democrats are engaging in a futile effort to call them out on it, and trump supporters continue to cry fake news.\n\nMueller. Hurry. Up. *please*'
'Hannity on suicide watch right now.'
'Republican talking points are making me dizzy. They were mad about reckless unmasking, but now they’re angry because Clinton and Trump’s names weren’t recklessly unmasked.  \n  \nTheir entire case rests on the idea that multiple Republican-appointed judges, each with over a decade on the bench, couldn’t grasp the political aspects of the situation because—in fall 2016—Clinton and Trump’s names were replaced with “Candidate 1” and “Candidate 2” '

'So instead of addressing the presidents cyber bullying you request everyone to ignore it. '
'She got bullied in person about speaking out about cyberbullying. WTF'
'This is all really unfortunate.  Cyber bullying is a serious issue and a good one for a first lady to make as her cause.

"I always figured that she picked cyber bullying as her cause because she knew it would be a sign that she was a closeted rebel. \n\nIt's not like she hasn't noticed that Trump is a cyber bully. Trump is a bully at heart. He has a well documented history of such behavior regardless of how it's displayed."

'It’s all a big joke. Really she is fighting bullying really, how? Holding meetings, admitting her husband is problem. Tell us something we didn’t know. Ok, what action is she taking.  He is no different than the day she met him. May be worst.  If anything bullying has intensified and growing. No line trump won’t cross.  Disgusting.'
"i actually think it'll be a very sad day in history when cyber bullying is truly regulated"
'No shit. She should have NEVER started the issue seeing how her husband treats individuals.'
'Of course there is some bullying against Trump supporters, but Trump practically centered his campaign around bullying people, and taking people "....out on a stretcher." '

'Why the FUCK is she leading any delegation? Was she elected? What are her qualifications outside of "Trump is my last name?"'
"I don't know ivanka trump. But no one elected her. What she is doing leading a foreign delagation is beyond me. People really screwed the pooch when they thought negotiating a business deal is the same as politics. In my limited experience, deal making in business can often consist of who the bigger jerk is. Whose willing to play hardball. \n\nBut in foreign policy, it often behooves a person to do the opposite. You want as many friends or non enemies as possible. It's exactly the opposite of business. \n\nShe has almost as many qualifications as I do to be in this position. Hell, I have a degree in history. I bet I know enough about other countries that I would atleast be respectable. And if not as a historian I know how to get that info. It makes me so, so mad that the world is built in such a way that people like this are the winners. And I can't pay my mortgage."
"This is time for your daily reminder that Ivanka having a government position with no qualifications violates anti-nepotism laws.  Not to mention breaking the emoluments clause and anti-corruption laws in handling Trump's finances."
"This is the bullshit of Trump... we've been barraged with so much bullshit and scandal and upset that we're not even able to dedicate enough time to get truly upset about this sort of shit. Ivanka has no place leading a delegation or acting as an adviser. This is bullshit and needs to stop. \n\n\nFor a party that seems to glorify the founding fathers in a deistic way, the GOP sure is fine ignoring the monarchial tendencies of Trump. The founding fathers would have grabbed their muskets and shot Trump in their time (the actual fucking reason for the 2nd amendment). \n\n**THIS IS NOT OKAY. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.**"

"Dunning Kruger in full effect here.  Ivanka is entirely too dumb to realize that she's entirely too dumb to be put in these positions.  \n\nJust like her dad is entirely too dumb to realize that he is entirely too dumb to be in the position he's in.  \n\nGod what a surreal world its become."

'Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, commonly called "Caligula" or "Little Boots," was Emperor of Rome from 18 March AD 37 – 24 January AD 41.  He had a favorite horse, named Incitatus.  The historian Suetonius claimed that at one point Caligula wished to name his horse Consul.\n\nThe reasons given for naming a horse as consul was because he was insane.\n\nLater historians have claimed that the "horse as consul" story was made up, just to make Caligula, who did other bad things, look worse to posterity.\n\nBut there are also some historians that see a method in Caligula\'s madness.  He didn\'t name his horse to the consulship because he was crazy, he named his horse to the consulship because the position of consul was so unimportant to Caligula, that even a horse could do it.\n\nI don\'t know if the story is true, or apocryphal, or if it has a deeper meaning.  But I can see some obvious parallels with what is happening now.\n\nIvanka taking her father\'s seat for a period during G20 discussions in Hamburg, and heading the country\'s delegation at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in November, smacks of Donald Trump not caring about those appointments enough to name someone capable to the positions, or, as he is expected, of doing it himself.\n\nIn this scenario, Ivanka Trump is the horse, and Donald Trump is Caligula.\n\nThings didn\'t end well for Caligula or his family.'

'I fucking hate Donald Trump. '
"Shark fin soup yesterday, and now elephant trophy hunting.  I wonder what it's like to be ethically wrong on every policy idea and still fall up because you've got the unwavering support of the coveted mouth breather, rapist and illiterate demographic who grew tired of honey boo-boo?  "
'Trump supporters be like "WTF I hate animals now!"'
'In case we forgot that Eric and Don Jr killed an elephant.'
'Is this actually bad. If someone pays silt money to legally shoot an elephant, an old or sick one and the money is the used to help protect the other elephants, does this not benefit the species? '
'This does nothing to enrich America, it is only hurtful, only soulless. This is one of the most revealing moves he has ever made politically. Donald Trump is heartless, hideous, and inhumane.'
'What the FUCK\n\nI’ve been outraged, literally, every fucking week of this presidency but I will fill on rebel against this shit. They’re not on our continent. They’re fucking endangered. DO NOT FUCK WITH THEM\n\nFFS DOES EVIL KNOW NO BOUNDS'
"So hunting in places like Africa gets a bad rep because of trophy hunting, in fact all hunting gets a bad rep because of trophy hunting. \n\nHunting animals so you can bring home an elephants tail or the head to stuff and mount on your wall is disgusting. \n\nBut hunting in Africa is actually very beneficial. I am usually elephants as an example specifically here because I've see a terrible picture of don jr next to a dead elephant holding its tail. The elephants people are allowed to hunt are usually problem elephants. They don't just take you out into the Serengeti and let you pop shots off at elephants or endanger species. The elephants you're allowed to hunt are also to old to mate, and they will chase off younger males trying to mate thus hurting the population. They are also elephants that destroy villages or farms and cause general problems for the community. If hunters don't kill them then the locals will be forced to. Difference is when a hunter goes to hunt an elephant, that money goes directly to supporting the wildlife reserve. It's used to help protect the animals that aren't allowed to be hunted. It goes to finding anti poaching organizations and pays to keep the park staffed. The meat goes to feed poor villagers. \n\nOnly fucking sickos like don jr take it a step further and mutilate the animal as some sort of prize. Hunting is about having respect for what you kill, trophy hunting is about just wanting to kill something for the sake of killing.  "

I suppose I shouldn't expect anything less from the party that's trying to undermine/destroy the endangered species act and every environmental regulation in their path, and authorising the killing of bear and wolf cubs while they sleep.

He believes that the rules were not meant for him but rather the rest of us.  I am not making any assumptions here but rather noting his past comments and history.  This is important to be aware of when analyzing how he handled Comey.\n\nHis sit down with Comey was business as usual for an Aristocrat.

">“I certainly view this as a violation of the emoluments clause, yes. And many others as well, both foreign, in terms of the business effort to expand the Trump Organization,” Schiff told CNN’s “New Day,” referring to a constitutional clause that bars the president from accepting payments or gifts from foreign governments without congressional consent.  \n>  \n>“But, also domestically\xa0— and this may not be constitutional violation, but it's certainly an ethical violation\xa0— by the constant milking of the federal government when the president requires the federal government to patronize Trump\\-related businesses.”\n\nHmmm, no where in the article did I see / read statements suggesting a next course of action by any of the names dropped in the article.\n\nNot only am I beyond tired of the shady shit trump pulls but I also getting tired of all the people from the other side calling him out but that's it. If someone calls bullshit then find a way to make it stop."
'ITT people arguing that democrats are to blame for this.  Wtf?'
"I bet Trump doesn't even realize that there's something wrong with what he's doing. Which is it this time, ignorance or malice?  Ignorance or malice?  It's just so hard to tell with the right nowadays.  "
"He's just screaming into an echo chamber at this point. Until there are NEW voices from congress calling out Trump on his shit, it's not going to change. All these statements and articles are doing is making us numb to this shit. "
'This is criminality. Blatant, unvarnished, and actionable. Now we find out if our government is one that will choose rule of law or whatever hell comes rushing forth without rule of law.'
'I keep seeing things about stuff Trump is doing violating the emoluments clause but here’s the thing, as long as he can hide behind the whole blind trust argument or the “fact” that he handed the Day-to-Day operations over to his kids doesn’t that cover him? He’s not receiving benefits his blind trust is. \n\nAlso this comment is more of a mind exercise for me since in reality we all know the Republican Congress is never going to actually call him on any violation of the constitution or his oath of office.

'No shit. And so is everything that goes on at Mar-a-Lago.'

"Well we *did* burn Toronto (then York) to the ground... Call me nuts, but I'm going out on a limb to say that fighting British Naval impressment probably didn't require that.  \n\nEDIT - Also, the burning of the White House was one of England's biggest strategic blunders in the War of 1812... They assumed it would demoralize the US and lead to automatic surrender.  Instead we galvanized, then slaughtered them back to the Atlantic coast and forced the Treaty of Ghent."
"First of all, as a Canadian, we frequently brag about this being us, since they were our ancestors technically. But I can't believe he used it as a jusitification for tariffs.

That Trump supporters can't see how he's doing potentially irreversible damage to the world is shocking. Well, not as shocking now, I've become bitter and resentful."

'Washington was burned in response to Americans burning towns in Canada.

Prévost argued that,\n\n> … in consequence of the late disgraceful conduct of the American troops in the wanton destruction of private property on the north shores of Lake Erie, in order that if the war with the United States continues you may, should you judge it advisable, assist in inflicting that measure of retaliation which shall deter the enemy from a repetition of similar outrages.[8]\n\n> On July 18, Cochrane ordered Cockburn to "deter the enemy from a repetition of similar outrages....

'Oh FFS reddit. Up until Trump made this quote, reddit has said for years that it was Canada.

The cells here are built for 36 inmates to be held up to three days, before being released or transferred to a larger prison facility. But thanks to a profound crisis in Venezuela’s judicial system, it now holds over 150 prisoners, some who have been here for months or years. The number grows daily as more Venezuelans are arrested for crimes, including mugging, kidnapping and murder. In the most crowded cell, prisoners have no room to even sit down, and take turns resting on sheets tied to bars like hammocks.\n\nThey don't seem super similar. \n\n"

'This Democracy Now! interview from May 2017 continues to be relevant\n\n>**RUTH** **BEN-GHIAT:** Yes. So, I’m pushed many times in the media to label Trump a fascist. And I’ve never done that, because Trump is not aiming to establish a one-party state. It’s too much work, I imagine, and he doesn’t need to. The thing about authoritarians today—and we can look at what’s happening in Turkey and elsewhere, and even in Russia—you don’t need to have a dictatorship in the classic sense to accomplish your goals. You can intimidate people. You can try and control the press. You can attack the judiciary, the media, the institutions, hollowing them out, without having to ban parties in the traditional fascist manner.  \n>  \n>That said, there are many similarities. One of them I mentioned before. **There’s this testing period constantly that the authoritarian is doing to see how much he can get away with. What is the appetite of the political elites and the public for violence? And this goes back to Trump’s comment—right?—that he could shoot someone. This is quite extraordinary.** And Mussolini did the same thing, as did Hitler. And the other element is that people don’t take these people seriously until it’s too late. So, I’ve been trying to warn the public, along with many other people, about the dangers, including this article you mentioned most recently, the dangers that these men bring with them. And by the time people realize, it’s too late.\n\n\\--  Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University (bold mine)\n\n[linky](https://www.democracynow.org/2017/5/11/historian_of_fascism_why_trump_firing)'

"The entire party is complicit with this. They have been fomenting this shit for the last ~~30yrs~~ 50yrs. It's only going to get worse from here.  "
'Notice how, when Bossert was pressed, he *individually* condemned white supremacy, careful not to ascribe the condemnation to Trump. \n\n> "**I** condemn white supremacists and racists and white Nazi groups and all the other groups that espouse this kind of hatred," Bossert said'
"You can't run on a campaign of thinly veiled white nationalism and overt racism, then pretend to distance yourself from a bunch of violent racists and nazis. It's not just Trump who is complicit in this, though. The Republican party feigned offense at Trump's words then fell the fuck in line with him. Moreover, it's the responsibility of the Electoral College to prevent pieces of shit like Trump from getting the presidency by appealing to bigotry and they failed miserably. Trump, and the terrorist attack in Charlottesville, aren't isolated incidences. They are examples of a systemic problem that the US is going to have to work hard to weed out."
'The last thing that Mayor Signer said in that interview really struck me:\n\n> He\'s [Donald] already on the sidelines of so many issues.\n\n> The country will move forward.\n\nThis has become a trend in the Trump presidency: "The US moves forward without him."\n\nAlmost all of the world\'s nations signed on to the Paris Climate Agreement in an effort to do *something* about climate change, but Donald pulled the country out of it.  No matter.  State officials, city officials, and private citizens know that climate change isn\'t a Chinese hoax and are doing what we can to move forward without him.\n\nOur intelligence communities have said that the Russian government is an enemy of western democracy, our allies have said the same, and top officials say that Russia needed to be punished for it.  Donald just shrugged and continues to act submissive towards Putin.  So lawmakers moved on without him and enacted sanctions against Russia that he couldn\'t veto without looking weaker than he already does.\n\nNow, Republicans and Democrats both agree that what happened this weekend is domestic ~~violence~~ terrorism perpetrated by white supremacists.  The Charlottesville mayor hopes that this one issue can unite the nation. Yet Donald, once again, acted weak during a time when we needed strong leadership.  So we\'ll move on without him.\n\nWhat a shit leader.  He isn\'t at the head of any movement.  He\'s on the sidelines angrily, impotently tweeting while the rest of the country and the rest of the world moves on without him.'
'Are all Trump supporters racist? No, but I bet every one of those inbred racist fucks down there voted for Trump. '
"Most people didn't know how truly racist America is until Trump came into office. I guess the silver lining is we are exposing our true colors. "
"Yep. But he doesn't care because he's busy on vacation and figuring out a way to blame Obama and Hillary for it."
'Anyone who followed the political shitshow for the last year knew Trump in power would eventually result in people getting killed. This is probably only a start. When Mueller gets close and the D.C. will be in the process of getting rid of this clown car of a government, things can get potentially very very ugly if these traitors choose to "activate" their base.\n\n\n^^edit: ^^grammar '
'Finally a politician calling shit how it is. Trump is a racist piece of shit.'
'North Korea do their usual bullshit: Trump: FIRE AND FURY! BLOOD AND DESTRUCTION! LOCK AND LOAD! GEESE FOR THE GOOSE THRONE!\n\nNeo Nazis terror attack murder people in VA: Trump: hey guys calm down lol'
'This whole thing is terrifying.  Trump is like Hitler meets Charles Manson.  Pretty sure neither of them personally killed anyone, but they both spewed rhetoric and hate speech with the intent to start a race war and got "their people" to do the dirty work.'
'Unfortunately I am one of the people who voted for him. Yes I said unfortunately. I was raised in a right wing home. My entire life I thought that what my parents were saying was the right thing because they are my parents right? It was the first time I could vote for president and I hopped on the same train as many more people did. But then I started to realize he hasn\'t done anything he promised but still says he has. This so called "fake news" is just the stuff he doesn\'t want to hear. I promised myself I will no longer stand for what he stands for. I will not sit by and watch more people be mowed down by nazis. Watching the video of those monsters marching onto the Virginia university campus with there torches sent a chill up my spine and I was almost sick to my stomach. That\'s what Donald Trump stands for, that\'s what my family stands for. '
"Nazis were beaten before and they will be beaten again. People will start to wake up and realize the shit that's going down and start to fight it, and the neonazis will be humiliated. How could these idiots have learned so little from history?"

It gets harder every time."
'"I condemn white supremacists and racists and white Nazi groups and all the other groups that espouse this kind of hatred," the mayor said.\n\nis what trump should have said. immediately, emphatically  and repeatedly.   the fact that he did not tells us a great deal about trump.'

'Charlottesville was not an isolated act of fascist Terrorism.\n\nIn June 2015, Dylann Roof was inspired by the “hate facts” posted on Daily Stormer and Council of Conservative Citizens to murder nine people at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nIn July 2015, John Russell Houser, a far-right former bar owner, shot and killed two people and injured nine others before committing suicide in a Lafayette, LA movie theater which was playing Trainwreck, due to its feminist themes and characters, as well as its lead actor\'s Jewish background. Houser was said to have been a misogynist and praised the actions of Adolf Hitler on online message boards.\n\nIn November of 2015, a group of well-armed 4chan regulars attended a Black Lives Matter camp in Minneapolis, harassing them with racial slurs. They opened fire on activists attempting to chase them out when they returned a second night, wounding five.\n\nAn antifascist protester of Milo Yiannopolous was shot in stomach on Inauguration Day by Elizabeth Hakoana, who came to the protest with her husband, who planned to “crack skulls” of the “snowflakes” at the event and provoke a reaction to justify shooting someone.\n\nLater in January, Alexandre Bisonette, a supporter of Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen, opened fire on a Quebec City Islamic Culutral Center, killing six.\n\nIn February, a white U.S. Navy veteran, Adam Purinton, 51, killed an Indian engineer, wounded his Indian co-worker, and shot a man who tried to stop the murder at a bar in Olathe, KS while yelling "get out of my country."\n\nIn March, James Jackson, a subscriber of Alt Right Youtube channels, traveled from Baltimore to New York with the sole purpose of murdering a black person at random.

'There is no justification for any violent attack, but there is a reason.\n\nI\'m not defending what anyone has done, but if we look at why these people feel the way they do instead of calling them names and berating them, maybe we could find a lasting solution to a long standing problem instead of just smearing more shit everywhere. \n\nEveryone\'s comparing these people to Nazis, or straight up calling them that. What allowed Hitler to rise to power? Did an entire country get together and say "we\'re all racist pieces of shit" and collectively murder everyone? Or was it the repercussions of WWI, a feeling of hopelessness, a hyperinflated currency, lack of employment, and just general frustration? Those things made the population susceptible to the propaganda of the truly evil, racist mother fuckers.\n\nIt\'s a lot easier to hate someone than it is to try to find an explanation for their actions. Don\'t do the easy thing, actually think about it. And this goes for everyone, not just one side or the other. Take the time to think about why they feel the way they do.'

"The way I see it there's two explanations for all of this.\n\nEither Trump spent his entire career to trying to take down a liberal conspiracy (A conspiracy that has apparently operated in he shadows for decades despite having compromised all three branches of the federal government.) But is so inept that he placed agents of this conspiracy in positions of power.\n\nOr he's a liar who's desperately trying to discredit an investigation against him.\n\n"
"Kind of stupid for Trump to be making claims that this was an attack on America when it was a Republican appointed Republican prosecutor giving the information to the Trump appointed Republican Deputy AG who then got authorization from a Trump appointed Republican judge who authorized another Trump appointed Republican AG in NY to carry on with the investigation and raid.\n\nIt's all your own guys Donnie, every one of them is either one of your appointments or appointed by one of your appointments, and every single one of them is a Republican, not a single rogue Dem in the mix."
"The response from Trump shows John Bolton is right next to him - we all know what that guy's advice is: attack Iran, attack North Korea, attack someone else... For millions of people to lose their lives off of this is absolutely disgraceful, and on us who are watching this go down in full view without acting to stop it. "
"Hmmm... If he is not guilty why is he panicking? For all we know Cohen did something illegal and that's why he is in trouble. He is screaming attorney client privilege because his attorney is doing some illegal shits on behalf of him, the client."

Trump\'s business is so crooked it makes cronies flip on the boss.\n\nIt makes all but the most incompetent hatchet men say, "Oh hell no, I don\'t want to be anywhere near this when it explodes."'

They’ve all but cleared them of colluding with Russia as it slowly trickles all that Mueller wants to question him on is Comey and Flynn. Which is flimsy and likely to not be anything able to be pursued as Trump can fire anyone in a nominated office he chooses...and people act like comey was investigating alone, it didn’t stop the investigation at all...and the facts are still essentially what Comey told him: he’s not under investigation for collusion. \n\nThe day he proposes sweeping historic immigration reform, putting on the table citizenship for 1.8M people. 1,800,000 people. Three times the population of Vermont...and then this comes out to distract people from what he’s trying to accomplish again. I am no fan of the person trump is, but I am sickened by the media using allegations of discussions months ago to take people’s eyes off the fact that progress is being made...president racist wants to give citizenship to 1,800,000 people that the left will have you believe he despises. \n\n/end rant.

"If Mueller is fired it means the president believes the presidency is above the law. If we don't act, it means we don't care enough to disagree. \n\nThese protests must be inclusive. Leave your pet issues at home. Leave your important issues at home. There is one issue- equal justice under the law. There is one demand. Resign or Be Removed. "
'Because yes, he really is that stupid. \n\nAnd arrogant. And ignorant of how the real world actually works beyond signing a check. \n\nWho knew living could be so complicated?'
'It doesn’t matter because nothing matters anymore. He really could shoot somebody on 5th Ave and Republicans wouldn’t do a damned thing. '
'What I’m wondering is, considering how silent / complicit the GOP has been over the insane list of things Trump has done; Mueller has likely dug up nasty shit on them as well. \n\nWhile the scope of investigation has been Trump & the election; if the disease is far deeper, how would he handle that? How far down the chain would they go, because that kind of vacuum causes real issues too. Mind boggling to consider '
'Trump will continue to attempt to fire Mueller until either it works, or  Mueller gets Trump fired instead.'
'2017: What if Trump tries to fire Mueller? \n2018: What if Trump tries to fire Mueller, again?'

'[New tweet from Donnie Moscow](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/984371491277099010):\n\n> If I wanted to fire Robert Mueller in December, as reported by the Failing New York Times, I would have fired him. Just more Fake News from a biased newspaper\n\n'
"To bad they didn't foresee a whole party willing to throw away the constitution to enrich themselves and the companies, wealthy individuals donating to them.\n\nAt some point the US needs to move past the whole 200 years ago some people foresaw and put in place restrictions. blah blah blah.\n\nWhat is required is an overhaul of the system. Move away from a two party governship. Move away from an system that allows states with 10x less people have equal or more representation. Move away from constitutional rights that need to be replaced if not removed as they have no merit in the current world. Perhaps even move away from a presidency that allows so much control without opposition and a presidency where they run based on party rather as individuals without party affiliation.\n\nAt this point, i think the only way the rest of the world will be willing to take the US seriously again, is going to require a lot of changes to the US system. As the US has proven that it cannot be trusted to even elect a sane president, but they cannot be trusted to uphold and sustain partnerships and treaties and deals beyond the term limits of the present presidents political party."
'LOW IQ Forefathers treating me very unfairly in the constitution!!!! WITCH HUNT!!!'
"There is a Russian, Chinese war on the US, instead of attacking our people, they're exploiting holes and flaws in our form of government. What we need now is a severe patching of the hull of our form of government. Removing outlandish sources of gobs of money, and more."
'"they planned for you", and their plan failed miserably \n'
'Every time I see Trump, or a story about him with his picture I just am still in shock that he’s president. The man’s face looks it’s decaying from trying and failing, to hold all the evil inside the human shaped meat sack.  \n\nEven if you agreed with all of his abhorrent policies, I still can’t believe people looked at him and went “This is most certainly a well put together and healthy individual! He most certainly does not look like the human equivalent of a Hellmouth!”'
'They warned us and put mechanisms in place but we have to rely on people to activate them. The first line of defense was the fucking electoral college which utterly failed. '
"I'm sorry but as long as it's 'former' this or 'former' that, it doesn't really bloody matter. He doesn't listen to anyone but he's sure as hell not gonna listen to a 'former' something.\n\nUntil someone currently in a position of power tells him to shut the fuck up then chances are he's going to go on his stupid impulses and fire Mueller.\n\nOf course, then the sealed indictments come into play, along with state charges in NY and hopefully it causes enough disruption that congress reinstates Mueller to carry on because Trump will have proven he's guilty as sin.\n\nI mean, he's guilty as sin so he's trying to save his own skin but the truth always comes out eventually. Especially you're as monumentally stupid as Trump is."
"Trump is legendarily stupid.  He fired Comey and everything went from a 5 to a 10.  He is still too stupid to put together the correlation there, that firing Comey directly led to the appointment of Mueller.\n\nHe WILL fire Mueller at some point, or publicly try to.  And it will take it from a 10 to a 50.  He's just too fucking stupid to understand."
'For all the people suggesting our forefathers failed:\n\nThe correction comes from our vote. The one true power we have over our elected officials, and is a right our forefathers fought and died for. We begin this correction in November and is how America works. If Donald does nothing more than inspire better people to get into politics, and win, then we will be stronger in the end. \n\nAlso, generational polling is the worst it has been in polling ***history*** for the GOP. Their future is bleak as hell and GOP leadership knows this. '
"Our forefathers might have plan for somebody like Trump, but the citizenry at-large is still continuing to fail from removing him from office.\n\n I mean seriously we can talk for days about the list of things this guy's done wrong, was unconstitutional, as a threat to not just the average American but the world as a whole ( remember his nuclear comments) but hey let's just keep bitching about Donald Trump on our politics because that's going to affect real change!"
'Too bad the electoral college failed to realize their purpose of existing when they went ahead and voted for him anyway.'
'I am heartened by the American political system. It is remarkably resilient.\n\nThe system was designed to work against a pandering demagogue like DJT.\n\nFirst, it was designed to ensure he didn\'t win the election. And it came close, but ultimately failed in that regard.\n\nThen you have Congress and the federal courts. Republicans in Congress have essentially doubled down on Trump\'s "populism", thinking it\'s easier to deal with him now and just consider him an ambulatory hand to sign their legislation into law, as opposed to rejecting him and all he stands for, as they should have done to maintain their last vestiges of credibility.\n\nBut as Congress has failed (until November...), the courts have stepped up, over things like his Muslim ban, DACA, EPA regulations, and several other major policy areas. They have checked his worst excesses, exactly as they were meant to.\n\nThis is why, even after all this shit and everything that\'s happened over the past ~15 months, I am optimistic for the future.\n\nThe system is working, and it is blocking or delaying Trump where it matters most. And no amount of Tweets is going to change that.\n\nBut the people have to do their part. Vote in November. Vote in every election from now until the end of time. Vote the Republicans into the Dark Ages for inflicting this shit on us and enabling such a wholly unqualified and unsuitable person to be president. Make them regret it over and over and over again.\n\nThen and only then can we say that the problem has been resolved. '
'The fact that he can pardon everyone indicted, fire the guy investigating him, and cannot be charged with any crime unless the opposite party is in charge of Congress means they did a fucking shitty job planning for him.'
"Forefathers planned for you...yet he still gets elected, is still in office, is still not impeached. Not trying to jab here, but if they did plan for this, it failed and his presidency shouldn't be left to the forefathers, but people living currently to handle it."
'Well, they tried, but that failed spectacularly. \n\nAlexander Hamilton on the electoral college:\n"the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications."\n\n'
'Every time I see someone warning Trump not to make a mistake it’s  or wrong decision it comes with the title of “former” we can listen to these former government officials who are now private citizens all day long. Wake up! It’s the people in office **now**. Trump disregards current people in government. We already know if he fires Mueller there will be backlash, from the people. But not by the government. Both Dems and Reps will go about how they tend to. The left will criticize Trump and the right will ignore it and move on. We’re not operating on normal ethical etiquette here. We’re running on Trump’s. It’s been more than a year. How long will it take people to figure this out already. The man has been apart of scandal week in week out. Things have changed. Politics have changed. Ethics for being president have changed.'

"President Trump strikes me as one of the most lonely souls on the planet who has never known the joy of love. To lie incessantly, create countless false narratives and seem to actually believe himself.....now that's a sad, spiritually destitute man."

"Correction: No Public Official can block users on Twitter.\n\nUnless you're really going to twist the law into a pretzel and try to say that this only applies to Trump and only Trump and no other government official.\n\nAlso seeing as this ruling essentially renders Twitter a Public Forum, doesn't that mean that Twitter itself can't ban or censor anyone on it since it would be a violation of that user's First Amendment rights?"
'How the hell will they enforce that?'

'
"Does no one worry that this will backfire?\n\nAs I understand what was said, no public official can block anyone? If anything comes of this, does that mean all of my accounts will be unblocked? Or only my accounts where I'm pretending to be an American?\n\nEven if it specifically only refers to the POTUS (though that's not what I saw), do you not worry about a potential precedent being set for when <your team> is next in power? As many of you keep stating, we're dedicated to our trolling.\n\nHonest question from an English Trump supporter. While I fully expect to lose fake internet points, please answer me when you downvote, I'm interested in your opinions."
"I hate Trump with a passion but this is stupid. Why should people have the right to tweet at the president? It's not like you can't see his tweets if you are blocked."
'I suspect they will say @realdonaldtrump is not the official Presidential twitter, @POTUS is. It doesn\'t matter which he uses most, and where he makes "presidential" declarations. We obviously live in a timeline where everything that makes sense is ludicrous, and when you commit treason you\'re a real american. '
'He should be the one blocked, that dumbass'
'This should apply to all elected officials. At the very least they shouldn’t be able to block their constituents. My state senator blocked me last year. '
'Dam alot of misconceptions here. The judges ruling is that Donald Trump using the tag @therealdonaldtrump cannot block users "for thier political views" the judge also mentions that specifically because the tag is of the president and its been the presidents primary use of Twitter to make statements that led the judge to make the claim of his tag constitutes a public forum. Based on what I read I\'m thinking a few different things here. \n \nOne: this will have no effect on Twitter as a company, the ruling states this is for government tags only, and it was trumps choice not to create a new presidential tag\n\nTwo: this doesn\'t effect free speech on Twitter, Twitter has rules and regulations that a regular person with no power or weight agrees to, this ruling was specifically about the U. S. Governments use of Twitter as a platform. It\'s on the U. S. Government to enforce this ruling, not Twitter. \n \nThree: if you go on Trumps Twitter and say I hate you, you suck, he can block you for a personal attack. Someone saying "your tax cut implementation shows you have no understanding of modern economics" would be protected by this ruling. '
'the whole fucking thing seems surreal. the potus blocking people who disagree like hes in Mean Girls or some shit. fuck this piece of shit snowflake ass pussy bitch president.'
"Can Trump be held in contempt of court or anything if he doesn't unblock people or continues blocking people?\n\nAlso how exactly will this be enforced? Since twitter obviously allows people from other countries to be involved, won't people need to prove they're actually American citizens to get unblocked?"

"This is just more proof to point to (not that we needed it) that Trump isn't going to change. He is utterly unconcerned with what people think and, I believe, is allowed to think is in part because if he does run again the Electoral College will keep him in the game. He knows how to talk to angry white people. \n\nAs the child of 2 Trumpers, this has been shown to me to be incredibly and horrifically true."

'Another lesson in Dictatorship 101, attack the people with clearances who are critical of you. '
'Why would anyone have a problem with this?\n\n**Edit:** Sorry, I meant "Why would**n\'t** anyone have a problem with this?'
'This bitch is jealous cuz his minions can’t get security clearance. '
'Some of these guys don\'t even have security clearances anymore because Trump fired them and they were "read-out". Jesus H Christ you\'d think they\'d do their homework on their supposed enemies before releasing a list like that.\n\nEdit: This says nothing about the can of worms for punishing people for exercising their First Amendment rights. Or the damage caused to national security by losing the knowledge and experience of former employees who had a clearance.'
'How long before trump explores the idea of making it illegal to criticize him'
'This is petty as all hell.\n\nThey no longer work for the government. Their clearances are already inactive. There is no national security threat, since none of them carry clearance or have access to classified information.'
"First his all caps tweet this morning... now this.\n\nWhat has Mueller found or who has he spoken to that's got Trump so terrified that he's pushed out TWO attempts at distractions today already?"
"Could Donny stop acting like a deeply guilty mafia boss motherfucker for just 1 week?\n\nPlease?\n\nIt's like Manafort's trial this week and Cohen's slow flip Cult45* is a wee bit panicked. "

"For those of you who never worked in the defense industry:\n\nPeople who work for the government directly or indirectly in roles that require clearance tend to specialize and stay in that industry. Clearances take at least six months to get, often longer, and involve thorough investigations of the applicant including but not limited to interviews with every meaningful person from the applicant's past. Losing a clearance can be devastating to some employees, whose employer may have nothing else for them to do, forcing an immediate layoff or demotion. No one likes to talk about this, but it can also make it harder to regain any clearance, pushing some people into abrupt career changes."

"Let's put this in a little perspective.  $43 Million is a lot of money, A LOT of money.  If the average American makes around, let's say, $50,000 per year, then the entire annual wages of 860 Americans went to our president so he could play golf.  The person in the highest office of CIVIL SERVANT in America stole an entire single month's earnings from 10,320 citizens out of the year so he could do anything but work.  20,640 people lost a normal 2-week paycheck straight to the federal government last year so our fat, stupid, sociopathic, apathetic, lying sack of shit troll doll of a president could put our money back into his own pockets at his own damn resorts."
'No more wasteful spending complaints from Republicans. Never again'
"This might be an unpopular opinion... but I'm at the point now that I want Trump golfing 24/7. The more time he's out there means the less time he's in the Oval Office fucking shit up or livetweeting Fox & Friends or starting another Twitter spat.

"She's 100% right, they are all fucking pieces of shit for letting it still happen. It's been 18 or so school shootings this year, some 30 mass shootings this year. I looked it up earlier, if this keeps going at this pace, by mid March, 10 weeks into this year - not even a quarter of a year in, the United States will have more school shooting with 320 million people than all of Europe (not only the EU but also Russia) with 740 million people in the last 105 years since the first one in 1913.\n\n105 years vs 12 weeks. I mean, get your fucking shit together.\n\n\nEDIT: sure, the numbers might not be 100% accurate in the US school shootings numbers... even if its just 2, it's too many. but lets be real, there are school shooting drills, in some states even mandatory. I think it has gone too far and there have been too many.\n\nregulate the requirements to buy and own guns. as I said in one of the comments:\n\nIf you want a gun, tell me why and for what:\n\n * Hunting? Long barrel hunting rifle and a six shot revolver.\n * Sports? A gun that fits the exact description of your sport with proof that your participating in the sport in some way.\n * Self defense? Against whom? Existing restraining orders? Show evidence and then get a tiny revolver for self defense.\n\nNowhere in any case you'd need a AR-15 as a private citizen. And in all cases, weapon and ammo storage in separate rooms, controlled by the police, you break the rules you lose your rights to own a gun. Can't lose those rights? Talk to people who committed a felony.\n\nIf you want to have fun outside, go buy a jet ski. If you want to shoot stuff, go buy an airsoft or a paintball gun, at least that way you're gonna move your ass around a bit."

'How does Trump tweeting "thought and condolences" make him a piece a shit. What is he supposed to do? Every time theres a school shooting people on one side says we need teachers to carry guns in school and on the other side people say we need to ban all guns. Both sides are idiots. This is a mental health issue. We keep ignoring what drives the killer to kill and just say we need gun reform but the sad truth is probably no law could have prevented this. A killer will find a way to kill if he Truly wants to. If not a gun then with a bomb, if not with a bomb than with a truck. Trump is right no child should feel unsafe in school. As a Firefighter/EMT  I see crazy people every day never get the true help they need, the get checked in to the yellow wing of the hospital for 24 hours pump them full of sedatives and then released into the public. How does this fix anything. And people wonder why I conceal carry. '

But damn that dragon that looked like a duck in Adventure! \n\nI worked with a guy who wasn’t into video games but was a HUGE gun nut and NRA member. He felt that as an American civilian, he had the right to own any gun out there including a rocket launcher! True nut job and a hot head to boot! He threatened to shoot one guy we worked with. I told the guy he should go to HR, but he didn’t want to get the other guy fired. Me and a few guys joked that he’d go off one day and come in shooting. Glad I don’t work there anymore. '

'I really have to ask my conservative friends: What the fuck are you so afraid of? \n\nIf there is one force that is ruining this country more than any other, more than any president or organization or policy, it\'s FEAR. America is irrational fearful and paranoid of so much.\n\nXenophobia. Racism. Sexism. Homophobia. They are all born from fear.\n\nIs this the kinda country we aspire to be?  Land of the fearful, home of the afraid. Is that what makes America great? \n\nWhat does the NRA and their ilk use to promote their agenda?  Fear. "They\'re gonna take away your guns! They wanna leave you defenseless as a bad guy shoots up your kid\'s school!" Fear is what they\'re selling, and fear is what America is buying.\n\nOr Fox News. Again, merchants of fear. "The Deep State is destroying America from within! Liberal pizza rapists are letting Mexican socialists cast illegal votes for Hillary!" Fear is what they\'re showing, and fear is what America is tuning in for.\n\nIt\'s fuckin ridiculous. The amount of knee jerk irrational hatred and paranoia that rules this country. \n\nOf course, it\'s not a recent phenomenon. We were born out of fear and paranoia and hate. It\'s why we wiped out the natives. Its why we had to fight a civil war over black slavery. It\'s why we banned certain ethnicities or nationalities from coming here. It\'s why we had Jim Crow. It\'s why we interred Americans of Japanese descent in concentration camps. It\'s why an entire generation is repulsed by the word "socialism" meaning we can\'t have universal healthcare and not be burdened for life for choosing to go to college.\n\nBut I guess there\'s one thing we don\'t fear. We don\'t fear gun violence. Columbine didn\'t make us afraid of our kids getting shot up. Aurora didn\'t make us afraid of our kids getting shot up. Virginia Tech didn\'t make us afraid of our kids getting shot up. Fucking Sandy Hook didn\'t make us afraid enough. Las Vegas didn\'t make us afraid enough. Parkland, Florida won\'t either. \n\nBecause the fear of more restrictions on gun rights is greater than the fear of a gun\'s right to restrict life I guess.\n\nSo. Is this what the fuck America is?  Have we, particularly those on the right, decided that we need to be constantly afraid, clutching to our AR-15s against mostly imaginary and vastly overblown threats, while the REAL threat, the merchants feeding you this fear and paranoia, drag us further into the dark?  \n\nWe really are a pathetic joke at this point.'

Something else is seriously wrong with society in America and while adding more laws to control firearms will probably cause less people to die, it's not going to fix the root cause of the problem. "
'This problem will only be solved with both better gun control, better common understanding and empathy for mental illness and universal healthcare to treat mental illness.\n\nWe stigmatize mental illness in this country. So not only do people not understand mental illness those that suffer from it may not recognize symptoms and if they do many won’t come forward to seek help.\n\nGet people help!'

'In November of 2015 near the beginning of his campaign Trump retweeted an image that originated from a white supremacist. This image claimed a bunch of murder statistics about black people (like they\'re responsible for 81% of murders of whites). These statistics are blatantly false and the bureau listed on the image doesn\'t exist. When questioned about why he would retweet such a racially provocative and false image he defended himself by saying "Am I going to check every statistic?" \n\nThen this past weekend he balked when given several opportunities to denounce white supremacists and waited several days to do such only doing so after much public pressure. When he finally did, his excuse for waiting was to say "I want to know the facts."\n\nSo according to Trump\'s own words when it\'s pro white supremacy, he doesn\'t check statistics, but when it\'s anti white supremacy he needs to know the facts.'

">...currently the Affordable Care Act forbids insurers from discriminating against sick patients by denying them coverage or charging them higher premiums. Graham-Cassidy, however, wouldn’t simply allow waivers of Obamacare’s protections for people with preexisting conditions. It would also permit insurers to charge higher premiums to people who are currently insured through the Obamacare exchanges as a condition of “continued enrollment.”\n\n>In essence, an insurer could take someone’s money for years while that individual is healthy. Then, on the day that that person is diagnosed with cancer, jack up their premiums so high that they are no longer affordable. Healthy people would have insurance until the moment they need it, at which point their premiums could become prohibitively expensive.\n\nWell, that's disturbing."

Besides being the mouth-breathing mouthpiece for "repeal and replace", how much has Trump *actually* done to create this bill?\n\nTrump is a convenient scapegoat and that\'s exactly what the Republican fucks are counting on. Calling this Trumpcare is exactly what they want, and by allowing Trump to take the blame name it implies that it\'s *his* fault that we got shafted - not the Republicans who neutered the original ACA, not the Republicans who spent years saying the bill was a failure, not the Republicans who spent years tying it to Obama and saying anything Obama did was obviously bad, not the Republicans who *drafted the new bill.* And when Trump is out of office, R voters will remember Trumpcare as "the sucky healthcare bill that *Trump* made - but the *next Republican* will get it right!"\n\n**The new Healthcare bill is Republicare.** Calling it anything else is counterproductive.'

Additionally, if the insurance company offers Medicare services, then in nearly ALL cases, that coompany is non-profit.  Not, Not for Profit, but non-profit.  The insurance company can't profit more than 2% between what it received in premiums and what it pays out to providers.  Any profit over 2% must be reinvested into the community.

'Look at how we are all screwed! Great work, GOP... Now millions of Americans will die so your rich buddies can save a couple of bucks. \n\nBasically, this is the same failing healthcare plan we had before.

" Did he pack up a backpack at the end of the work day or was he taking pictures off his desk and putting them in a box with everything else?\n\nThis article is trash if you\'re looking to actually be informed of anything'

'They have emails between this woman and her sister discussing the incident in 2006.  If NBC releases those emails...I wonder how the White House would respond.  That’s not definitive proof or good enough evidence for Republicans to probably call for an investigation but you can’t say that she’s making this up for publicity all of sudden because Trump got elected president unless she traveled back in time a decade to exchange emails with her sister.\n\nEdit: For the people who are saying that emails could be faked and mean it seriously, THIS PERSON IS ASKING CONGRESS TO INVESTIGATE THE PRESIDENT.  Do you realize how much trouble you would get into if you were to take falsified documents and present them as evidence to congress in a sexual misconduct investigation against the president of the United States?  She’s asking Congress to invite her to testify under oath about what happened to her at Trump Tower and I imagine she expects some members of congress ask her about her damn emails because they are obsessed with emails.  \n\nEdit # 2: The emails are with her sister.  She didn’t come forward in 2006 because she was scared she would lose her job.  If it was because she wanted to get famous, she would have come out previously.  If she wanted money, she would have gone to a lawyer.  \n\nShe went to her *sister.* You might see a woman looking for money or fame but I see a woman here who in 2006 sought out her sister because she felt violated and confused and was looking for comfort.  Now she’s asking Congress for an investigation and I hope that they are willing to help her find justice.'

'The reason republicans ignore stories like this is because if they were to accept this, then they would have to change their views on Trump, which in turn would mean they would have to change their political beliefs. \nChanging one\'s political beliefs is something that is almost impossible because that means that we are admitting that we were wrong in our beliefs, and if we admit we are wrong in our beliefs, our entire sense of self disintegrates. \n\nThis is not just a "republican" thing or "right" thing. The same goes for democrats or left leaning political folk. If something does not fit our belief system we choose to ignore it no matter how drastic because it is easier than admitting the way we think and see the world may be wrong.

They are active voters though which is why we see these problems today. We must be active about this to counter it. Make posts on social media, strike up conversations about the fairness doctrine that was removed to our bewilderment. Explain the problems inherent with cronyism in FCC and EPA.

I don’t know why people keep accepting this as fact. There is a good chance Pence is up to his neck in this. \n\nThe timeline is this:\n\n* December 29, 2016. Flynn speaks to Kislyak about sanctions. He lets his deputy, McFarland, know he is doing this. McFarland emails this information around that day to a group [including Priebus, Spicer, Bannon and two unknowns] (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/us/russia-mcfarland-flynn-trump-emails.html).\n\n* January 10, 2017.

The Russia story is red-hot. The Trump team deploys its three most “establishment” members, Pence, Priebus and Spicer, to publicly push back. All say they have spoken to Flynn, who never spoke about sanctions. Priebus and Spicer, at least, are lying as they knew very well that he *did* speak about sanctions. Pence is either being actively deceived by each of Flynn, Priebus and Spicer, or he knows and is lying too. \n\n* January 24. Flynn is interviewed by the FBI. We now know he lied, saying he didn’t discuss sanctions with Kislyak. \n\n* January 26. [Yates briefs McGahan] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/08/full-transcript-sally-yates-and-james-clapper-testify-on-russian-election-interference/).

Trump invites Comey to a surprise dinner that night and [demands loyalty] (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/11/us/politics/trump-clinton-firing.html).\n\nTo me, the story about Flynn being fired for deceiving Pence and the others is clearly hokum. \n\nThe circumstances point instead to a conspiracy (whether or not it fits the legal definition of one) to cover up the true, incriminating nature of Flynn’s call, involving at the very least Priebus and Spicer. I find it hard to believe that either apparatchik would go to such lengths on their own, and to deliberately keep Trump and Pence out of the loop. \n\nThat is, I strongly suspect both Trump and Pence were in on it. If so, let’s hope Mueller has something on Ryan too.\n\n*Edit* - added a couple of links.  '

'I know there are 2 school of thoughts, 2 ways to see the story. No real truth. My question is... If Trump did not colluded with Russians in the election seas... Would be morally and ethically correct to charge him with obstruction? To a president that (so far) has not been proven to be elected illegally? Should other charges like conspiracy to steal the elections come before obstruction?'
"Can we all finally agree that Flynn was a lying POS that needed to be fired? He was bad news no matter which side you're on."
"Jeeze, who wrote this crappy spin job? Flynn was ambushed. McCabe and Yates set him up for an interview, without telling him that's what it was. "
'Well this is good. So now the “big bad trump told me to say it” argument won’t hold any water, when his testimony suggests no wrong doing.'

"Nobody knew who Walter Shaub was before Donald Trump became president. ... He immediately thrust himself into the limelight instead of being helpful on the issues where he could have been. It was more about him than about ethics.”\n\nThis reminds me of my time in the military, where every mistake becomes a fault of the person\'s character, and a personal insult to the observer. "That person\'s uniform isn\'t completely right, so he\'s a shit soldier and everyone around him is shit too because they didn\'t correct him." "The paperwork wasn\'t filled out right, so he\'s a shit soldier, and his sergeant set him up to fail. I will make sure neither of them get promoted." That\'s fine for Type A personalities who want to play your games, but it doesn\'t invite people who are just on the fence about your priorities. \n\nThe thing that I hate most about the Trump administration is the assumption that everyone has a personal motivation for their actions and cannot be professional. I mean, you see a lot of times in politics when people try to score political points by throwing ad hominem shade at their opponents, but they don\'t act as thoroughly on the assumption as the Trump admin has. They\'ve tried to clear out anyone who served under Obama, even if they were appointed during the Bush admin, just because they can\'t imagine someone who can work for Obama (because they are professionals) can also work for them with the same professionalism. It\'s toxic partisanism at its worst. '

Honestly, I am not american, but all I can do is appeal to EVERY american person that is sick of all these lies to teach Trump a lesson by going to vote and not rely on other people... Hell, even if you never ever want to vote for the democrats, there should be other options to vote for  (even if people call your vote wasted, still do it to sent a statement...) \n\nWe had that shit with the Brexit over here in Europe, I've read quite a few statements where people said they didn't vote because they thought that enough voters would turn up to stop the Brexit and look at the mess we have right now..."
'Too bad the word is already out that this law was "handed to them" by the Democrats.  Conclusive proof won\'t matter. Trump\'s base will chalk this up as fault of Dems and that\'s the end of that. '
'Trump takes a big dump in his own bathroom and blames Democrats for the god-awful stink.  Should this be any surprise?'
'The problem isn’t whether Trump is lying (he is, as always). The problem is that this is still ongoing. '
'People have to stop responding to Trump administration lies with nuanced fact checking as if it\'s going to make a difference.\n\nThey\'re lying. Everyone knows they\'re lying. That\'s what needs to be said, by everyone, over and over again. The more time you put into a well crafted think piece explaining how report A and document C refute claim B just gives people the impression that there\'s nuance and "two sides" to this issue. There isn\'t. It\'s the fucking liars and everyone else.'
"This is absolutely horrific. This goes beyond borders and nations and politics. What is happening to these families. Children. Mothers. Fathers. Brothers. Sisters. If you have a pulse and this doesn't get your blood boiling then something is wrong. This needs to be a top priority to fix and it needs to happen now. "
'Finally they specify what law they are talking about. I was pretty sure Trump was referring to US Code 8, Section 1325 but he never said the specific law.\n\nBy the way, our law as it stands says an alien illegally entering the country \n>shall, for the first commission of any such offense, be fined under title 18 or imprisoned not more than 6 months, or both\n\nThere is an option to pursue civil OR criminal action OR both. From what I gather, Obama\'s administration only did the fine for first offenders, whereas Jeff Sessions is going straight to imprisonment.\nThat /is/ within their power, but I\'m quite upset that Trump is blaming this on the Democrats when it was 100% his administration that is enforcing it this way. Trump says it\'s some of the Dem\'s "horrible and cruel legislative agenda" as if he doesn\'t want to but then refuses to treat the law the way previous administrations did anyway?'
'What is the point of prosecuting these crossers? By detaining them and their children until a hearing it requires a lot of money. They should be rounded up and evicted from the country instead. Then kids are not separated, or even lost. Families stay together, and they still get expelled from america.\nWhat kind of punishment do they receive when convicted of crossing illegally? Are they held in our jail to serve time? Or are they just expelled? Im sorry, i dont know enough about what actually happens. '
'>A "zero tolerance" policy from Attorney General Jeff Sessions mandates that anyone illegally crossing the border be treated like a criminal.\n\nAnyone illegally crossing the border *is* a criminal by definition. The question is whether they are in fact illegal to begin with (refugees are not illegal immigrants) and whether their treatment constitutes "cruel and unusual punishment".'
'This is a ploy to scapegoat Sessions so he can be removed from his position, replaced, and someone step in to curb the Mueller investigation or hamper it. This administration is not stupid. They’re brash, bold, and know how to get away with shit. They’ve been doing it for five decades and won’t stop until action is taken. \n\nOur Representatives need to stop using Twitter and doing nothing to stop it other than speak. Pressure them, hold their policies now and in the future in jeopardy. Someone like Schiff should just tell them the game is up in two years. Start treating people correctly now or get nothing done again, ever. '
"You can provide all the proof in the world and it won't matter.  \n\nThe far right is not interested in proof, because it is not interested in reality in the first place.  Fundamentalists and conservatives would rather continue doing hateful things that have no basis in reality no matter how many examples you give them that they're wrong, than have to admit, even once, that their political ideas are incorrect.  \n\nUntil the rest of the world shows them that this is incredibly stupid and unacceptable, they won't change.  "
"I know r/politics is using an echo-chamber for trump-hate, but read the article.\n\n> Unauthorized border crossings have always been illegal, but previous administrations did not criminally prosecute all border-crossers.\n\n>Trump's Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, began the process of treating all border crossers as criminals.\n\n\nThis is the biggest change from previous administrations to the current, one let illegal entries slide (enabling crime, etc.) and this one is putting a stop to that laxity towards our nation's rule of law. It's not America's fault for these parents knowingly endangering their kids and their personal freedom by trying to gain entry to America illegally. Sorry, but no sympathy.\n\n"
"I've been disgusted with my country before. I've never been ashamed until now. And I feel completely helpless. "
"I wanna help, but I'm not smart enough to know what to do. I mean I rage tweeted homeland security that they are a fucking disgrace to humanity but that is probably not enough."
"Well, duh. He's doing vile things to discourage immigration. Thats what he's said all along. "
"I find it absolutely incredulous that we have to prove this is Trump's policy.  It's not Democrats rounding up people at the border, they have no majority control over any of the three branches of the US government, they introduced no legislation to do this and we're actually having to argue this is not their fault.  \n\nBlaming this on democrats is like kidnapping someone and then blaming the person you're trying to extort for the kidnapping because they didn't give into your demands.

'Bragged. He bragged about sexual assault. He was so desperate for approval from Billy Bush that he bragged about assaulting women.\n\nThose are apparently leadership qualities in the 21st Century.'
"lol he admitted before the elections, and was voted in despite it. The American population does not care about sexual assault. *Women* proudly voted for this man. It is appalling and disgusting, but let's not pretend like he's going to step down like Franken, or face any consequence."
"It's so infuriating how the left tries to be moral, but the right has no morals and gives no shits. Not to mention supplants with their own reality. I mean for fucks sake:\n\nFranken resigned, Conyers resigned, Weinstein lost his company, Weiner is in jail. Meanwhile a guy who goes after underage girls might be a senator, and a harasser and rapist is president. But the right doesn't care they'll support them all the same.\n\nHow the fuck do we even deal with these kinds of people who literally do not care and are in it just to laugh at liberals."
'You grow up thinking that in our justice system punishment depends on the severity of the crime. In reality it also depends to a great extent on how much wealth and power the criminal possesses. \n\nAny time I forget this I revisit the story of [Robert Richards IV of the du Pont family who was convicted of raping his 3 year old daughter and served no jail time.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_and_sentencing_of_Robert_H._Richards_IV)  \n\nThis is not a just world we live in.'
"It's going to be fun watching every Democrat candidate in 2018 point out their Republican opponent had nothing to say about Trump's sexual harrasments & assault. They ***OWN*** this crap now. \n\nThe Republican base might have no problem, but the independents don't like it and the Democrats have been energized since Jan 21st about it.  *EVERY* election this year has seen a major Democrtic surge, even the ones they (closely) lost.  \n\nThe tax bill is further proof even the GOP fears they are about to loose Congress.

They don't care, they don't even believe that it happened, even the things he admitted to.\n\nSex scandals aren't going to be the magic bullet everyone wants.  Only winning back control of Congress will make any difference whatsoever.  You have to get out there an do the work and win elections.  Toss him out not because he is a creep, but because his policies are bad for America.  Start talking shop instead of attacking character.  He never had any, those attacks don't work."
"What's worse is several REAL live women in the double digits stepped forward and shared the horror stories of their encounters with him - not forgetting that at one point a woman claimed that Trump RAPED her when she was just 13 years old, even though she was eventually pressured or paid off into suddenly dropping the charges against him.\n\nHow did America go from having arguably one of the best presidents it ever had to having a flaming bag of dog $hit as president?"
">And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\n\nSo, consensual. I get that the rabid left doesn't like him, but they should come up with more substantial reasons. Shit like this is comparable to the rabid right calling Obama a Muslim. It's petty reaching.\n\nSincerely, A Pacific Green/Sanders supporter."
'It’s even worse.  We pushed Hillary though so she could lose to this guy because we were too caught up in ‘gender issues’'
'I want Trump to be investigated for sexual assault,  but the Access Hollywood tape is not an admission of sexual assaut. His rape of his previous wife, which is catalogued in court documents and never denied however...'

'I still don’t get how this is the focus of America. I mean sure unwanted advances is bad.. \n\nBut let’s be honest.. this guy has ripped apart America’s obligations to climate change... \n\nHe has been chest puffing with North Korea, and now with the whole Arab world... with his Jerusalem stunt. It’s like he is begging to start world war 3. \n\nHe has does everything to take away healthcare from Americans, with the victims being the sick and dying.. (basically killing people). \n\nHe has made your own war vets basically homeless. \n\nBut everyone is focusing on his sex life? I mean I get it.. it’s bad.. \n\nYou impeached Clinton because of a blow job... (rediculous if you ask me). \n\nBut where is the moral compass, when out of all his corruption.. war mongering attitude.. people focus on this.. \n\nHis policies so far are actually killing people. '

"I seriously can't fucking believe that Trump supporters are justifying his sexual assault by arguing the semantics of the word 'let'.  Fucking sad."
"Where'd all the so called rape victims go? I think it's funny he wasn't accused of rape until he ran against the Democrats."
'How did he confess to sexual assault? At worst he confessed to some lewd and overly aggressive come-ons.'
'He never admitted to sexual assault, the "grab them by the pussy" thing was talking about women who consented because he was famous.'
'Anyone who actually thinks this either has major English comprehension problems or is simply lying to themself.'
"He admitted to molesting little girls at all his pageants, ffs.  Ivanka laughed about it during an interview with her dad.  That's how fucked up that family is.  Makes me think that Ivanka was probably molested too or maybe he violently raped her like he did her mother."

"The Democrats better hold hearings everyday and investigate everyone in the White House.\n\nRepublicans held hearings for years about Hillary Clintons emails, during Clintons administration they impeached him over a sex scandal that came out of nowhere.\n\nI am fuming because if we had a Democrat President we would have well on our way to impeachment for much less. They were even threatening Hillary Clinton before she even got to the general election that she would be in deep trouble and be investigated.\n\nWhen the Democrats gained power in 2008 they didn't go after a single a Republican despite all the lies and harm caused by the Iraq War. Now Republicans are trying bring up some bullshit about uranium from 2009. They need to be dragged over the coals for all of what they did."
'That didn\'t happen. <-- Trump twitter\n\nAnd if it did, it wasn\'t that bad. <-- Trump\'s new at this, "whatabout blah," etc.\n\nAnd if it was, that\'s not a big deal. <-- Trump laywers\n\nAnd it if is, that\'s not my fault. <-- Whitehouse official statements regarding Mueller indictments\n\nAnd if it was, I didn\'t mean it. <-- Kushner/Trump Jr. response to revelations that they were communicating with Wikileaks/Russian lawyers.\n\nAnd if I did, you deserved it. <-- Trump (or his lawyer) said he fired Flynn because he lied to the FBI, admitting obstruction of justice. Trump\'s lawyer now says a President can\'t obstruct justice.\n\nI\'ll just keep updating this until Mueller charges him.'
'Trump is fucked. They know it. No other reason for such a comment to be made.'
'Just like Kelly Anne Conway saying everything the president does is presidential because he’s the president. \n\nThe same kind of middle school level thinking that’s gonna get this idiot impeached and/or jailed. '
'Did not expect to wake up to this. This alone warrants impeachment. Fuck any Republican who stands in the way of bringing this corrupt President to justice.'
"Trump's lawyer is hilariously incompetent :D\n\nHim claiming he wrote Trump's idiotic self-incriminating Tweet about Flynn is beyond hilarious. As if Trump would let him touch his Twitter phone...what a joke! \n\nDon't be fooled by Trump & Co downplaying this...they know a storm is coming. Imo Kusher's toast and the only question is whether he takes Trump down with him or not. Will he rat out his wife's father to save his ass or not, that's the question.\n\nAs for whether there will be a full criminal procedure with possible prison time for Trump...nope, never gonna happen. At best, he'll be forced to step down citing some (mental) health issue and they'll just try to make him get out of the limelight. Would be too embarrassing otherwise...even more so than it already is."
'Is this the world’s shittiest lawyer or what? Supposedly hijack your client’s phone to tweet a confession and then deny that the law applies to your client. Holy shit.'
"The rule of law is supposed to, pardon the expression, trump everything.  We are a nation of laws in which no public servant is above.  It is the very foundation that was laid out by our great forefathers.  \n\nThe fact that anyone would even entertain this bullshit is a clear example of how low we have sunk as a country.  The GOP are openly robbing the coffers for the rich and they don't care.  Our democracy has fallen into darkness and it may be past the point of no return for this country.  \n\nHowever we get out of it on the other side, we won't be the same nation as we were before going in.  This is incredibly sad to witness."
"I'll drop this right here.\n\nArticle 2, Section 4.  DISQUALIFICATION\n\nThe President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, *and Conviction* of, Treason, Bribery, *or* other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\n\nThat implies to me there is NO protection for *conviction* of Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.  In fact, treason has to be stated in OPEN COURT.  How can you do this, with alleged immunity?  It's contradictory!!!!!!   Congress only gets to decide punishment.  Separation of powers, IT MUST be done in the courts, not the legislature.  It seems to me, you CAN indict a sitting president.\n\nOtherwise the argument presented means that all public representatives have to be impeached first before charges are brought.  This is obviously *NOT TRUE*.  Charges can be brought against sitting ANYONE in public officials.\n\nAm I reading this wrong?"
"No wonder Trump doesn't know when to stop talking.  His own lawyer doesn't even know when to stop talking. "

"> Bornstein said he was not given a form authorizing the release of the records and signed by the president —known as a HIPAA release — which is a violation of patient privacy law. \n\nWhat the fuck. This is ridiculous, does the guy have security tape or witnesses to back him? And forget Trump' s files, does this doctor have other patients records stored alongside Trump's? This is insane."
"I know we've become immune to shit like this but worth reminding everyone if this were ANY other president, this would be an impeachable offense. The president sent hired thugs to a doctor's office to suppress medical records and it's a fucking blip on the radar. Are you kidding me?! This is what's so dangerous and effective about Trump normalizing this kind of behavior. We think, oh look, just another scandal. But it's every, single, day. It's not an anomaly. This is persistent and pervasive corruption at the highest levels of government."
"Wait, Obama is sick? What does he know that we don't!? /s\n\nAnyway, this probably happened and seems illegal. Nothing will be done about it. "
"That's the problem with American health care. Don't you hate it when you want to switch doctors, you have to hire two goons and a lawyer to steal your medical records and threaten to beat up your old doctor if he snitches to the media? It's a big pain in the ass."
'>Bornstein told NBC News that he felt "raped, frightened and sad" when Keith Schiller and another "large man" came to his office to collect the president\'s records on the morning of Feb. 3, 2017.\n\nHow many want to bet that the \'large man\' matches the description Stormy Daniels gave a couple of weeks ago to the sketch artist?'

"Trump has the potential to be our generation's Hitler and all... But apparently this doctor violated HIPPA? I would be suing my doctor if they told a newspaper anything about my health."
"*Tin foil hat on*\n\nRonny Jackson knew Trump had serious issues, but the administration knew Ronny had done some bad stuff that would not only tank his career, but also result in serious discipline from the military. They basically forced him to get out in front of the press and claim Trump is the healthiest man alive in exchange for keeping hush  about his habits of handing out pills and harassing women.\n\nThey also went and seized the only evidence of Trump's problems, which were records kept by his personal doctor.\n\n*tin foil hat off*"
"I detest Trump but his doc had no damned business telling a newspaper anything about his medical records.  We wouldn't appreciate it.  It's not right."
"Not that I'm defending these goons but the fact that the doctor divulged what medications he prescribed his patient is a pretty severe HIPAA violation.  I'm not sure I'd want my records with him either."
'How long before Trump incriminates himself over this on Fox News and declares, "It is only felony if you destroy someone else\'s records".'
'So this guy wrote a bullshit bill of health.\n\nClaimed the President takes Propecia.\n\nGot records stolen violating HIPA for trump and his "fake names?"\n\nOk, anything else?\n\n\n'
"Raiding a doctor's office like that is not right, but the doctor is not innocent in this affair either. He should not be telling newspapers what medicine he prescribed anyone. That's a HIPAA violation. The whole thing all around is spectacularly stupid."

I have no idea how this man still has his license. This is a *MASSIVE* HIPAA violation. I would be furious if this happened to me. Also, people are absolutely entitled to have their records. The methods, obviously, were not right, and if true, illegal. But this entire thing seems so bizarre I don\'t know whats true. This also happened over a year ago.    \n    \nThat being said, totally seems in line with Trumps normal MO. '

'The IG report proves he was a leaker and a liar, including lying under oath. The FBI fired him because of that, and Trump called him a leaker and a liar. Now he\'s being referred for prosecution.

"Wrongful termination" when your employer has proof you leaked information and lied under oath and a 25 page internal review spelling out how you violated FBI policies and recommending your termination.

"Nice!  \n\nMcCabe's lawyers get to do discovery, which would include any/all documents, emails, conversations related to his termination.  Since talk of his firing had been going on for months, they could be digging through a lot of damning information, including stuff related to obstruction.  \n\nMy bet is that this is settled long before discovery.  \n\n\n\n"
'Trump is so used to bullying around small contractors and pornstars with threats of lawsuits and bogus contracts, he didn’t realize it wouldn’t work once he made it to the big leagues.

Those dumb threats don’t work with people who actually know the law.'

'>\tPeople don’t realize that all of their consumer behavior—every time they swipe their credit card, what websites they visit, the TV shows they watch—is being re-connected to your voter file and processed internationally,” Carroll says. “And we can’t opt out of it.”\n\n>\tMcKew tells Mother Jones. “Why does some company incorporated in the United Kingdom have [our data]? What the hell is that for? If it were just about selling shoes, or getting you to buy vitamins or whatever crap—ok, fine. But that’s not what it’s being used for, and they specifically say that. [SCL] is a company that’s marketing themselves as a military-grade psychological warfare and psychological operations company. That is a problem for all of us.”\n\nEvery concerned American voter needs to swamp Cambridge with the same Data requests and then flood them with lawsuits. This is insane. '
'Well, i’ll be damned ... who knew the depth of deceit on so many levels?  Just sickens me'
"I think that this is a totally separate issue from the Russian interference, but is something that our laws need to address. \n\nThe issue is that every American has had a very detailed profile built of them. This profile is used for highly targeted marketing, both consumer, and now political. \n\nThis marketing is virtually private, which is what makes it a problem. A candidate can be marketed as pro-gun to one person and anti-gun to another person. Even if that is too extreme, at the very least the candidate can simply not reveal his position on guns to the voter with which he differs, and focus on other issues where the two are more aligned.\n\nI don't think that Trump broke any laws by using this technology. It is simply a more detailed version of the voting database that Obama used in 2008 and 2012, it now has psychological profiles attached to each voter."
'What interests me is how yet another arm of the Trump empire takes industry standard practices (data collection for election) and fucks it up to the point of breaking various laws - just because, fuck it. At this point, it is intentional incompetence. '
"I've been spending the last 4-5 years clouding whatever files they have on me with misinformation \n\nI can't imagine I'm any match for AI but whatever profile they built on me is a collective of false narratives I've put out about myself along with different attitudes and character traits I've portrayed online. I've made falsified relationships and baited with fake interests for the longest time. Every platform I use I have multiple accounts I access from multiple locations and use a spread of multiple behaviors and attitudes I post with. I've never kept the same phone number or service for long. Have jumped in and out of using things like Tor and Tails as well as paid for other people's accounts to use for browsing and to throw GPS trackers off. It's been a hell of a ride"
'Horrible news surfaces.\n\nUnbelievable.\n\nPeople seem upset. \n\nFeel hopeful.\n\nNothing happens.'
"I remember reading that SCL had its fingers in multiple countries' elections, including in Africa and the Philippines. If this is the case, this is some nasty global Bilderberg shit of the highest order. Anyone have any breadcrumbs on this?"

'https://psmag.com/news/a-guide-to-treason-2-0\n\nMore at link.\n\nWhat one scholar describes as a “non-kinetic effects approach” would determine whether cyber attacks constitute armed attacks, or acts of war, based on their effects rather than on any requirement of physical force. This scholar marshals a compelling historical example as support for this notion: naval blockades. He argues that the Framers saw any large-scale disruption of commerce or interference with a right, and concomitant economic threat, as an act of war. This interpretation comports with the Greathouse court’s language concerning acts that were tantamount to “defeat[ing] the execution and compel[ling] the repeal of … public laws.”\n\nThe final thorny term, “assembled,” must also be updated. But if a cyber attack can be an act of war, a cohort linked by bytes and wires coordinating with one another to perpetrate such an attack has surely assembled. And there are certainly those in government who have gone through just such reasoning: Senator John McCain, amongothers, has stated that the Russian cyber attack was an act of war\n\nAid and comfort.\n\nGiving a speech\u200a—\u200aor, say, sending a tweet\u200a—\u200apromoting an enemy, to say nothing of reorienting foreign policy in that enemy’s favor, could arguably satisfy the “rendering … aid and comfort” criterion. And if an intent to aid that enemy can be shown, adherence can sometimes be established by inference. It may be that if words and actions offering aid and comfort were found to be part of a pattern, “the cumulative effect of such a series of addresses or articles would, within the rules of law, be held to afford suitable foundation for a finding by a jury that the accused not only adhered to the enemy, but gave them aid and comfort.”\n\nCompelling.  Very compelling.'
'Why do we, as Americans, have to suck so bad?  0 consumer data protections?  The very fact that all this happens, potentially, on British soil is the saving grace and a glaring contrast in how much it sucks how we, as citizens, are treated.'
"A firm collecting massive amounts of data is frightening, but hardly exclusive to Trump or the GOP. That said, if it's discovered that this data was given to the Russians in order for them to work their propaganda campaigns- that could be very problematic for Trump Inc. indeed. "

'It’s ironic that this hard-working woman is so hated by so many people she wanted to protect.\n\nI watched every minute of every debate. Trump lied his ass off. He could have only possibly sounded reasonable to people who are uninformed or misinformed.\n\nShe made a serious accusation when she said that he was a Russian puppet. His response was wholly inadequate, and 60 million morons didn’t know or care. It’s pathetic how thin the veneer of faux patriotism is on these 60 million weaponized morons.'
'People keep focusing on the fact that he sided with Russia over American intelligence agencies.  And that’s incredibly bad and potentially treasonous, but he also publicly just stated at a press conference with our enemy that America is to blame and is the bad actor in the hostile relationship between the two countries.  That’s much worse IMO and is absolutely treasonous and be must be removed from office immediately.  He has publicly told us where his loyalty lies.  It is undeniable.'

Whether you want to believe he was involved in this is entirely separate from this point.

'The world is complex, and unfortunately, the poorly educated require easy answers.  Populism externalizes an "enemy" that if eridcated will restore things back to a nostalgic past that never existed.  Hitler had the Jews , Bush had the Muslims, and Trump has Mexicans and frankly any foreigner.  Populism does not address the social, economic, or political structures that causes society\'s ills.  The finger never points back to itself but to an effigy. In the case of Mexicans and Jews, they are blamed for taking all the jobs because they work too hard and at the sometime tax the social security system by not working hard enough.  Wages are not declining due to immigrants, it is declining because capitalism is the drive for profits at all costs. Why pay an American to makes shoes for 15 dollars an hour when you can produce the same shoe in Vietnam for 1 dollar a day?  As long as right wing propaganda has it\'s throngs of imbeciles distracted or staring off into the distance at imaginary problems, they can get their electorate to actively vote against their best interests.  In 1998, Richard Rorty saw the writing on the wall:\n\n"Members of labor unions, and unorganized unskilled workers, will sooner or later realize that their government is not even trying to prevent wages from sinking or to prevent jobs from being exported. Around the same time, they will realize that suburban white-collar workers — themselves desperately afraid of being downsized — are not going to let themselves be taxed to provide social benefits for anyone else.\nAt that point, something will crack. The nonsuburban electorate will decide that the system has failed and start looking around for a strongman to vote for — someone willing to assure them that, once he is elected, the smug bureaucrats, tricky lawyers, overpaid bond salesmen, and postmodernist professors will no longer be calling the shots. …\nOne thing that is very likely to happen is that the gains made in the past 40 years by black and brown Americans, and by homosexuals, will be wiped out. Jocular contempt for women will come back into fashion. … All the resentment which badly educated Americans feel about having their manners dictated to them by college graduates will find an outlet."\n\nEdit: fixed date'

"Correction: This also _ONLY_ worked cause the American society defines ignorance and stupidity as valid political opinion. And I can only repeat it 1000 times before I go nuts: But if you guys don't fix that in SOCIETY, you will be ULTRA fucked for decades to come. PLEASE start listening."
'Republican elites, in an attempt to win over working class votes, used cultural populism as a weapon, and now they (and all of us) are reaping the whirlwind.  A bad financial crisis in 2008 reaped the right wing Tea Party movement, which lead directly to Donald J. Trump.  Eventually these movements will crash and burn when their economic ideas hit resistance points, leading to another recession and another political pivot.  '

"Shit's so fucked /r/politics is turning into advice articles."
"I'm starting to feel like the Democrats know our country's fucked, but haven't accepted the fact *dramatic*, painful change is necessary to bring the U.S. back on track.\n\nRepublicans also know our country's fucked, but have accepted the fact that dramatic change is necessary.  **However**, they're going about that change in the worst way imaginable and *will* end up leaving us worse off than we were before.\n\nSo, *what do we do?*  Simply voting out the people we don't like has worked in the past, but today the electoral system has become so rigged against the common people the change we need will never manifest using this method.  Why's the system rigged?  Lobbyists and the mighty dollar bill.\n\nThe Republican party would long be irrelevant today if it weren't for the enormous amount of money divied-up by rich oligarchs to keep marketing and repackaging the same old candidates.  It's less to do with vindictive intent and more to do with how capitalism works, which is to do *anything* to gain the advantage over your competitor.\n\nWhile competition obviously is necessary for a civilization to survive and thrive, there *needs* to be a regulatory counterbalance to split-up the corporations whenever they become too powerful for their own good.\n\nThe first step is to only elect officials that make dismantling the fat cats on Wall Street the core of their campaigns.  If no candidate wishes to step up to the plate, then take to the presses and let the world know the people want these kingpins put in their place *before anything else*.\n\nOnce the government is filled with these pro-regulation representatives, regardless of what party they ascribe to, we must keep prodding those new officials to fulfill their mandate so they don't fall into the death-grip of greed.\n\nThere's obviously more to be done after this, but right now we should focus our efforts on this first, *crucial*, step to preserving our democracy, the press, and our mutual pursuit of happiness.\n\n(Edit: Grammar I doo bad)"
"end the imperial presidency ahahahahah\n\nyou mean like.. oh for example.. do stuff like closing the borders and vetting immigrants, putting america first, ending civil wars in the middle east he inherited that obama started, not joining in scam deals  with the EU that is basically international welfare under the disguise of concern for climate change, pulling out of the TPP, building a goddamn wall to separate ourselves from the mexican drug violence and illegal immigration. etc. etc. etc.\n\n\n\n\ni totally agree lets do it. let's take care of america and leave everyone else in the world to deal with their own problems.  i am 100% on board with that. (or should i say, let's keep doing it after this korea stuff blows over like it does every year for the last 20 years)\n\n\nbut in the meantime, as long as other countries are threatening nuclear strikes on a US territory or any of our allies (guam is a US territory by the way), we should probably let them know that won't go over well if they try it. i'm not sure that counts as imperialism. would you expect trump to stick  up for puerto rico if someone threatened to nuke it? what about florida? how is guam different? should we sit back and just see what happens? (we know what will happen, nothing)\n\n\n\n\nedit: i apologize for my pessimism "

'>generic leftist fear mongering'
'> Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth century, the American political system seesawed: in times of war, the presidency was dominant; in times of peace, Congress was.  \n\nThus Presidents starting wars. Almost every single President has either inherited or started his own war. Could this be one reason why they do?'
'The separation of powers that was carefully designed into the US Constitution wasn\'t just some wild and crazy 18th century idea. Even by that time, history had shown repeatedly, not over years but over centuries and millenia, that:\n\n1. The executive is the branch of government most prone to warfare and that benefits the most from it.\n\n2. The military must always remain under firm civilian control.\n\n3. It\'s hard to successfully prosecute a war by committee.\n\nSo the Constitution gave Congress the power to fund and raise an army, Congress the power to declare war, and the President the central authority to carry out a war once declared. Somehow over the years many people have misinterpreted the term "Commander in Chief" as indicating authority to launch attacks and demand loyalty from subjects. The [War Powers Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution) was meant to restrict the President\'s ability to independently launch wars, but instead Presidents have interpreted it, combined with their authority over foreign relations, as free license to start wars whenever they want, then simply "notify" Congress afterwards.\n'
'The article talks about the steps taken by Congress to curb the power of the imperial presidency in the wake of Watergate with things like the War Powers Act, and then how presidents after Nixon circumvented those moves, rendered them worthless, or just went entirely in the opposite direction, thus leaving the presidency with as much power as Trump "enjoys" today. It then has very little concrete to say about how to "dismantle" the imperial presidency other than curbing the unilateral power to start a nuclear war. What real steps could Congress take to restore the balance of power between Congress and the Presidency that would hold up to presidential attempts to circumvent them, especially given the realities of military action and America\'s place in the world today? The article offers little but platitudes. More than that, beyond ending the "thermonuclear monarchy" the only steps the last paragraph suggests are all repealing post-9/11 aspects of the imperial presidency, thus putting us back in the place we were in before 9/11 with a weakened anti-imperial-presidency infrastructure waiting for a good crisis to neuter it entirely.'
"We need to go back to when the vice president, was just whoever lost. So right now we could have Trump and Clinton. That way they're forced to compromise. Have to listen to each other, etc. But no, for some reason we decided to just send the loser home? What the fuck?"
'>What makes these words terrifying, even if we make every allowance for Trump’s bluster, is that he has the power to make them true. \n\nNo... What makes these words terrifying is that he\'s essentially saying "I dare you" to a foreign leader that\'s as equally unhinged and has the same massive ego and inferiority complex as Trump. \n\nIt\'s like school yard (or prison) tactics. NK is picking a fight with the biggest dude in the yard so everyone else thinks they\'re too crazy to screw with. The problem here is that the big dude is calling the bluff, so the crazy dude is going to have to actually follow through or look weak. Which way you think NK is going to go?'

'>institutions have proven willing to stand up to Trump, ranging from the military (which won’t carry out his ban on transgender people serving)\n\nPeople lets get one thing straight here. Tweet is not official form of communication between Administration and Military officials. \n\nTraitor In Chief never issued order to ban transgender people form military, even though his office gives him that right. Naturally that would never happened even if he does because we still have rational people with know how and funds to sue his ass from here to eternity in order to stop him. \n\nWe all need to stop falling for his random twitter rants. i know that he is a POTUS but, tweets them selfs are literarily meaningless and only purpose they serve is to distract us from things that actually matter. You know shit like searching Manafort\'s home, or subpoena for all of his financial records, or the fact that he had to hire new law firm because old one told him to go fuck him self, or maybe Trump Jr\'s "innocent" shenanigans with Russian "adoption lady", list goes on and on ...\n\nJust few days ago top fucking story on r/all was a random poll about postponing elections while on the other hand that same day we learned that subpoena was issued for all Manafort\'s finial records and that his son in law is now willingly talking to investigators too!!!\n\nPoint is that his tweets will go viral and will be covered by social media and late night comedians.

The president\'s attorney has admitted to paying this porn star. He has not received the money from Trump. He\'s *admitted* this, too. He\'s complained to friends that Trump has never paid him back, too. That\'s your *campaign finance violation*—an illegal donation to a campaign (ask John Edwards about that). Then he lied to a bank about why he needed the money to pay the porn star he admitted to paying. That\'s your *bank fraud*. If the president implicates himself on tape, he will have *also* committed a crime (campaign finance violation, but likely not the bank fraud).\n\nWhat a world.'

"Yeesh. I can handle people disliking Obama. I didn't like him all that much, policy wise. But the level of hypocrisy is intolerable. People are so willing to ignore everything about Trump, just because they either voted for him or just want a Republican in the office.\n\nMy own sister, who's husband is a slandering neocon, made the claim that if Obama got half the criticism that Trump has gotten, people would cry racism. But, the thing is, Obama was constantly lambasted for his entire 8 years. The whole Kenya thing was nothing but outright racism. The vast majority of attacks against him were little more than lies. And, to my knowledge, there was no criminal investigations into his campaign."

'Forget any of the talk about this being legal. \n\nWhat I don\'t fucking understand is how he and his sons say that there will be no new projects while Trump is in office yet they are constantly doing so.

People...what do we do? Signed: a seriously concerned citizen. '
'Fuck you ass clown.'
"Trump doesn't understand what being a public servant means. He thinks he's an autocratic ruler like Putin, and can do whatever he wants on the side. I dont even think he really knows what checks and balances are. He thought that the 3 branches of government were the Senate, the House and the Presidency.\n\nThis is why lifetime politicians can be unbearable, but are also somewhat essential. Typically, they studied ethics, civics, and even the most basic of constitutional law. Trump doesn't respect our Constitution because he doesn't understand our Constitution, and I doubt anyone in his inner circle is knowledgeable enough to correct him-let alone whether they have the balls to do so, seeing as how so many of his appointees have failed and resigned "

"It's like everything that Donald Trump touches ends up being an utter embarrassment and having disastrous consequences for people's personal life. Donald Trump is a cancer not only to people's individual lives but to this country. I have no idea how he's made it this far in life without ever facing any serious consequences for his actions. It is mind-blowing"
"the worst part is that he actually had a list of questions to prep with.\n\nHE HAD THE STUDY GUIDE. AND HE DID NOT READ IT.\n\nThe guy in his youth wasn't dumb. He want to UVA law, he works at a major law firm. How the hell has he atrophied to this point.\n\nIt's just bewildering both that he was nominated, and how poorly he prepared. "

Those positions go to *competent* lawyers and judges, not someone whose shameful performance made it seem as though they’d never opened a law book.\n\nThe entitlement issues with this guy... is that a requirement in this administration, or just a bonus?'
'“I had hoped that my nearly two decades of public service might carry more weight than my two worst minutes on television”\n\nWe are fortunate that they did not.  It\'s not a matter of whether his "nearly two decades of public service" would necessarily qualify him for the position (they famously do not), but rather how he apparently still does not recognize or refuses to acknowledge how ill prepared he is for this role.  He should never have accepted the nomination.  Every second of those "two worst minutes of television" is a product of his foolish belief that he in any way could fulfill the duties of an officer of the court.  '

'hahahaha loser don!\n\n>“There is no right and wrong for Trump, there’s winning and losing. And that’s very different from right and wrong. And right now, he’s in pure terror that he is going to lose. And by the way, he is going to lose.”\n\n- Tony Schwartz, the actual author of "The Art of the Deal"'
"Wait.  He hasn't deleted a single one of his most crazy, controversial or divisive tweets.  But he deletes these tweets.  The ones that have almost no bearing on the US population or the world in general just because the horse that he was backing didn't win.  LOL... I guess.  \n"
"Of all his deleted tweets, this gem had escaped me up until now:\n\n>Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he illegally stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong any why he got more votes than anticipated. Bad! *Date: Feb 3, '16*\n\nIs he saying that if there is a shock result in an election and the polls were all wrong, then it can only mean it's been 'stolen'? That sure is an interesting take, Donny...\n"
'“The past never had been altered. Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia.”'
'Does he not realize every tweet is screen shotted a few thousand times,  go ahead and delete Donald,  the Interwebz does not forget.  Wait,  he deletes this, but leaves the birther shit up? '
'Trump supported Moore in the primary. Any narratives to the contrary are Unpatriotic Treasonous History and will be punished as such. '
"If you look at Trump's Tweet history, it's full of lies, misogyny, hypocrisy, race-baiting and just plain stupidity. And he doesn't delete any of that. But he deletes something where he publicly backs a loser. That says everything about what's really important to Trump. "
"MSM: Strange loses primary despite Trump backing him.\n\nTRUMP: \\*deletes tweets\\* NO I DIDN'T! FAILING MEDIA LYING AGAIN!!! PATHETIC!\n\nRED HATS: CNN is FAKE NEWS!!!"
'It\'s legitimately fascinating that he doesn\'t want evidence of backing a losing candidate, but is OK with the [hundreds of tweets](https://reddit.com/r/trumpcriticizestrump) displaying his almost insane level of hypocrisy, among other unpleasant characteristics.\n\nDoes this mean "losing" really is the worst possible thing in his mind?'
"People with guts and and spine leave their bad social media posts up and admit they were wrong. They don't feebly try to weasel out and pretend it never happened."
"I remember the tweet where he specifically mention how Strange gained after Trump's endorsement. The fact that he lost shines badly at Trump. His endorsements are worthless.  "
'Don’t let his distract you from the fact that the guy who beat Strange has been fired as a judge twice and is ultra conservative. I’m not sure Alabama is better off with the new guy. '
'As an archivist, this annoys me to no ends. People keep bitching about "erasing history" in regards to removing statues, yet the President literally erases things he\'s said and where\'s the outrage?'
"I think everyone here is missing the point when they're piling on Donnie.  \n\nWhile we're trashing the president--and rightfully so--it seemed to skip everyone's mind what a completely *despicable* candidate we are getting in the Senate now. This guy holds the Bible over the Constitution. He also pledged to refuse to compromise with anyone else not a hard-liner. This country is shifting hard-right before our very eyes. This is a minor stepback for Trump and a major, major loss for the entire country "
'My favourite American political history story is from Alabama, it is the life of George Wallace, former Governor of Alabama. \n\nYou\'ll remember George Wallace as the belligerent, racist voice of the South, blocking the doors of schools and railing against the end of segregation in the name of "The Good People of Alabama."\n\nHowever, as a young lawyer, George Wallace had a remarkably progressive track record for a man of his time. But he lost his first bid for Governor in the early 1960s because he hedged on the race issue.\n\nWhen he ran in the next election he was determined to not make the same mistake. He came out hard on the race issue, aggressively in favour of segregation and against the civil rights movement. He railed against the forced integration of schools by the federal government. And he won the election in a landslide.\n\nGeorge Wallace kept winning elections as Governor of Alabama for two decades straight.\n\nBut he wasn\'t the belligerent racist voice of the South that he became famous for in the 1960s for his full two decades as Governor. Even while spouting these racist words on national tv he began opening up opportunities for black people in Alabama. This only accelerated throughout his time as Governor.  \n\nBy end of his tenure he was opening up jobs, housing, opportunities and affirmative action programs for black people in Alabama at a rate that far exceeded anything being done in the Northern States or even by the Federal government.\n\nAnd when he ran for Governor for the last time in the 1980s George Wallace, that belligerent, racist voice of the South, that former nemesis of Martin Luther King, was elected with a landslide that included an astonishing 90% of the black vote.\n\nGeorge Wallace spent the last years of his life desperately trying to explain away his racist past to all who would listen.\n\nGeorge Wallace died in 1997, and if there is a Hell he is there now. Not because of his racist past, no, his late life quest for redemption pioneered many programs that were a template for helping black communities around the country that genuinely helped lift millions out of poverty..\n\nNo, George Wallace is in Hell now because he callously chose to see an entire people be downtrodden to further his personal thirst for power.'
"Just more evidence of Trump's complete inability to lose with grace/take a hit/ acknowledge that things didn't work out the way he wanted them to/etc.\n\nIt's quite unbecoming."
"This won't help the McConnell and Trump relationship.  Trump is pissed that Mitch had him endorse a loser and McConnell has to accept the fact that Trump is becoming a liability for the GOP establishment."

'Somehow, with all the questionable decisions, quotes, and actions from our current administration; the one he made yesterday strikes closest to me. \n\nI don’t care what side of the aisle you fall on politically. It honestly shouldn’t apply on this topic - because this transcends political parties. If President Trump removes DACA, over 1.5 million tax-paying, otherwise legal residents of the United States will be subjected to immediate arrest and deportation. Why? Because they committed the heinous crime of being brought to America as children. Go find someone in your neighborhood that is here by virtue of being a DACA recipient and tell them that his/her life deserves to be upheaved and thrust into overnight uncertainty because of our presidents political pandering. Tell local business owners, tax paying employees, and your neighbors that because they were brought to the US by their parents when they were 5 years old that they don’t deserve to be here and should be arrested thanks to a hot-headed President who is hellbent NOT on good governing, but on reversing any legislation that has any semblance of President Obama’s fingerprints on it.

I don't blame them nor hate them, they must have had their reasons for bringing me here, I just wished they had done it the right way.\n\nLife before DACA was rough, I worked at a shitty job getting paid $8hr with no future nor goal in life, living from paycheck to paycheck, I did however pay taxes using a ITIN number given by the IRS.\n\nAfter DACA was introduced I was able to get a better paying job, that paid 35k, I then started community college for 2 years, while I worked and went to college full time, after community college I transfered to a state university which meant tution cost would increase, so I needed to land a higher paying job, which I did. I got job at a fortune 100 company, in corporate america at around 55k, with this new income I was able and I am still able to continue my education. I am a senior in college, pursuing a bachelors in Accounting with a minor in Information System, I have a 3.6GPA, I work full time in the mornings and go to college at nights, I have no criminal record whatsoever, I have never been arrested, I have a credit score of 740, no loans, no debt, no financial aid (I don't qualify as a DACA recipient) I have paid for everything out of pocket.\n\nI feel myself American, I was raised here, my loyalty and allegiance lies here. I am dissapointed, heartbroken, and worried about the future I just thought, if I did everything right and stay out of trouble, they'd accept me and let me stay. No matter where I end up, I will always hold and see America as my home, and I will do everything in my power to return home."
"I guess we're not counting any presidents before like, 1975, huh? Japanese people weren't too pleased about the camp system we setup for them, as I recall. Why do people insist on this sort of hyperbole? I don't like him ending DACA much either, but it is *very* far from 'one of the cruelest decisions ever made by a president'."

I don't hear Sanders complaining about how Mexico won't even allow non-citizens or immigrants to serve in it's military. I don't hear Sanders or any of you lot complaining about Japans strict immigration policies. You can't just immigrate to Canada, Mexico, Japan without proving you can support yourself.\n\nWhy does the US have to have the most lax immigration but every other country escapes your false outrage? Oh right, you don't care about actual immigration, you're still mad that Trump is President."

These are people we have invested in through education. They are a benefit to our economy. \n\nFrom a practical perspective, eliminating DACA is just stupid. There are Dreamers here who barely speak Spanish or don't speak it at all. There are Dreamers who don't even know exactly where they're from. \n\nI have a good friend who is a Dreamer. He was brought to the US at age 4. His parents are deceased and all his siblings are younger and US citizens (they were born here). He is married, has 3 kids with his American wife. He's a law-abiding, tax paying citizen, a parent, a member of our community. He barely speaks Spanish. And kicker: he doesn't even know what fucking town in Mexico he's from. Where exactly would they send him? Hell, he could claim he doesn't even know if he's from Mexico or somewhere else. He has zero documentation. What the fuck is he supposed to do?"
"It's his MO to make ugly and cruel decisions. If it's a social program designed to help *anyone,* he wants to cut it. There is no reason whatsoever to end this, and the financial burden on the government is nil compared to the return in adding to the workforce. "
"Why should we punish innocent people for the sins of their ancestors?  They didn't do anything wrong.  They didn't choose to commit any illegal act or break human code.  Why should they be punished?\n\nNow swap out DACA kid with the descendants of slave owners.  If you feel the same for each scenario, you are legitimately concerned about this topic.  If you see a difference, than you are politically agenda driven.  Simple exercise."
"I'd argue that congress not fixing long ago is the cruel part.   Now they have 6 months to do something, otherwise I blame them.\n\nThis is a negotiation tactic to get comprehensive reform, and probably money for the wall."

'Of course he can’t handle Avenatti. Public in-person confrontations terrify him hence the infamous manner in which he fled Ivana in fear after the infamous Aspen blowup where she and Marla had a public fight. Unfortunately for him Ivana was a professional  level skier so she caught up to him and witnesses swear she skied past him backwards wagging her finger at him. If heaven exists I will be immediately asking God to roll that footage for me.\n\nTrump might beat the hell out of a woman behind closed doors and is a keyboard bully but a genuine public confrontation with someone like Avenatti is something he would never do because he knows he would lose BIGLY.'

It didn’t elaborate, but the Ohio-based hospital was already under pressure to shift venues.\n\n>Doctors, nurses and medical students of the hospital had signed a public letter earlier this year objecting to Mar-a-Lago given President Trump’s plans to cut funding of medical research and other policies.\n\n>**The Cleveland Clinic has held its annual fundraiser at the resort for eight years.**\n\n&nbsp;\n>A few hours after the hospital pulled out, the American Cancer Society said it also planned to shift the venue of its annual fundraiser, called the 2018 Island of Palm Beach gala.\n\n>“Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community,” spokeswoman Miriam Falco said in statement. **“It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations.”**\n\n>Falco declined to elaborate.\n\n&nbsp;\n>Late Thursday, the American Friends of Magen David Adom announced it had decided not to hold its 2018 fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago. **The group, which raises money for an ambulance service in Israel, has been holding its annual gala at the resort since 2012.**\n\n>Its spokesman, Erik Levis, gave no reason but said the decision came after “considerable deliberation.” His statement noted the organization is “apolitical.”\n\n'
'**The Palm Beach Police Department apparently takes lying lessons.  From whom, I cannot be sure.**\n\n> The Palm Beach Police Foundation said in a statement that it plans to keep its annual ball at Mar-a-Lago because it is not a political event and no other venues in town can accommodate 700 guests.\n\nThe [Palm Beach County Convention Center](http://www.pbconventioncenter.com/aboutpbccc/)\'s "facility guide" mentions:\n\n> **Meeting Room and Ballroom Specifications**\n\n>For smaller gatherings, the PBCCC has multi-function rooms throughout the complex offering the versatility to accommodate 10 to over 2,000 people. The ballroom has approximately 22,000 sq. ft. of column-free space and may be divided into four smaller sections or multiple combinations for smaller functions. "'
'John Oliver voice: "*Cool*."\n\nAfter all the reporting of 2016 showing how much of a scam Mar-a-Lago was and how toxic it *already was*, I don\'t give a ton of credit to the companies bowing out now. And interesting parallel though:\n\nWhen the NC bathroom bill was a big deal, Trump came out "against" it. That\'s part of where the "Trump is secretly pro-lgbt" line comes from. But his statement at the time had a qualifier that most people ignored. He said NC was foolish to push for the bill because of how much tourism business they lost via the boycott. He didn\'t say it was a bad bill or a discriminatory bill, etc etc. He said it was bad because of the cost to the state the backlash incurred. (As in, if there was no boycott, he wouldn\'t have had a problem with the bill, or wouldn\'t have spoken out about it.)\n\nTrump shouldn\'t have got credit then, and these companies don\'t get much credit now. The interesting thing tying these two together though, is that Trump is a walking NC bathroom bill now, and by his own campaign rhetoric, he should be calling himself foolish for pushing the white nationalist stuff and incurring a boycott of his property.'
"It's probably because Mar-a-Lago is a dump with fake Time Magazine covers on display."
'Trump is an absolute psychopath. Additionally, he is a racist scumbag. Underneath it all are more layers of an even longer and more despicable shitshow. '
"It's really fucked up when people can get back at the President by affecting his pocket book. \n\nWelcome to Alice-In-The-United-States"
"These are the kinds of actions we need. \n\nTrump is in a terrible Catch 22 right now. He probably doesn't want to be President, but he can't quit because he loses his power to pardon, and he would be leaving in disgrace. "
"I think probably of all the things that have made Trump mad over the last few months (low polling numbers, inability to get anything passed in congress, etc...), this one will be what really makes him angry.  This one is affecting his businesses and his income and that is pretty much all he cares about.  I can't wait to see him complaining about the American Cancer Society, people who activity try to prevent others from dying of cancer."
'So, if Trump complains about this at all, is he violating the emoluments clause...?'
'"The America Cancer society is fake charity guys, totally fake. Cancer is very agressive we all know, i know. I know a lot. But chemo is also very agressive. Agression from many sides, many sides"'
"I think Trump's political capital has finally run dry. He failed nationally to promote any legislative agenda. He made things worse with NK, potentially threatening the US. He failed to condemn white supremacists and neo-nazis. Like, come on, how much damage can this guy inflict before the GOP does something?"
"One thing that's been scary since day 1 is the fact that any attack on any of the Trump properties worldwide would mean an attack on America.\n\nSecurity has gotta be lax at some of his international bullshit properties, and any small grievance (like a few ISIS dudes charging into the lobby with guns) would turn into a big fucking reaction. Nobody was afraid of Jimmy Carter's peanut farm."
'The whole notion of the existence of "charities" fundraising at a place like Mar-a-Lago symbolizes much of what\'s wrong with the US, regardless of the existence of Trump.\n\nAnd I don\'t believe the two are not connected. Both are the result of a lack of proper public services despite being the wealthiest nation ever, starting with education.'
'But but but, you guys are just misinterpreting his statements!  Fake news!  SAD!  '
'My question is, why the FUCK were these events planned there in the first place? '

'So if anybody is having trouble keeping up with this (as I am), here\'s a short and sweet breakdown -- please correct me if I\'m wrong:\n\nThe biggest issue with this Stormy-Daniels saga is not, in and of itself, Trump having an affair.  As wrong as it is, affairs and those up the financial ladder are nothing new.  *Still super disgusting, though. \n\nHere, Trump\'s campaign is being accused of using campaign funds for quashing a potential leak from Daniels about an affair with Trump.  Cohen (Trump\'s lawyer) does not deny that money was used to keep her quiet, but insists that every dollar came from private "out-of-pocket" sources with (and this is important) NO orders or knowledge by Trump or his campaign.  Unethical, but not a violation of campaign rules (at least in the same way that money going directly from Trump to Cohen to Daniels would be).  \n\nThis new story adds the hook that Cohen used a Trump company email to settle things with Daniels.  This may indicate that Trump (a) had more knowledge of the settlement than previously stated and/or (b) that Trump funds supposed to be used for the campaign were used in the settlement. \n'
"It's literally stupid Watergate. I can't begin to fathom how much damage these people would do if they were actually competent."
"If Obama had pulled a stunt like this, Fox News would lose their shit completely.\n\nTrump does it, and it's  crickets.\n\nMeanwhile, he is eroding our global position,  negating our soft power,  and punishing staunch allies with his stupid tariffs.\n\nHe needs to go.  He is an incompetent fool."
"Just remember everyone, when the FSB sent hookers to Trump's hotel room all we have is his word that he sent them away.  The word of a marriage oath breaker, who has a history of lying and fucked a porn star while his wife was pregnant "

'I have the worst f*cking attorneys.'

"If the lawyer paid off Stormy Daniels himself, and didnt report that as a campaign contribution, then he is guilty of a crime. If he paid off Stormy Daniels to hide the fact that Trump was paying her off, which Trump was not going to report as a campaign contribution, then accomplice liability and conspiracy to Trump's crime. In addition, we have a lawyer here, so even if there is not enough evidence to prove a crime, there is a possibility of ethical improprieties which should be considered by the attorney's bar association."
'"you using email in a fucking criminal conspiracy, to pay off a porn star"'
"lmao he's fucked and if he used a private email server like trunp.org he would be guilty exactly luke Hillary oh wait he did bahahah republicans just got fucked raw dog anal on this one jajajajaja "
"Real talk: did Trump pay for the sex too? Not just hush money. I'm asking did he pay for prostitution? Is that still illegal in the US? So... Lock Her Up! "
"Just throw it into the pile for Mueller at this point.\n\nCollusion and possible treason are the big things he is swinging for. But illegal campaign donations? That's a little lower on the pile of, hopefully, MULTIPLE charges he is bringing to this crowd of idiots.\n\nIt is absolutely incredible no one in this group thought they would get caught. Even if Trump didn't want to win he couldn't hide all of this shit forever."
'It’s just a coincidence. Doesn’t mean anything!!1! Trump denies any involvement! #butheremails'

'Are they going to address the fact that Yates was fired for not implementing the ban due to it being illegal? Turns out she was right all along and dismissed unfairly.'
"so how many times has 9th circuit wasted time and money blocking this ban to have it repealed by the supreme court because there's legit no legal basis for the ban not to take place?"
'Hah! No shit.\n\nI can see it now...\n\n“Appeals court rules that Trump’s 28th travel ban is illegal” '
"But guys, Trump needs the 120 days because we're in terrible danger otherwise! /s"
'If I punched a person in the face, I would be sent to jail for assault. If I punched a second, and then a third person in the face, I would face stiffer penalties. I would also be required to pursue behavioral therapy. \n  \nPlease explain how Trump can repeatedly break the law in the exact same way, be informed that he has broken the law, and do it again, and not only face no penalties for his behavior, but retain his position as POTUS. The man is adversely affecting the lives of thousands of people who have done nothing wrong.'
'Trump sucks ass at this politics thing.'
'How does that saying go?  "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result."  Yep, Trump is insane.  But we knew that.'
"Our court systems has been a source of sanity. Trump's insistence on packing the court with more on conservatives, instead of intelligent and principled conservatives, undermines this. Far left conservative celebrate, but they will come to regret putting absolute morons in power, who then appoint absolutely moronic judges."
'keeps trying to do illegal shit, is still president'
'Why is the travel ban so bad in the first place?'
'I"m absolutely flabbergasted at the laws being broken by these people and that you are supporting them.  \n\nYou can\'t declare it illegal by simply saying it is. His original ban wasn\'t illegal to begin with, the people obstructing this ARE breaking the law but since there are so many idiots behind them they don\'t fear retribution as long as they keep lying.'
">The court issued a limited injunction blocking the ban as it applies to “foreign nationals who have a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.”\n\nAnyone who isn't a lawyer and is partying because Trump has lost has no idea what this fucking means.\nIf the paper is citing the decision correctly isn't saying anything new, lads. It only means the ban doesn't apply to these foreigners with bona fide relationships. \nApart from that the ban is in full effect, I don't even know why are you celebrating the ban is still in effect by all means.

"(D): Hey I shot myself in the foot, and goddam it hurts. Now it's your turn.\n\n\n(R) Nah, I'd rather not."
"No one would believe Trump would resign.\n\nFurther, everyone can see this, and should assume this is a waste of time. I can't see how calling for Trump's resignation, and Trump refusing (or ignoring) would change anyone's mind, after all that's happened so far.\n\nI guess it's supporting democrat fundraising. But I'm surprised that any election spending at all would advantage Trump (or disadvantage a democrat) over, well, anyone else I'd expect to run against him. \n\nAlso, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe saying nothing would benefit Tump. And that blows my mind.\n"
"And he won't. So Franken being pressured to resign was the dumbest thing Dems could have done. This is why we always lose."
'So no Republicans and 3 Dems, well that was certainly worth backstabbing Franken for...fucking spineless Dems.\n\nWhere the hell is the call from Gillibrand or Klobuchar, come on you self righteous clowns, you didn\'t hesitate to jump on the "fuck Franken" bangwagon, where are your coward spineless asses on this one?'
'It is so bewildering to me that recently so many men have had their careers ended by allegations of sexual misconduct, and yet the one man that was actually caught on tape admitting to sexual assault is getting a pass.  Trump is held to an unbelievably lower standard.  '
"How the fuck do they get like 20+ senators to call for Franken's resignation and only three for Trump??  And ZERO for Blake Farenthold!  What is wrong with these sorry fucks?"
"This had to be the dumbest plan ever by the Democrats. They thought making Franken resign was going to make them pillars of morality? No. All it did was make a really good Senator who actually fought for people step down. Now we get a placeholder who likely doesn't want to be there. "
"The dems are so bad at politics. This is something you'd expect naive high schoolers to do. Forcing Franken out not only doesn't give dems the moral high ground (which they already had anyways), it is communicating, politically, that what Franken did was worse than what Trump and Moore have done. Even to dems' own base, they've effectively equated what Franken did to what others (think Weinstein, Moore, etc.) have done, which is absurd."
'Gee, didn’t see that one coming.  All this build up was almost obviously meant to target the POTUS.  It’s unfortunate for the Dems who had to resign as bait for the big fish.  No one should have to resign due to “allegations,” unless they admit to wrongdoing.'
"Fucking dumbass liberals are happy to empty all of their seats for the sake of the moral high ground while Republicans just exploit it.  we won't have healthcare or an environment left but at least one guy is punished for some stupid joke decades ago despite being a proponent for women his entire political career."
'And he is not going to. And the moral high ground is not going to matter and the democrats will never be thought of as being more family oriented than republicans and democrats will never be seen as more patriotic than republicans and democrats will continue to find ways to shoot themselves in the foot and lose races.\n\nThe most pathetic party evar!\n'
"Can we stop politicizing the #metoo movement to get trump to resign? He's not going to; he doesn't have the character. Trying to make it happen is just going to make you seem naively arrogant. "
'Fellow Democrats: our efforts are far more worthwhile being spent on your local Congressional candidate\'s election in 2018. The extreme right faction of the GOP will not behave like Al Franken or John Conyers. Their mantra is "deny and counterattack". Absurdity, accountability, and irony are lost on their constituents. It\'s "anything but a liberal" and they\'ve shown it.  The battle is for the independent voters and getting the youth vote to the polls in 2018 and after.\n\nImpeachment motions and demands to resign  will fall on deaf ears until the Democrats control both houses of Congress.'
'Why do people hate trump so much? Like holy hell everyone that talks bad about him only brings up stuff like "he\'s a child", "he\'s an idiot" that trash can be said about anyone you disagree with.'
'The same accusation that made Franken resign, Trump is accused of the very next day and none of the outraged republican senators that asked Franken to resign say a word... fuck this fucking hypocritical shitstorm.'
'The Democrats showing gross incompetence and eagerly killing a progressive in am utterly futile play I am shocked, shocked I say '
"Trump will **never** resign. If we want to get rid of him he's going to have to be dragged from the White House in cuffs, kicking and screaming the entire way as he desperately grabs on to doorframes."
"Trump would have to think he did something wrong before he'd even consider about thinking of resigning. "

'Joe Scarborough was just lamenting that these “poor kids” (referring to Nunberg and Hicks) but also including Flynn have these legal fees to pay. Poor fucking kids?

"It's almost as if Trump wanted to become president just to get himself a tax cut - and to spite Obama."
"I am all for the anti-trump pity party that Reddit loves so much, but this is a British tabloid article that does nothing to support the headline. It is clickbait sensationalism. This issue is already shitty enough, we don't need to make up more shit to be upset about."
'He has always wanted to get the Corporate Tax down to be competitive, and in fact wanted it at 15%.  Not exactly a secret unless you have your head up your butt! It was always a huge priority. He also wanted a middle class tax cut, which he would not give up on. This headline is pure BS, and deceptive. It explains why he declares "fake news" all the time. This is very misleading.  \n\nI think the media has lost all objectivity. '
"There's so much bullshit in everything Trump says. He said we had the highest corporate tax rate here. Total bullshit. We were already a tax shelter compared to most modern nations. Now we're dipping into the levels of 3rd world kleptocrat states."
"Are you still trying to sell the idea that this isn't a middle class tax cut?  You do realize that's not going to work in about a month when people start seeing bigger paychecks, right?  Lying about a bill only works if it *doesn't* pass.  You're basically just gauranteeing that voters are going to stop trusting Democrats and the liberal media."
'When reddit posts articles like this, I can’t really take it seriously. It loses credibility. Taking a quote and then extrapolating a misleading headline. This is why the term fake news gets thrown around. It was never a secret that corporate taxes were going to go down.  '
'Can somebody just make it stop? Can we just cry, "Mercy" and get a new president? How many times can someone and his cronies fuck over his constituents and be allowed to keep doing it?'
'WHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTT?! Trump and the GOP lied? I for one am shocked and appalled! This regime has never done this before and I for one had full faith in them to do the right thing because they said they would that one time. (/s)'
"So let's look at something specific. Repealing the insurance mandate. Won't we dramatically cause the health care system to be erratic by depriving them the mandate? Someone's gotta have the numbers, how much annually does the mandate generate monetarily that the Heath care system receives? Just think, when companies lose money they raise prices, premiums and deductibles will literally go up quickly. I can imagine some people in that sector are freaking out because this could also mean job loses, right?"
'At a certain point I’m starting to question why I should even live in this trash ass country anymore. What fucking benefits make living in this country worthwhile? Is it the tens of thousands of dollars of debt i’m in from going to college, is it the thousands of dollars of debt i’m in from medical insurance, is it the lack of decent paying jobs, or is it the blatant favoritism for the uber-wealthy that our government has. I’m just fucking fed up. Half the country can’t be bothered to have very basic empathy for one another until they’ve been affected by a problem.'

"If propaganda attacks are on par with 9/11, we are declaring war on almost every country on earth.  I mean, I hate that Trump is President, and hope the Dems can reverse things in '18 and '20, but at some point too much hyperbole is ineffective.\n"

'>That’s roughly where we stand after the second-worst foreign attack on America in the past two decades. The Russian subversion of the 2016 election did not, to be sure, kill nearly 3,000 people. But its longer-term impact may be even more corrosive by undermining faith in our democracy.\n\nWow.  They are comparing the deaths of 3000 people to Russia attempting - and ultimately failing - to interfere with the 2016 election.  Could you be suffering from any greater form of Trump Derangement Syndrome?'
'what complete dishonest fear mongering. The Washingtonpost has lost its mind. So far the investigation has determined that these twitter trolls and russians had no material affect on the election at all. The money spent was like 1/5000th of a percent of what the candidates spent. The "worst attack since 9/11" my ass.'
'what fucking garbage. russia sponsoring some trolls online is now fucking equal to or somehow WORSE than the pulse shooting? or las vegas? what the fuck.  \n\nyou people have lost your goddamn minds. '
"I'm sorry, it is beyond insulting to suggest that 13 Russians on laptops come anywhere near 9/11z they have no business being in the same sentence together."
'The scary part is that I\'m not even sure what "attack" you\'re referring to just by reading the title'
'Calling some Russians trolling around on the internet "The worst attack on America since 9/11" is an insult to the hundreds that have died from ISIS\' terrorists attacks.\n\nTrump won fair and square, just accept it. It\'s not like voting machines hacked, people from other countries just happened to dick around on the internet and influence people\'s choices. Who cares.'
'Whoever wrote this should be fired. This isn’t journalism. It’s almost as bad as what the author is accusing Russia of. Talk about propaganda and sowing discontent. \n\nThe last paragraph is absolute horse shit. '
'Just image how apeshit the Republican Party would be going right now, if it was President Hillary Rodham Clinton wilfully ignoring the Russian meanace and crowing about "no collusion".\n\n Shouts of "Treasonous bitch!" and serial congressional motions to impeach would be echoing from one corner of the nation to the other. '
'Fuck this shit post.'
"I'll play devil's advocate,\n\n• Fort Hood\n\n\n• Boston Marathon\n\n\n• Orlando nightclub \n\n• The truck massacre in New York last October \n\n\nRegardless, I don't know how y'all want to rank these. But if you're trying to tell me that out of all those and 9/11, this Russian hack ranks as the next worst foreign attack against the United States? I'm not sure how well known it is to the general population, but the United States is attacked almost on a daily basis by adversaries on the internet. It's why we have specific cyber career fields in the Air Force to fight these attacks. This is nothing compared to what China and other nations are capable of. Modern wars are no longer fought at the tip of a bayonet, but at the click of a keyboard. \n\nI'll see y'all in the controversial tab in a bit!"
'Article starts out with this:\n\n"Imagine if, after 9/11, ... we did not create a Transportation Security Administration and a Department of Homeland Security... If we did not pass a USA Patriot Act to enhance surveillance.\xa0"\n\nThe author of using there things as the best reaction to the attacks. As if to not do these things would be bad. But I dunno. Maybe we would have been off, as a nation, without them.'
'this thread is absolutely batshit.  this russia stuff is turning liberals fucking just as crazy as birthers during the obama years.  worst attack since 9/11?  some fucking facebook trolls?  you psychos realize 17 kids had their brains blown out last week, right?'
'This is such a ridiculous and inane article. In the opening paragraphs this guy praises the Patriot Act and implies that Russian influence in the election will be "more corrosive" than the effects of 9/11. Without even addressing the obvious fact that 3000 people were killed in those attacks and zero as a result of Russia\'s actions, here\'s a brief list of the horrific consequences brought about as a direct result of 9/11:\n\n-Immediately following the attacks, Rumsfeld began planning to use them as justification for invading Iraq.\n\n-The immediate response to the attacks was for us to conduct a full-scale invasion of Afghanistan, a country without a centralized government that bin Laden wasn\'t even from and which was therefore incapable of "protecting" him. We killed thousands of innocent civilians and created armies of new "terrorists" who took up arms against a foreign invader as anyone would, especially after that invader destroyed so much of the country and killed so many innocents, and the war didn\'t even lead to bin Laden\'s capture. He was found using military intelligence and apprehended by a small strike force in Pakistan, a strategy that would have been much more effective from the beginning.\n\n-With the start of the Afghanistan war, the US government and the defense contractors--who "contribute" massively to all members of congress and all presidents regardless of party--got what they so long desired: endless war, justified to this day using the Authorization for the Use of Military Force passed immediately following the attacks, of course written with intentionally vague and broad language to allow the US to attack and invade anywhere in the world where there was anyone they could claim as connected to the 9/11 attacks.\n\n--And clearly, they brought us the Patriot Act and subsequent legislation like the NDAA which strip the rights of even American citizens to a speedy trial, permit indefinite detention without charge, and eliminate any semblance of digital privacy.\n\nThis "journalist" might want to reevaluate his profession, or at the very least be forthright about the fact that he is a blatant propagandist for the war machine.'
'in many ways, you could argue that this is worse than 9/11'
"Russian money laundering isn't 9/11. This is dangerously irresponsible hyperbole. We must fight Trump with TRUTH not bills hit benghazi esque partisan hackery."
'Trump *is* the worst attack on America since 9/11'
'An interesting point is that 9/11 was an obvious attack from a secret target and the election was a secret attack from an obvious target. \n\nThe scary thing is that Russia basically declared war on us and now the ball is in our court. '
'Trump is the chief beneficiary of the worst attack on America since 9/11'
'$1m in Facebook ads? Worst attack since 9/11? 😂😂'
'Think I am finally burnt out on these shameful guttersnipe attacks against Donald Trump. You would think the guy would wither away and end it all. \n\nNot Trump. He can withstand the fakest, cruelest, most childish attacks ever seen on earth and bounce back, in victory, with his twitter account, and 60  million people backing him up.'
'The administration is a mess. Incompetence all around. No wonder Americans hate this clown.'
'This is actually quite offensive to the 3,000 people that died on 9/11. WaPo should be ashamed of themselves for publishing this. How could they possibly think this was anywhere near as bad as 9/11?'
"Fuck these clickbaity titles, just fucking tell me. It makes it seem like there was a terrorist attack on american soil where hundreds of people lost their lives today or some shit. I didn't even click it because I don't contribute to clickbait but I'm assuming from the comments it's about russia's influence on american politics."
"Because he's the worst leader this country has had."
"This is a bit heavy with the hyperbole. \n\nWhat Russia did is fucked up and we should do everything we can to prevent it from happening in the future, but in reality it was nothing but an advanced propgoanda campaign. Propoganda is nothing new. If we, as a country, weren't so stupid, it wouldn't have even been a problem. \n\nI would argue the people who masterminded the citizens united ruling have done, and will do, far more damage to American democracy than the 2016 Russian propaganda campaign ever could.

'When I called my father to tell him this, he still fought me. I said that we might *know* people that are being detained, family friends, but he insisted that all of the "chatter" might not be true. This is how it happened it Poland. People refused to acknowledge the truth because it was too horrible, so they decided that the lie the state-media and people in power was shilling out was more preferable, because even considering the alternative meant that you had to take ownership of that knowledge. You either did something or you didn\'t, and doing something means that we leave the comfort of our lives to face something that is innately corrupt.\n\nThis has been...overwhelming to say the least. I honestly am past the point of feeling dismay. It makes me nervous to know that I have family and friends that could be targeted by this inhumane crackdown on people who are just trying to live their lives. Someone argued with me that the detention centers aren\'t internment camps. I don\'t know. I find it hard to argue this anymore, because by arguing it we make it into a "point of debate". There isn\'t any debate here. There isn\'t any "your side" "my side". This is wrong. History has shown us what policies like this are, and beyond being the direct result of racist and extremist ideologies allowed to become the norm, and we allowed this by making this asinine ideologies (tribalism, eugenics, theories like the "bell curve", etc) to exist and propagate. (And for those skeptics, seriously, eugenics, that crazy old debunked field of science. A alt-righter mentioned it while debating a streamer I like, yea...bringing back the golden oldies.)\n\nKids are being separated from their parents and we let this happen.

"To all those who don't understand the purpose of this:\n\nNow the narrative will shift towards the left and the media calling Trump a Nazi, calling him a fascist, instead of them talking about the alt right. If the heat is directed towards Trump, then the entire Republican base will likely ignore it as another Democrat attack. Theyve already been inoculated towards anything that is said about Trump. What was doing real damage however was going after the alt right, which most republicans do not fully understand and are wary of. If the media changes to go after Trump they'll ignore the whole story instead of breaking up the Republican factions even further.\n\nAs a bonus, this is a wink by Trump to his Nazi fans. But if the media decides to center their efforts on blaming this on Trump, it will fail. They need to be going after targets that the Republican voterbase won't defend.\n"
'Goddamn I fucking hate this man.\n\nTweeting a picture of a train running over someone with "CNN" written on them.  After someone was ran over and killed at an anti-nazi rally.\n\nHe\'s an embarrassment.'
"i keep on seeing these dumb post on r/politics that has nothing to do with actual politics. It's all just bias bullshit used to get upvotes. "
"Here's something I've realized. Those who are heavily influenced by the media and spend most of their time watching, reading, and caring what the media has to say, are the ones posting, hating, and discussing all the petty things that happen. \n\nLike this retweet for example. Who the FUCK cares?? This is what your life has become now? You're fighting over a fucking retweet that was accidental, and then deleted? \n\nReddit... you suck big ol donkey dick now. What happened?"
"At this point, the Onion writers have got to be on suicide watch.  They can't even come close to reality."
'Trump drones his way through a statement that fascists interpret as approval for running over people. After days of public pressure, he reluctantly scolds the white supremacists. As a sneaky wink to show he didn\'t mean it, he retweets a right-wing conspiracy nutjob. Then he decides that might be a bit too subtle, so he retweets that he\'s a fascist. \n\nI wouldn\'t bet anything I care about on this story being true, but it\'s how the last few days of Trump reads for me. But I\'m genuinely struggling to think of anything less sinister. "My finger slipped multiple times". \n\nEven if I\'m not right though, this just further cements his stupidity and incompetence. Anyone who has even glanced at politics should know how things like this read, yet Trump incessantly does things that make him look like a villain. \n\nTo make matters worse, I don\'t feel comfortable giving him the benefit of the doubt. All through his campaign were cries of "he didn\'t really mean that completely stupid thing he just said". \n\nBut it turns out he *did* mean those things. Does he mean these things too?'

'It wasn\'t even an hour before he got in a fight with CNN after saying that fascism is evil in a "press conference".\n\nThe thing that ticked me off the most yesterday was Fox News showing the speech and then saying how wonderful it was, and that anyone who disapproved of how he handled the situation was "unamerican" (to quote their words).'
'He also retweeted an image of a train running over CNN/a CNN reporter. Just days after the woman was run over during the Nazi rally.\n\nNot immediately disavowing supremacists, retweeting this garbage and endorsing violence against media - purely out of the Bannon Nazi Playbook.\n\nFuck this entire administration, fuck its president, fuck its lowly toads that run the joint.'
"Most trump supporters are not alt right or kkk, but that's not the point. The rank and file, and trump, were willing to tolerate them instead of singling them out and repudiating them, for the votes. It was an unspoken deal with the devil, ans now the devil is coming for his (perceived) due. Even now trump could drive them out but he isn't, so the racists are going to keep pushing and the unrest is going to get worse. This is an infection and if he doesn't get off his ass and be a leader, it's going to draw more people in and take on a life of its own. Be a leader, trump. And if you voted for trump, stand up and require him to ditch the alt right."
'This and the CNN train tweet shows how pretty inept he is about his digital life.\n\nBut come on guys, this is not something that should replace his racist antics. [Him retweeting views of Jack Posibiec] (http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-updates-everything-president-trump-retweets-alt-right-blogger-who-1502769297-htmlstory.html) is more troublesome and continues the narrative he is a alt-right loving racist moron.'

"It's definitely because of Obama roasting him at the WH Correspondent Dinner that year, but it's also racism and also Trump's feeling that Obama is everything he is not: self made, Harvard lawyer, intelligent and classy, never divorced, never cheated, beloved by many, a successful POTUS. Basically Obama is everything Trump never was and never will be. At his core I think Trump knows he is stupid, in over his head, and a loser"

You\'ve elected the village idiot to the presidency.'
'See this is what kind of gives me solace about Trumps presidency. It\'s pretty generally accepted that Trump wanted to be president to show up Obama, because he\'s an incredibly vengeful person. And while on the surface it appears to have worked against all odds, at the end of the day, he\'s ruined the "Trump" brand that he\'s spent his entire life trying to build up. By the end of his presidency, he\'s probably going to destroy his personal image, and he\'s going to make the brand toxic for his kids.  \n\nIn his quest for vengeance against Obama, he\'ll likely alienate himself from his own city and a lot of his friends, destroy his reputation, expose himself as a moron, and leave a permanent black mark on his kid\'s future.

"That's not a surprise. Russia can't beat us militarily. They're behind by far too much, only have one aircraft carrier which leaks and gets tugged around, and have no hope of catching up.\n\nBest way to ruin America? Trigger conservatives enough to make them monkey-out at the polls and elect the host of **The Apprentice**, who ends up acting like... the host of The Apprentice. Watch as Republicans erode the country from the inside out through lies, cheating, corruption, and scandals and erase a century of progress and alliances. \n\nRussians have effectively turned conservatives against their own country and made them turn American values upside-down. All for the cost of paying Russian trolls $20/week to make dank memes."

'No wonder Hannity sounded so desperate and worried today.'
"In the end it doesn't much matter as Trump is so crooked, he's going to force his own shell of a party to impeach him. \n\nHe was a money launderer and fraud for organized crime long before he took office, and his entire business empire is a sham. \n\nYou can argue about this instance or that, but overall there's just no denying his fundamental corruption. There may be no justice in this world, but if there is any, Trump's going to end up in jail and everyone's going to wonder what the hell is wrong with the people who supported him."
'I think a lot of people are misreading this a bit.\n\nIt says that Putin wanted to help Trump to hurt Clinton. Not help Trump only, but to specifically hurt Clinton. Nor does it say there was collusion. Just that Putin wanted to hurt Clinton and if helping ANYBODY else hurt Clinton Putin wanted that.\n\nThe other information that came out this morning goes along the same path - Putin wanted to hurt Clinton and if by helping someone else he hurt her chances he was all for it.\n\nI think that is born out when the troll farm activities are looked at - the majority of the ads purchased were for things like BLM which hurt Clinton. I mean the troll farm ads that painted the GOP as the KKK could hardly have been helpful to Trump.'
"The US House is really just a massive and childish shit show. Guess that's what happens when you ultimately have to appeal to a much smaller crowd of voters."
'Trumpism has infected our political discourse to such a nauseating degree that Putin’s patently obvious preference for Trump over Clinton—and not for benevolent, “peace-loving” reasons—is *still* rejected by a noisy fringe.  The House GOP “report” was such an obviously hyperpartisan, Trump-enabling hack job that only Cult45 and Trump’s craven toadies on “Fox & Friends” were deluded/shameless enough to spin it as remotely factual. \n\nIt will be interesting to see if the the GOP senators who signed off on this report show backbones in the face of an inevitable, furious backlash by their Cult45 constituents—and, of course, Trump himself. \n\nSo many times in the last two years, otherwise  rational, decent Republicans backpedaled and retreated after calling out Trump for assorted misdeeds, lies, creepy courting of murderous dictators like Putin and cravenly obnoxious behavior. Standing up to mob behavior, especially from brainwashed followers of an authoritarian wannabe dictator, isn’t easy— but the future of our country and whether the rule of law survives is at stake. '

'My sister was just diagnosed with MS a month ago. She was told yesterday her policy will be dropped as a result of this move. So now she can only afford to let her condition worsen until she has to be admitted to a hospital. Can somebody explain how this saves money,when we need to pay for her inevitable emergency room visit anyway? Forgetting the impact on her quality of life, and inability to work without treatment. Such a short sighted move.'
'No doubt, stocks he and his family shorted before the speech. But I digress. If he wants the insurance companies to do badly, then move to a single payer system ~~where they\'ll all be out of the health market~~. ("Plunge" = 3%, btw) [EDIT: fixed per comments below]'
"I hate him so much. My family's premiums and costs will go up and I'm 4 months pregnant. He's evil. "
"Trump is such a disaster. He's a disaster on an unprecedented level. He's narcissistic, stupid, vindictive, and dangerous. He has no plan. He has no strategy. He's just a wrecking ball. And while some people say we'll recover, as we did from Nixon and Bush, we won't. No, we won't recover, because everything is relative, as Einstein said. So what's happening is the rest of the world is moving forward while we try and go back in time. \n\nOur education is failing, our infrastructure is aging, and our thought leadership is slipping. Twenty years from now the US will not be the best place to work and live, and with that we'll have massive brain drain, if it isn't already happening. America is about to take a back seat to the rest of the world. "
"This isn't about you or me, or whether or not Trump cares about healthcare in the US. THIS is all about his boner for Obama. Trump is a man who by all accounts likely never had the approval of his father craves adulation, and since there is a large portion of the population who will not give him that kind of adulation they had for Obama he will try and hurt them in any way they can. One of those ways is undoing everything Obama did whether it is the right thing to do or not, and as a bonus its a dog whistle to his most rabid sycophants. The horrifying part is he cares so little for the effect his actions have on people he as long as he gets what HE wants out of it is the thought of what will happen if we ever get to the point where nuclear war is a possibility knowing HE will be ushered off to some bunker and likely survive.

'I thought we all hated insurance companies and wanted a single payer system?'
"This isn't going to immediately hurt the low-income people receiving subsidies to purchase ACA plans. It's going to hurt the people that were constantly interviewed on Fox news lamenting their skyrocketing premiums under the ACA. The middle class folks who make too much to qualify for subsidies and have to buy plans on the individual market, paying the full premiums of the enhanced coverage plans mandated by the ACA. They did see large premium increases under the ACA...and this is going to jack those premiums up another 20-25%. The very people who wanted the ACA repealed by Trump are instead getting screwed. The irony of him boasting about fucking over the GOP's poster children for ACA repeal is so, so delicious.\n\nThe only thing that would make it better is if they were smart enough to realize what's actually happening. They might, bills are one thing that even the densest of Trump supporters can understand."
'Good. Fuck the insurance companies. Why the fuck did all their stock go up 500%+ after Obamacare? It was fucking robbery. '
"I'm seriously surprised people can't understand why we don't like for-profit healthcare yet think this is a disaster. It will heavily damage the economy. That's a bad and avoidable thing too.\n\nStop being fucking childish so you have an argument."
"Quite an accomplishment to throw the insurance marketplace into a tailspin. It's nice that this fucker only thinks about his ego and has absolutely no regard for the people who are sick and actually NEED the insurance to live. That's what happens when you were born with a silver spoon up your ass and are used to people kowtowing and toadying to your every whim. The winning never stops, no brakes on this train."

"What was that about people kneeling being disrespectful to the troops again? Let's recount on Trump:\n\n- Repeatedly lied to avoid Vietnam\n\n- Lied about collecting money for veterans \n\n- Verbally attacked and tried to embarrass a gold star family\n\n- Doesn't know words to National Anthem \n\n- Refuses to visit war zones"
"Hasn't it been well established that Trump Hates the troops? Tried taking  retired veterans disability payments away and  tried to defund  a successful housing program for homeless veterans. Not to mention openly mocks them  and belittle achievements."

"No golf courses in combat zones.  Of course he won't visit the troops.  They're worth even less to him than the civilian middle class in the United States.  \n\nStill pisses me off that this draft dodging bloated gasbag equates his private military school he attended as combat service.  Still baffles me that any serviceman or servicewoman would support this asshole.  The 'increased defense budget' will go to defense contracting companies, not them.  Military people are not rich enough for Trump to give a shit about."
"A Fuckwork Orange couldn't even give a military widow his condolensces for her tragic loss of her husband without butchering that up and by some divine intervention of the highest order of being a fucking idiot - he manages to offend her.  \nOf course he's not going to visit our military currently in active combat zones. His head would explode just trying to google and map where to find a McDonald's (if there is one in reasonable distance) that actually has his big macs before bedtime on the menu to order."

'I would go so far as to argue, if your opinion of Donald Trump is "he is NOT a racist", then you very likely have racist tendencies yourself. \n\nNote:  This certainly isn\'t the case for everybody.  Not everyone, that has a mistaken belief about someone, is what that person is.  That said, there is so much evidence publicly available in favor of the conclusion that Trump is a racist, you would have to be consciously disregarding all of it to hold the opinion that Trump is not racist. '
'A brief history of Trump\'s racism, that we know of:\n\n>October 1973: Donald Trump and his father, Fred Trump, are accused by the Department of Justice of refusing to rent apartments to African Americans. The case was settled two years later. The Trumps did not admit guilt. From The Washington Post: "Two former Trump employees ... were quoted in court documents as saying they were told that the company wanted to rent only to \'Jews and Executives\' and \'discouraged rental to blacks.\'"\n\n>March 1978: The DOJ accuses Trump of not living up to the terms of the 1975 settlement and continuing not to rent to African Americans.\n\n>May 1989: In a full-page New York Daily News ad, Trump calls for the execution of the Central Park Five, five black and Latino teenagers accused of raping a white woman in Central Park. They were later exonerated based on DNA evidence, but Trump refused to concede their innocence, calling the city\'s $41 million settlement with them a "disgrace."\n\n>1991: A book by John O\'Donnell, a former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, quotes Trump complaining about a black accountant: "Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. ... I think that the guy is lazy. And it\'s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It\'s not anything they can control."\n\n>October 1992: A New Jersey appeals court upholds a $200,000 judgment against the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino after managers removed black and women dealers to cater to a mobbed-up high roller\'s prejudices.\n\n>February 2000: To stop a competing casino from opening in the Catskills, Trump runs newspaper ads showing hypodermic needles and drug paraphernalia, saying, "The St. Regis Mohawk Indian record of criminal activity is well documented."\n\n>September 2010: Trump tells David Letterman that Muslims should not build a mosque in Lower Manhattan, near Ground Zero: "Well, somebody knocked down the World Trade Center. ... Well, somebody\'s blowing us up. I mean, somebody\'s blowing up buildings, and somebody\'s doing lots of bad stuff, David."\n\n>February 2011: Trump tells the conservative gathering CPAC, "Our current president came out of nowhere. Came out of nowhere. In fact, I\'ll go a step further. The people that went to school with him, they never saw him. They don\'t know who he is." (This is false.)\n\n>March 2011: On The View, Trump embraces birtherism: "I was a really good student at the best school. I\'m like a smart guy. They make these birthers into the worst idiots. Why doesn\'t he show his birth certificate?"\n\n>June 2013: Trump tweets: "Sadly, the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and hispanics [sic]." (This is false.)\n\n>June 2015: Announcing his candidacy for president, Trump says, "When Mexico sends its people, they\'re not sending their best. ... They\'re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\'re bringing those problems with us. They\'re bringing drugs. They\'re bringing crime. They\'re rapists.

Both means that the migration got to be halted, untill we find a way for people to migrate properly, instead of ending in a suburban area where they face the same problems as where they where fighting for. \n\nMigration should be people living amongst each other, but in reality we doesn't see that a lot. Theres just giant areas with high intensity of migrants. Those suburban areas become gang infested, drug trafficking, money laundering hotspots with a high crime intensity.  That's just the facts. In The Netherlands we got The Hague Schilderswijk, Rotterdam West(Where I live), Amsterdam Zuid-Oost (and a lot more places).\n\nPoliticians must stop pretending that migration is all fine, a lot of people find that to be diffrent. When your muslim neighbour doesnt speak Dutch, they live with 7 in a small house, but drive a 130.000 euro car, yet recieving welfare from government because 'they have difficulties in getting food on the table' You know theres something fishy going on there. \n\nJust pointing this out doesnt make you a racist.

That should be cause for alarm and a wake up call that better vetting needs to be happening. If they don’t get ahead of it then yes it will become an even bigger issue than it already is. '

It appears that the Democrat's base either forgot that Obama did this, or is being completely manipulated by the mainstream media.  \n\nOh, I bet I know.  The mainstream media is slanted left and they are posted in subreddit echo chambers to those with preconceived notions who arent interested in finding truth, but rather be in a place who strengthens their already solidified opinions.  \n\nIslamic terrorists seem to be brown on most occasions.  It's because the countries that breed these terrorists happen to be in areas where the people are brown.  But, that's a simple factual observation, and therefore I'm Hitler!  \n\nA large part of the Mexican population is actually caucasian/light skinned/white.  Look it up.  So, is it racist to deport them, or is it a matter of doing exactly what previous Presidents did?  \n\nIf you are an American and you illegally cross into Mexico, you get 10 years in prison.  If you are an American and you illegally cross into Canada, you get deported, fined, and or thrown into prison.\n\nThank goodness we voted someone into office who is willing to do EXACTLY what Obama did and uphold our laws, defend our nation, and protect our borders! \n\nEveryother country in the world has immigration laws and upholds them.

We didn’t think you meant it in a positive way. There was a time when politicians like you preferred to use a dog whistle, but those days seem quaint now.

' The new bill does look far worse than the last one it punishes you for being sick and using health care if you get sick. Still takes  health care away from 23 million and seems to suggest more power to "decide" who actually qualifies to gets health care.This bill is a tax cut to the rich plain and simple. It is time to fight this before it\'s to late. this one needs to to front.'
'Disturbing as hell:\n\n>In a recent analysis, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) found that the Graham-Cassidy plan would "gut protections for people with pre-existing conditions," impose "damaging cuts" to Medicaid, and "cause many millions of people to lose coverage."\n\n>By 2027, the Graham-Cassidy plan "would be virtually identical to a repeal-without-replace bill," the CBPP concluded. "CBO estimated that the repeal-without-replace approach would ultimately leave 32 million more people uninsured. The Cassidy-Graham bill would presumably result in even deeper coverage losses than that in the second decade."\n\nBorrowing from [another article](https://thinkprogress.org/trumpcares-back-and-now-it-will-let-insurers-jack-up-premiums-as-soon-as-you-get-sick-38fff5001bf9/) posted yesterday:\n\n>...currently the Affordable Care Act forbids insurers from discriminating against sick patients by denying them coverage or charging them higher premiums. Graham-Cassidy, however, wouldn’t simply allow waivers of Obamacare’s protections for people with preexisting conditions. It would also permit insurers to charge higher premiums to people who are currently insured through the Obamacare exchanges as a condition of “continued enrollment.”\n\n>In essence, an insurer could take someone’s money for years while that individual is healthy. Then, on the day that that person is diagnosed with cancer, jack up their premiums so high that they are no longer affordable. Healthy people would have insurance until the moment they need it, at which point their premiums could become prohibitively expensive.\n'

'“It’s a shame what’s happened with the FBI,” President Trump told reporters yesterday, “really, really disgraceful.” He was building on criticisms he’d levied earlier this month, when he labeled the Federal Bureau of Investigation “tainted” and said its reputation was “in tatters.” The president claimed that ideological bias was behind the FBI’s decisions about criminal investigations involving Hillary Clinton and Robert S. Mueller III’s ongoing special counsel investigation.'
'Why even bother trying to disprove a ridiculous claim that he just spouted out to distract everybody from his own problems?'
'Trump is so delusional. So now the Smear campaign against Mueller is mission accomplished?? hHAHAHAHAHAH. If you gonna fire mueller you will get fucked in the ass.'

Loudly declaring that these ideological conservatives think you\'re a moron isn\'t a great defence. I guess he\'s already practicing his "too incompetent to be guilty"  defence. '
'Trump supporters need to get over the idea that the only possible reason someone might not like Trump is partisan bias or sour grapes over losing the election. If it turns out a heavily conservative organization has a lot of people who think he sucks, maybe that has less to do with them being biased than it does with him actually sucking.'

'Fuck a graph. People even now, do not understand corruption and war(not all war is guns and bombs). We are not going to have democracy by election season next year. The republicans have never played by the rules and Trump came in and said instead of cheating just flip over the board. The republicans lost a senate race in Alabama and their reaction was to push through their agenda even more even though nobody wants it but them and their core group of wealthy donors and idiots who vote for them. They know they can no longer hold on to power within the current climate so what do you think they are going to do when their survival depends on them keeping power. \n\n\nThey are already fully authoritarian fascist and their agenda is just to get rid of all checks and balances to their power. I said since the beginning that this was a coup in plain site. Look at the cronyism going on. They are infecting the courts, the DOJ and the court of public fucking opinion with propaganda networks. (How to be a dictator for dummies)\n\n\nWAKE THE FUCK UP THIS IS A FULL SCALE COUP.\n\nI hate conspiracies and I really have no interest most hyperbole but I know people and history. People are complacent and just don’t understand how far gone republicans are. Power is addictive and even more so for authoritarians. They cannot help themselves and have lost touch with American values.\n\nJust think of watergate. The “what did the president know and when did he know it”. That moment should have happened when the Trump Jr email leaked. That in itself is should of initiated full distrust at the least in the Trump regime by everyone including congress, the DOJ and all Americans. It has been so much envelope pushing people forget basic flat out lying in itself is an admission of guilt in any scenario. Imagine being locked up or investigated and saying I never met that person in my life but you have emails, meetings etc. We lost common sense.'

He lied about his campaign planks, he's lied about his personal situations, and he's even lied about how he became president.\n\nI hope this liar goes away soon."

'Of COURSE Russians funded Trump.  \n\nThe thing to understand about Russian oligarchs is how they view democracy.  Any movement "of the people, by the people, for the people" Threatens their  power; democratic societies were designed to undermine oligarchs. \n\nTheir number one enemy is a democratic society.  This 2015 piece from *Time* describes it in better words than I can:\n\n>Russia invaded Ukraine not to halt a “military coup,” as President Putin rather oddly claimed on Monday, but to hinder a democratic movement by military action. In Syria, Russia has helped and presumably will continue to help Assad repress all resistance, not just the Islamicist variety.\n\n>From Moscow’s perspective, there is not much difference between university students protesting in Kyiv for closer ties with the European Union and Islamicist terrorists gaining ground in Syria. In both cases, Russian leaders can, quite understandably, see a coming domestic problem. If people can gather peacefully in Kyiv, why not in Moscow? If Islamic terrorism can work in Syria, why not in southern Russia?\n\n>But the more important factor is domestic public opinion. Russia is a television culture, and Russian television news is devoted almost entirely to the world beyond Russia. In the last few days, Russian television has completely changed the subject: from Ukraine to Syria. What must not be mentioned is that Russia has not achieved its goals in Ukraine. The Ukrainian war shows that Russia can fail even when the European Union pays only a very small amount of attention to the conflict. What Russian leaders seem to want in Syria is a war without EU sanctions, which they can win for the viewers at home.\n\n[source](http://time.com/4054941/putin-russia-syria/)'

"I'm SURE this is the smoking gun that will cause his supporters to leave him! IM POSITIVE.\n\nSeriously, it could be a snuff-film starring the quadriplegic son of a man who was killed in action and him in a clown suit and it wouldn't matter. Deep State, Fake News, Sad. "
'Trump said despicable racist comments from the podium during his campaign. Having tape of him saying racist things in meetings will probably just secure his base even further at this point.'
'I hate trump as much as the next guy but release the damn tapes or shut up'
'Release it then! Can we just stop throwing all this shit out and finally have something we can show? I\'ve had to listen to people defend him for his Charlotteville response and not believing he\'s a racist because that wasn\'t obvious enough for them. Because they twist that shit and ask questions like "well, wouldn\'t you agree that there is a possibility that there were people there who simply protested the removal of a statue because they want to preserve history?" And while people who want to keep statues of racists are also racist to me, Trump supporters do not think that way. Unless someone is a member of the KKK or says straight forward racist things they don\'t believe it is racism. \nIt\'s fucking annoying that most of us know that there is a high probability that he said very racist things about black people and Jews but for fuck\'s sake we need to show it to the fraction of his supporters that won\'t believe it otherwise in hopes that it will make them turn away from him. Because while the KKK is going to be all excited and jerk their tiny dicks to this shit, the ones who are currently oblivious to the racism might finally not want to be associated with him. '
'If someone posted an article titled "Clinton shown on tape molesting child sex slaves in pizza shop, says anonymous nobody not showing the alleged tape" it would be downvoted to oblivion and OP would be accused of being a Russian agent.'
'Release the fucking tapes you disgusting fucks.  '
"RELEASE THE GODDAMN TAPES you fucking imbeciles\n\nThe republic is at stake!  The most powerful nation on earth!  This is, in a significant sense, a fate-of-the-world issue.  What in the **fuck** is preventing the tape holder from uploading that shit or even just selling it to CNN?  Copyright problems?\n\nHow many times over would activists contribute enough $ to accommodate the legal fees, punishments, and penalties?  It almost makes me believe that such tapes don't exist, but, y'know...it's Trump.  It's always worse than you think at first."
'Clearest proof yet that Trump\'s an old-school racist bigot. But, I mean, when you call those marching alongside neo-nazis and the Klan "Very fine people" then call black NFL players protesting injustice "sons of bitches" – You\'re a racist. '
'His racism is a feature to his base, not a bug.'

"I assume it's not actually a sex act the way everyone else here is. It's probably not that.\n\nBut by golly can you only imagine if we had definative proof that Trump is terrible in bed? Like, he's obviously terrible in bed, the guy is allergic to both cardio and empathy. But can you imagine the tweetstorm if the whole world started calling him a 2 pump chump?"
"There's no way this lives up to the hype. It probably has proof in the form of hotel receipts or photos of them in robes or written communication or something. No way it could possibly be a sex tape or nudes. I just deny that as a realistic possibility. It's just not that. It can't be."
"Is there anybody who doubts the affair at this point in time?   \n\nIf you do, let's be clear: trump paid her $130k and had her sign an NDA.  \n\nIf you think it was for some other reason than to cover a sexual relationship, please, enlighten me.  \n\nEven if it was actually the lawyer who paid the money (which is patently ridiculous), but let's say it was. Why? Why would a shyster piece of shit lawyer pay a porn star $130k and then have her sign an NDA that relates to his boss? Explain it, and I will shut the fuck up. If you can't, you are nothing more than a sycophant fucking moron like your orange hero."
"Politics have become too polarizing.  If a Trump were a Dem, and this situation was abound, the GOP investigation and attacks would be non-stop.  There have been many other Dems that have lost their positions with lesser transgressions, and yet the current GOP are turning a blind eye to what's currently unfolding."
"The number of people saying they allegedly have a sex tape of the 45th *_President_ of the United States* is too damn high.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nJesus fucking christ the fact that this is an actual thing is so damn embarrassing, it's laughably far past the point of not being funny"
'Just so we are clear, a guy is a horrible scumbag if he takes sexual recordings of a girl or pictures and then distributes them online without that persons consent. But this is totally cool?'
'No wonder they released that report about how they can fake a CGI video of someone doing something they didnt.'
"Don't pretend for a second that the Republicans will abandon him over this. Its being built up in the media as a huge scandal if true, but a sex tape doesn't even come close to the stuff already out there. The evangelicals and those that voted for him out of spite and desperation won't blame him for an affair when they don't blame him for anything else. "
"The only self-deluding people left on earth who don't know Trump is a lying sociopathic scumbag are the evangelical lemmings. "
"By the gods, how much would you have to pay me to watch that mess....? I've seen things online, horrors that would make Lovecraft squirm, videos claiming to be pornography that belonged in a infectious disease instructional video for new doctors, challenges to the intestinal fortitude of the most jaded online greybeard and yet I shudder at that (alleged) undulating collision of silicone, hair spray, fat, and ego. I shall pass this time, Lucifer, take your wretched bargain to Faust."
"You dirty bastards, talking about Trump's dick. Maybe it's just Trump confessing on video that he had the affair. Ever think about that?\n\nOr... maybe you're right. "

'Reuters was unable to independently verify that the vessels had transferred fuel to North Korean vessels, whether the Russian state knew about the sales or how many Russian vessels were involved in the transfers. It was also unclear how much fuel may have been smuggled.\n\nTwo anonymous sources with regard to Russia is a far cry from the visual evidence we have all been provided from satellite imagery of China supplying NK.  '
'"Why are CNN and Hillary disguising ships and smuggling oil to NK? Sad!"'
'Puppet, puppet, a dumb fat ugly puppet.'

'Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death...'
'Context is important - from the linked Reuters article:\n\n> "Russian vessels have made ship-to-ship transfers of petrochemicals to North Korean vessels on several occasions this year in breach of sanctions," the first security source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.\n\n> A second source, who independently confirmed the existence of the Russian ship-to-ship fuel trade with North Korea, said there was no evidence of Russian state involvement in the latest transfers.\n\nSo I guess it\'s dicey. Should be taken seriously but there is no belief that Russian government was involved, evidently, which seems to be the focus of the recent tweeting (calling out governments that violate NK sanctions.) Should still be looked into though.'

'you liberals are mentally ill, Stalin literally murders millions of people so you compare him with trump because trump called some countries shitholes'
"Oh, i guess that makes it ok. Comparing Trump to mass murderers is normal anyway, i can't wait for Trump to get impeachment so we can stop those death camps in America. How much more deaths can we handle... "
'Who gives a fuck what this bitch thinks or has to say. He votes with trump 100% of the time. He cares enough to save face before he retires, but not enough to prevent america from financial rape. Fuck him and fuck you if you buy his line of pseudo-criticism. '
"Stalin was socialist, Trump supporters fucking hate socialism and communism. It's leftists who love that stupid shit because they don't know any better. If you don't see the good that Trump has done for this country so far, it's because you don't know how to invest."
"I remember when right wing idiots used to say liberalism was a mental illness and I'd laugh. But in 2018 liberals have very clearly been driven to madness. Banding together to slurp awful pieces of shit like Jeff Flake because they hope he'll get their mean President/Dad to stop bullying them."
"Didn't stop him and his friends from taking advantage of a total power situation and giving himself and his friends permanent tax cuts. This motherfucker thinks well just follow the fuckin carrot. Fuck him and the whole party. They use public outrage as a deflection and ride the wave of rage every week to they make themselves sound critical of trump while they collectively do whatever they can before they lose their flash fire of political power."
"Jeff Flake has voted with Trump's plans 90% of the time. https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/jeff-flake/\n\nGet the fuck outta here with this shit. Republicans can pretend to be outraged about Trump all they want. The reality is that Trump is the endgame of their hateful rhetoric. He is their policy points distilled into a person."
'Stalin’s reign killed millions. Don’t devalue those deaths.'
'I dont like Trump, but fucking Stalin? Really? He is the worst human being to have ever existed on the planet. Trump hurt liberals feelings by refering to a nation as a shithole.\n\nThere is a fucking difference.'
'No one, absolutely no one should be commending Jeff Flake for this action because his \'speaking out\' is not sincere and not legitimate. Does anyone *honestly* believe Flake is taking this action without potential benefits to himself in mind? Even if it is only reputation, that is still benefit. \n\nWe, as a society need to move past this nonsense. We are smarter than this. This superficial politics needs to stop.\n\nFlake hasn\'t been living in a bubble. The *policy* of the Republican party *is* one of corruption and obfuscation. I\'m not speaking hyperbolic. The truth is in everyone\'s face. The Republican Party chooses to ignore facts. Their policy is to ignore facts. We have known for decades that trickle down doesn\'t work, we have known for decades that man made climate change is a fact, we have known for decades that criminal policies have unfairly targeted minorities, we have known for decades that immigrants are not the cause of all our problems. The list goes on and on and on.\n\nThese are the **facts**. These are the facts that Jeff Flake has chosen to ignore. It is the policy of his party and the policy he has adopted. He and his party has chosen to govern ignoring, spinning, and obfuscating the truth... *objective truth*. There is nothing more dangerous than that - rhetoric included. \n\nFor those that are giving rhetoric undue elevation I suggest rereading about modern governmental structures. They have, in large part, been made to buffer rhetoric. Rhetoric *can* cause problems. Action *does* cause problems. \n\nThe rhetoric is a problem for the U.S and for Flake and his Party in particular. It is a stain. But what runs deeper than a stain is the corruption that has become the policy of Flake\'s own Party. Again, ignoring objective reality is the policy of the Republican Party.\n\nAnyone that denies objective reality in favor of personal or Party gain does not deserve to be commended. It\'s my personal opinion that we are where we are in large part because those that follow objective truth tell ourselves, "well, these people just don\'t understand, we have to be diplomatic". I\'m sick of it. Absolutely sick of it. Flake knows the damn truth. He just doesn\'t like it. Tough. He\'s had the opportunity. It\'s offensive. It\'s offensive to our intelligence. It\'s offensive to the society he is claiming to represent. \n\nThis administration\'s rhetoric is vile but at least they aren\'t hiding behind a slick haircut and a nice suit. The rhetoric hurts *us*, the actions and policies hurt *humanity*. Flake is fine with the latter. '
'Except Stalin was much more competent and intelligent than Trump. And at least Stalin had Zhukov and a few others to openly defy him, no Republican politician wants to contradict Il Duce Donnie. The GOP has become the lapdog of the weakest, most incompetent leader in American Politics since Nixon. '
"You know what, fuck this guy. I'm sick of the grandstanding with absolutely no fucking action. You have all the power in the world to do what needs to be done Mr. Flake. Impeach the fucker already."
'The loser whose own internal polling was so bad that he decided to not even run for re-election? Yeah no one cares. '
"Okay, you're taking a stand. Great, all the more power to you.\n\nYou know what would actually help, though? Voting. If you don't want him to continue pulling the country into authoritarianism, and you don't want your party to continue enabling him, then risk losing the primary and fucking campaign on it! Resigning, if you really are committed to your principles, is not productive. The party will just select another candidate and, if the party is as corrupted by authoritarianism as you say, the candidate will likely be in favour of the same things you are resigning for.\n\nIf you're willing to resign then you already have nothing at all to lose from being outspoken."
'Trump is not only a Nazi but also an evil capitalist and communist. He is hitler and stalin himself. '
"Flake's words aren't enough. He votes with Trump every time. Words matter, but when they aren't backed up with action then they are empty or lies. "
"Resigning or stepping down isn't helping to solve this problem.  All it does is leave the door open for more of the same problem."

"As POTUS you have to be able to answer hard questions. You don't just surround yourself with Breitbart reporters and hold rallies months after you were elected. It's so ridiculous it boggles my mind. If you can't answer hard questions you're not qualified to be president."

"This pathetic spectacle alone should invalidate him as president. First amendment man, the guy can't even get past the first one."
"The day that someone throws a shoe at Trump or yell 'fuck you' is coming soon. He really opening up for people to yell insults to him when he openly insults others."
"I hate that we're at the point where reporters call the President of the United States a liar to his face, and it's considered the only reasonable response. :("

'He is the quintessential "ugly American". We are committing suicide on the World stage.'
"This doesn't work on people like Trump. He doesn't care that he makes the US look bad because he doesn't care about this country at all. The only way to shame a person like him is to make him feel inadequate and less than what he feels he is worth, it's why stuff like the Time magazine fiasco got a reaction out of him, because it's a popularity contest he feels he deserves but didn't win it. You gotta compare him to individuals that are better than him, compare him, size him up and pin what he screws up on, directly on him. "
"I can't believe we're living though this after the dignity that Obama displayed when he suffered through the bullshit the Republicans brought on him. Filibustering everything, blocking everything, repeatedly voting to get rid of the ACA, being wrong on net neutrality once already..."
"Christ I just can't get over how hostile he is to groups that don't support him. Imagine if President Obama said something that about Fox news. They'd be screaming about abuse of executive power against the press.\n\nHow can anyone in their right mind not see how disturbing it is that our president is so blatantly dividing us."
"I find Trump's tweet the most shocking. Don't let it be normalized. Telling your followers to watch a single biased news network while reporting that other news networks are fake is down right scary. That's pure authoritarianism. "
'Least respected president of all time.  Everyone shits on him.  If he had any sort o conscious he’d likely hang himself. '
'CNN is shit, but not for the reasons Trump thinks. And also, Fox News is 100x worse. '
'At this point I honestly just hate humans. As an environmental scientist by education, this administration just fucking makes me sick'
'That infantile poor excuse for a man needs to go.  He is a disgrace to our country and he deserves to rot in jail for his traitorous transgressions against the American people.'
'You know, of all the shitty things Trump is doing, his constant attacks on the press are the thing that most demonstrate him to be incompetent and bad for America.'
'Arguing with Trump is like arguing with a dumb bully, except the bully is the boss’s son and you have to pretend to listen. '
'CNN has got a lot of things it needs to do before becoming more credible. I’m a democrat who supported Sanders and they fucked up so much I can’t personally watch them. Even though Trump is full of shit deep down I know CNN can’t be counted on. '
'What a motherfucking embarrassment this fake President is. He’s been getting owned on Twitter the past several days. '
' Christ I am sick of Trump.  Watching from here in Canada you need your crazy ass fucking President the fuck out of my news.'
"Off topic but this whole left and right political war has gone way too far. Before politics was just a thing that happened and among friends it didn't matter. Now people HATE people for their political views without knowing the person. Is it not possible for the left to be right on some things sometimes and the right to be right on others? You can be liberal and be pro-life, you can be Republican and believe in global warming"
'Trump is such a whiny ass bitch. At least his name will live on a joke. '
"I really can't begin to understand the mental state of a Trump supporter.\n\nYour President is humiliating himself, and by extension the country, every single day. He is *patently* childish and vain. His public speeches are abysmal and sound like they're written by a kid. Time and time again, he chooses to divide the country over unifying it. Just ignoring all the politics, Trump is *undeniably* awful at being President. What reality can someone be living in when something so obvious can be denied? "
"How did this guy get elected, and why aren't you guys doing anything at all to prevent this from happening again? All I see is people complaining about trump, but nobody questioning why the dnc hasn't been reformed yet, why nobody sane on the republican side is making a move, or nobody is campaigning to reform the first past the post system, the core of all the US's political problems. "
'Too bad CNN  is full of shit '
"I just wish they would report the news instead of marketing opinions as facts.  I hate fox news as much as the next guy, but often times CNN does the same shit.  They package up opinions in fact wrapping paper and most people can't tell the difference. "
"I never thought I'd feel compelled to defend CNN; they are rife with problems, but they are an honest news organization. They're not a partisan outlet like Fox nor are they unethical about their sourcing. They have problems, but Trump is flagrantly dishonest. There's no comparison."

'> One day in late May 2016, Roger Stone — the political dark sorcerer and longtime confidant of Donald Trump — slipped into his Jaguar and **headed out to meet a man with a Make America Great Again hat and a viscous Russian accent.**\n\n\n> **The man, who called himself Henry Greenberg, offered damaging information about Hillary Clinton,** Trump’s presumptive Democratic opponent in the upcoming presidential election, according to Stone who spoke about the previously unreported incident in interviews with The Washington Post. Greenberg, who did not reveal the information he claimed to possess, wanted Trump to pay $2 million for the political dirt, Stone said.\n\n\nDamn. \n\n\n> Two years later, the brief sit-down in Florida has resurfaced as part of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s sprawling investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, according to Caputo. **Caputo said he was asked about the meeting by prosecutors during a sometimes-heated questioning session last month.**\n\n\n> Stone and Caputo, who **did not previously disclose the meeting to congressional investigators**, now say they believe they were the targets of a setup by U.S. law enforcement officials hostile to Trump.\n\n\nJust a little locker room concealment. Must’ve been so unimportant that they could naht recahhwll.'
'a famous liar lied? I am shocked I tell you.\n\nalso... "dark sorcerer?" Pathetic pill popping egomaniac with a thing for shitcaked dildos, maybe. Dunno how magical that is.\n\nCaputo is a piece of garbage who took Russian money for years to pimp Putin, sleeps with a Russian, and is currently producing a fucking Russian ballet. As if I believe a word he says about anything Russia. I like how nobody mentions Caputo\'s past and present in most of these articles. thankfully this one does. Wish CNN bothered to mention it while paying him big bucks to lie to us.\n\nguarantee you the GOP does nothing about this snivelling little shit lying to Congress.'
'Get fucked Roger Stone!  May your brand of politics be a relic of the past.'
'This is known as "getting in front of the story".\nStone was tipped off that this story was about to break, so he gives an interview where he floats a conspiracy theory that the evil Obama was trying to frame him with a Russian spy.'
'Newsflash: Trying to rob a bank and failing is still illegal.'
"So, I think any fair minded person is going to come to the conclusion that Trump's campaign was working Russian intelligence. Just exactly how intentional and how closely will have to be revealed. But, I think it's safe to draw this conclusion. \n\nThis begs the question, what do we do now? Assuming the GOP holds onto both houses of Congress, Trump will have to be stopped in 2020. If Democrats do take at least the House, impeachment seems pretty likely. Will Fox, Drudge, and the GOP establishment still stick with him? Will his followers accept it? \n\nTrump has and will continue to discredit the entire investigation and  he obviously doesn't care about the risks this presents if half the country doesn't trust the accusations against him. This is hardly even discussed, but it is very dangerous for a political leader to do this. Any attempt to go after Trump may provoke violence from his his supporters as they've been led to believe Trump is the victim. \n\nWe're in a really bad situation absent some concrete proof Trump conspired with Russia. We really need a tape recording or a video showing Trump discussing a payoff or something. Even with such proof, it may be very hard to get his supporters to leave him, but it would at least provide an opportunity. "
'> Reached by phone, Greenberg, 59, initially denied Stone’s account of a meeting.\n\n> “This is wrong information,” Greenberg said.\n\n> Later, in text messages to a Post reporter, Greenberg changed his story, acknowledging that he’d met with Stone and providing a skeletal account of the encounter that matched Stone’s in some ways. \n\nNot shady at all.'
'>According to accounts in Russian media, he was arrested in 2002 and charged with a decade-old $2.7 million fraud. The Moscow Times **reported that authorities found three passports with false names in his apartment** and photographs that appeared to show him posing with movie directors Steven Spielberg and Oliver Stone.\n\nIt does not seem outside the realm of possibility to me, that a guy with such a high profile, would be used as a cutout for the FSB. \n\n'
'If i were Obama i would be thinking " shit i should have stolen more pencils and toilet paper"\n\nThis is beyond insanity, people.'
'And Putin has a big grin on his face, crumbling America’s political system with an orange idiot and his dumb ass followers.'
'Fuck Republicans for ignoring this clumsy criminal behavior every fucking time. '
'But but but but fox told me that Hillary clintion is gonna go to jail and that the next doj report will reveal a "bombshell" oh and Obama caused the whole Russia thing too! And uh fbi is bad! /S '
'Jeff Sessions: “Ripping families apart is just a lil ol’  crime against humanity, no biggie, it’s good to pacify the undesirables and other non-white riff-raff in this nation. \n\nOh, what’s that you say? The GOP and many Trump organization officials are traitors conspiring with the Russian government to undermine our elections? Well, Republicans don’t have to follow the law, it’s optional for us. Silly liberals, so stupid with their ideas that laws apply to everyone”. \n\n'
'Hold the goddamn phone. Republicans and Russians in bed together? What a startling revelation. Look at my face to see how shocked I am.'
'All of trumps associates reveal Russian contacts because Russia elected trump. He lost the popular vote by a landslide, and only managed to take the electoral votes he needed because RUSSIA TARGETED THOSE DISTRICTS WITH A SHIT STORM OF SOCIAL MEDIA PROPAGANDA FOR MONTHS.\n\nRussia didn\'t interfere in our election? Really?  LOOK WHAT THEY GOT. A FUCKING CLOWN IN THE WHITE HOUSE. Who\'s now being sued, again, because apparently, every single "business" the man ever had was a complete scam. No surprise there. The Horrific Abomination in Chief. Hooray.'
'For a bunch of people who categorically denied any contact at all with "Russians" during the campaign people working with/for the campaign had an awful lot of contact with many different Russians explicitly for the purpose of getting Russian data on Clinton.'
'"Text messages that are no longer in his possession".\n\nYou mean that he destroyed because they were evidence against him? '
"Russia was sure working hard to bring down Clinton/elect Trump. Wonder what they have planned for this fall or 2020?  I would think they'll even be more involved, and have more experience of course. \n\nIf we look back historically, authoritarian regimes tend to gin up hate versus minorities in order to mobilize their supporters. I could see sensationalized MS-13 propaganda, I suppose. Alternatively, another terrorist scare could probably be used to target Muslims. I think people should be on guard for this type of thing."

'Relevant to the reason McCabe was given for the firing - unauthorized leaks to the press - Seth Abramson made a good point:\n\n>NOTE: None of the FBI agents who illegally leaked critical investigative data to Rudy Giuliani, Jim Kallstrom, Joe DiGenova, or the fake news website "True Pundit" in October 2016 have been named, investigated, or fired. This despite the fact they tried to influence the election.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SethAbramson/status/974863292924604416?s=19\n\nThe implication is that this is evidence McCabe was being singled out as a target.'
'This shit is emotionally exhausting.  What the fuck has this country become?'

"We hold our president to a higher standard when it comes to breaking the law. Dead hookers have to be involved.  So don't expected to see any repercussions.\n\n"
'The rest of the press pool should’ve gone Dutch and repeated the question until they were all thrown out.  The reason people don’t like the press, and the Democrats is because they’re weak. It makes them look complicit in all the fucked up shit in the world. And when they’re not holding the  ne’er-do-wells accountable, they kind of are. '
"How many laws has Trump broken?  I think I've lost count.  This is what happens when a fascist takes power.  Democracy and the rule of law in the US is on life support right now."
'I’m sick of Headlines saying “President Trump did something dishonest, immoral, stupid, and corrupt.” That is not longer news, all of these headlines should read “Republicans continue to tolerate a president who does something dishonest, immoral, stupid and corrupt to serve their own agenda at the cost of America’s collective good.” The news cycle should really shift the focus to the next level of responsibility, if republicans won’t impeach this asshole then the public needs to be prepared to vote them out later this year.'
"I'm no fan of Trump, but this is click-bait. Any president can exclude a member of the press from an event in the oval office. Telling someone who is shouting questions at you to get out of your space is reasonable, even if that person is doing the right thing.\n\nEdit: I really fucking hate having to make points that tend to align with Trumpet story lines. It make me mad, and I don't like having to defend evil people. But when anyone makes false assertions, regardless of whether they are my ally or enemy, it needs to be pointed out. People need to stop recklessly conflating every slight into a criminal act. There is a *metric shit ton* of stuff that Trump does that is illegal and/or an assault on our institutions. Kicking *one* reporter out of an event with a foreign dignitary is not one of them."
"When invariably Trump orders the military to do something that's previously unheard of, don't be surprised if they do it. We Americans need to listen to those who have lived under totalitarian rule; this is how it starts. He got the Secretary for Homeland Security to say she's unsure whether Norway is a predominantly white country...a secretary whose lastname sounds Scandinavian. And my guess is that Trump never had to explicitly tell her to lie. Nor did he tell Tom Cotton to lie. He doesn't have to. He's already shown his people what pleases him and what happens to those who do not please him. The rest is human nature, cowardice and self preservation. \n\nRemember they are doing all this to cover the obvious fact that the president use a bad word. Imagine the lengths they'll go to cover up a real crime.  "
"Dreamland: /r/politics continues to be disappointed that the president isn't be charged with the obvious crimes he is committing.\n\nReality: /r/politics continues to up-vote nonsense that no sane prosecutor would dare to get near for fear of being laughed out of court."
'Haha kicking out Jim Acosta for asking an inappropriate, race-baiting question is now a crime. Was eating 2 scoops of ice cream while everyone else only got 1 a crime too?'
"Jim Acosta is a fucking douche. I don't care who kicks him out of any media event just as long as he is kicked out. Fuck that guy. "
'So you can be a rude interrupting asshole and its against the law to throw you out? Hmm...interesting.'
"I'm not a fan of Trump but how is it against the law to kick some fake news reporter  out ? "
'I think Jim Acosta broke the law actually by making fake news. Its called slander and libel. '
'Oh Jesus. \n\nHere is the video:\n\nhttps://nypost.com/2018/01/16/trump-kicks-cnn-reporter-out-of-oval-office/\n\nThis guy does this every time. He obnoxiously badgers the same question over and over and over and deliberately acts obnoxious. He will sit there and act like a child in the hopes he gets kicked out so he will have a story.\n\nAnother time to show how he Accosts people:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.mediaite.com/tv/why-dont-we-turn-the-cameras-on-cnns-acosta-faces-off-with-spicer-in-off-camera-briefing/amp/\n\nThis guy is nuts and CNN should have replaced him instead of promoting him. Trump should ban CNN until they send someone who doesn’t go there to be the show. '
"How would this be illegal?\n\nIf the press weren't called on for questions and someone interrupted calling out questions, how is it illegal to have them removed?\n\n"
'lmaooooooo  BROKE THE LAW? \n\ndude this sub is sooooo fuckin lame.  \n\njesus christ'
"Jim Acosta was being a belligerent child. They said no questions, no one else was asking questions. Jim was the only one who felt the need not only to ask questions but to keep asking the same question over and over and over, being rude and interrupting even after it was made abundantly clear no further questions from ANY media were being taken. That's not breaking the law."
"Jim Acosta deserved it. I personally don't care for Trump on account of his utter lack of long-term thinking and his history of cheating on his wives, but the whole line that Trump is a racist because he suggested we bring in more people from Norway is disingenuous. Literally every time he has been accused of being racist there was a simpler explanation that liberals chose to ignore. In this case Trump brought up Norway because the Norwegian Prime Minister had literally JUST VISITED THE WHITE HOUSE. The difference between Norway and Haiti isn't skin color, it's development, crime rates and education levels. If Haiti and El Salvador aren't shitholes, why not move there yourselves? The good news is that, with a merit based immigration system, we don't have to worry about identity politics because individuals will be considered INDIVIDUALLY based on merit rather than their skin color or country of origin."
'If you\'re threatened by Jim Acosta you are very small and insecure. Sad stuff, "I love the poorly educated"'
"I mean, I hate Trump and I get where Acosta was coming from, but if he wasn't fielding question and Acosta wouldn't keep quiet, what other recourse is there? Just ignore him while you try to greet a foreign dignitary?\n\nI want Trump out of office but let's try to keep things in perspective. If we scream CRIMINAL! about shit like this, it's hard to be taken seriously when the really bad stuff goes down."
"Christ society took a turn toward childish this last year. Acosta is disruptive, purposefully. I'm shocked he has retained a press pass."
'Literally clickbait and fake news.\n\nThe same article says so:\n\n>“**There is no case law on this**, presumably because no prior president has stooped to these depths in treating reporters in this way. And my guess is that the White House will obfuscate the facts to shed doubt on the notion that Mr. Acosta alone was excluded and that it was due to the substance of his question.”\n\nIt doesn\'t "look" like trump broke the law, he literally didn\'t because there is no law about not expelling CNN reporters from the WH.\n\nAnd of course, all the top comments didn\'t read the article and fell for it.\n\n'
"It doesn't matter. Presidents break all kinds of laws, he's the chief executive, and until the shitheads and con-artists in congress decide they want him gone, he's not going anywhere.\n\n**If** he ever is impeached it will be over some marginal bullshit, but we may be doomed to this misery for at least the full 4 years."

'>I\'m smarter than all of them put together, but they can\'t admit it.\n\nWhat I for the life of me can\'t understand is why tf the media never asks him for specific examples. How hard is that, anyway? PRESS HIM. Make him put up or shut up.\n\nTrump says he\'s smartest: "Can you give us some examples of that?" \n\nTrump says there is endless fake news and lies.

I mean, this is the FBI we’re talking about. I think that is — that is treason. See, that’s treason right there ... By the way, that’s a treasonous act. What he tweeted to his lover is a treasonous act.\n\nAct?  Seems like that would be treasonous words, or a tweasonous tweet or something, but not an *act* by any means.'
'>I think that is — that is treason. See, that’s treason right there ... By the way, that’s a treasonous act. \n\nI think it is, that is, by the way it is.\n\nWho talks like that?'
'“Comey. Comey has proven to be a liar and a leaker. Proven. He tries to act like a choir boy. What he did with Hillary Clinton is outrageous. He saved her life, because all of those charges—I call it “Comey one, two, and three,” all of those charges and Comey won, she was guilty of. She should have been taken out of the campaign and been on trial. He didn’t do that. He saved her life. But here’s the way you look at Comey. Everybody hated Comey, and Comey—by the way, the FBI, say what you want, go back to look at the day around Hillary—the FBI was in turmoil. Everybody hated Comey.”\n\n WOW. He’s still stuck on Hillary.'
'What does it even matter anymore what he says? He has literally admitted to molesting women the only thing that can help us is criminal charges.'
'See, that\'s the part I don\'t get about all of this. Regardless if you are liberal or conservative, you shouldn\'t have voted for him at all because he is batshit insane.\n\nLets say that we could magically create an alternate universe and go back to the 2016 election, but reverse the roles of the candidates. Lets say that the Republican candidate was a normal, mainstream politician like Jeb Bush. He\'s a middle of the road conservative and comes from a family that has been in politics for a while and has experience in politics from being the governor of Florida. As a liberal I disagree with the majority of Bush\'s policies and I think his brothers presidency was horrible. There\'s no way in hell I would normally vote for him. Now, lets say that the liberal Democratic candidate was a rich celebrity that is known for saying crazy things and acting unhinged in interviews and public appearances. Lets say the Democratic candidate is, Kanye West. Music aside I personally think he\'s crazy and a lot of the things he says and does in public and in interviews I think are batshit insane. Now lets say that during his campaign for president he keeps saying that his agenda is liberal. He starts marking off all the things I want a president to do. He wants to create a single payer health care system, he wants to spend more money on education and science, he wants to create more systems to help the poor and homeless, he wants to address racism and police shootings, he wants to put more restrictions on predatory lending practices that led to the last great recession. I\'m like wow, I agree with everything Kanye West is saying. Then on voting day I walk into the booth and look down at the two choices I have in front of me. Under the Republican category it says Jeb Bush, under the Democratic category it says Kanye West. So who do I vote for...\n\nObviously I don\'t F\'ing vote for Kanye West why would I ever in a million years vote for a person who is mentally unstable to be the leader of an entire country??? Who cares what his politics are he\'s crazy. If I did vote for him it would be a huge mistake, here is why:\n\n1.Just optics alone would be horrible for the US. The rest of the world would think we are morons for voting for an off the wall celebrity who is crazy and doesn\'t know what he is doing.\n\n2.Optics aside it would be extremely dangerous. Kanye West has shown that he is prone to crazy outbursts, and in interviews sometimes he lies and/or doesn\'t even make logical sense. Having him with his hands on the nuclear "button" seems on the surface foolish, and deeper the reality is it would be dangerous for our country.\n\n3.Kanye West has zero experience in politics or how Washington works. Even though he has made a ton of money and is a rich celebrity married to a reality TV star he lacks any ability to understand the inner workings of how bills get passed, diplomacy is done, and why spending all your time on Twitter beefing with other famous people isn\'t a good way to utilize you time as the leader of the free world. He would be virtually useless as a world leader and would likely get nothing done and be more likely constantly dealing with controversy.\n\nSo in the end no I would not vote for an unqualified celebrity that has shown to be mentally ill, or at best unintelligent, even if they were a liberal. Anyone who does is not only risking our future, but the future of our children.\n\nEdit: Kanye West'

'Not gonna lie...even if they do meddle with out midterms....what’s stopping us from winning either way?

Hillary’s not on the ballot anymore and I think no one really likes he congressional republicans at all, only trump.  And before someone says, “what about voter tampering?”  Now that may have happened but I am inclined to believe that Russia hacked our elections through good ol psych warfare by using the trump campaign as a megaphone for their bullshit and making social media their bitch.

"As much as we like to blame Russia, we need to own part of this. I am in no way defending them. Their influence and propaganda campaign would never have worked if we didn't already have the ugliness which emerged over the past decade within us. They stoked the flames, but this is our failure. We failed to eradicate the evil within our society. Perhaps time to rethink this fanatical individualism, this hyper consumerism...this religion of free markets and cutthroat capitalism. It breeds feral and barbaric people who feel no responsibility to the society from which they emerged."

'Legit question: why cancel the meeting? Would it not be better to go to the meeting and demand that Russia cooperate with the investigation and cease the meddling? What good does cancelling do?\n\nEDIT: and please don\'t reply "well, he won\'t confront Putin anyway, sooo..." or something along those lines. Obviously going there and acting buddy-buddy doesn\'t do much. Let\'s pretend that the options are going there and confronting Russia or not going at all. Why is not going better?'
'The real reason he should cancel is because he\'s in Putin\'s back pocket and he wants to meet with him privately with nobody else around. Whatever will be said in that meeting will not be disclosed to the American people and that\'s completely wrong on so many levels. Especially considering the President\'s inability to tell the truth. He\'s been protecting Russia since day 1 and this "summit" is an obvious attempt to sate Putin. Trump isn\'t going to do anything about this. He knows Russia helped him but he will never fess up to it because (1) he\'s a liar, (2) he doesn\'t want to admit that his presidency could be illegitimate, (3) he owes Putin something for all of the hacking that he was very much aware of ("Russia, if you\'re listening...")\n\nNo shit the trip should be canceled. We have a fucking traitor in office who doesn\'t serve his country.'
'Trump would be a idiot to go to it. This will basically confirm what everyone like myself knew all along, & will also make Republicans/GOP in congress look bad. '
"Putin's number one goal is to fuck shit up. He'll meet Trump in Helsinki to let him suck his dick some more, which will show the world Trump is loyal to Putin even in light of the new indictments. Once Trump is fully committed, then Putin can drop whatever kompromat he has for maximum effect."

"I've said it before and I'll say it again, why did Julian Assange have phone access to Trump Jr. in the middle of the Russia Meeting crisis when they aren't supposed to have worked together previously? Answer, they obviously know each other from prior contacts they've lied about.  \n\nThe moment the Trump Jr. Meeting with Russians broke Assange contacted Donnie Jr. and gave him advice on that highly sensitive matter.  If Assange wasn't previously tangled up with Trump and Russia why would he make that call to try and help and why would the Trump's take it?  \n\n\nAssange is a liar. Trump is a liar. Jr. is a liar.  \n\n\nSource: Assange himself, look at the comments in this twitter thread. He was speaking with JR. and advising him on how to handle the media crisis right when the Jr,/Kushner, Russian operative hotel meeting story broke.  \n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JulianAssange/status/884853347815235584"

'Oh shit.\n\nConsidered a "non-state hostile intelligence service".   Oh boy.\n\nThat being said, prove it.  They\'ve shown themselves to be all for weaponizing information and propaganda.  At that piont, IMO, you lose credibility.  If you worked with a country to release information with an agenda targeting specific gruops or individuals, you\'re no longer a simple whistleblowing organization.  '
"Nothing matters anymore.  The majority of Republicans don't care if Trump colluded with Russia, Wikileaks or Neo Nazis.  Democracy died in 2016 we are just riding out the slow decline into Authoritarianism and the inevitable Dystopian nightmare that our country is about to become.  All we have to look forward to is the cold comfort of our eventual death. "
"I thought WikiLeaks couldn't be trusted and they were a lie factory that the Russians used exclusively to leak fake Clinton emails?"
'Wait. So we are outraged at the Trump campaign getting shot down for intel via Wikileaks, but not outraged that Hillary’s camp not only approached, but funded a phony dossier that led to the FBI to open an investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia? This sub isn’t doing it right. '
"So far we have a conspiracy to collude with a foreign entity to help win an election. It is pretty much confirmed the Trump campaign sought help by the Russians to win (Trump Jr. meeting and now this). \n\nJulian Assange and wikileaks confirmed that the Trump campaign reached out to them in order to get hold of Hillary's emails. They obviously denied that they took the offer, but we all know that is complete B.S.  as Wikileaks eventually did leak the emails and the Russians implemented their cyber attacks.\n\nThe chances of the Trump campaign having absolutely no knowledge of the upcoming email dump or the Russian cyber attacks are slim to none. \n\nThere is just too much smoke for all of this to be one giant coincidence. There was absolutely criminal activity within the Trump campaign."
"Can someone ELI5 why this is significant? The article is pretty clear, but doesn't really give any context. Has the campaign/Cambridge Analytica been denying any contact with Wikileaks? Didn't we already know that people connected with the campaign were asking around for those leaked emails? I'm having a hard time putting into context with the rest of the Russia stories. \n\nThere is so much going on with this investigation it's hard to keep track of what constitutes a break in the case or a revelation. "
'Reading Trump\'s comments on the Clinton campaign and the dossier is absolutely surreal... \n\nDidn\'t that Russian cock holster say something about "Russia,  if you\'re listening..."\n\nFuck him, his trophy wife and his whole existence. Bob Mueller needs to pick up the pace before Trump destroys the country beyond repair.  \n\nEdit: I accidentally a letter. '
'Now Trump will go from liking to hating Assange. I\'d almost be willing to put money on a tweet that Assange is a "very bad person" or some sort of childish insult. '
'"Julian Assange says on Twitter that Cambridge Analytica reached out to his group prior to last November, but Wikileaks rejected the company’s “approach.”"'

'The treasonous son of a bitch, God damn when will the GOP and his cult wake up'
'With the Russian intervention in Ukraine in 2014 (de facto occupying Crimea; they came in, forced the crimean legislative assembly under arms to hold a "referendum" generally not acknowledged as a free election, then "russian volunteers" started an "uprising" in Donbass), Barack Obama had one of his weakest points as President. The intelligence services were not prepared for the scenario, and Obama tried a soft approach, where a hardline stance was needed against Putin. Ever since, the ukrainians have gotten increasingly more international support; but with this limitation: everything was under non-lethal aid classification: training, equipment, counter-battery radars etc. The one red line that was never crossed; arms supplies.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd **this** is where we see Donald "I love Putin" Trump put down his only move that is directly harmful to russian interests, that differ from Obama. He sends them the one thing, the one weapon system they have above all others been asking for: a gamechanger in warfare against the "seperatists"\'s russian-supplied tanks (spoiler alert; they\'re russians and russian stooges). Donald Trump just committed the most overt obstruction we have evidence of. He bought the ukrainian\'s silence with weapons of war. This needs to be shouted loud from every rooftop.\n\n**This. Is. Obstruction.**\n'

Trey Gowdy has wet dreams that he had such evidence on anyone connected to someone who talked to a Clinton.

'Stop me if you heard this one before: An unpopular GOP president who won the election despite losing the popular vote is now pushing for a very aggressive stance against a Middle Eastern country that is 4 letters long and begins with an "I" over suspected weapons of mass destruction that no one has proof of, they just want you to trust their secret intel.  '
'I like how during his campaign he vowed to bring back jobs for oil and gas workers because oil prices were in the shitter.\n\nThen, a couple of weeks ago, Trump went on a tirade against OPEC saying that prices were too high. Now he plans on implementing the largest possible sanctions against Iran, cutting off their supply to the rest of the world, which will drive oil prices even higher. \n\nGod damn. This guy is so fucking stupid. '
"Everyone needs to keep in mind this isn't going to actually stop the nuclear deal. The UN is still in it.  What this does do is ruin America leading any negotiations in the future.  All based on lies. The money was given back to Iran because it was theirs anyway.  They had the money taken via sanctions.  The Intel from Israel was 13 years old.  Trump is doing this to either raise oil prices for Russia or is doing it just to spite Obama.  Could be both.  Either way it's embarrassing "
"This is goddamn deja vu. The administration is already accusing Iran of violating the deal, despite other nations stating there's no evidence of this. Withdrawing technically gives them free rein to restart their nuclear program, which now makes it easier for the US to cry WMDs. Also makes it easier for DJT to continue rejecting the opinions of other countries who are now making a deal with Iran, since he can frame it as them siding against the US. John Fucking Bolton is our National Security Advisor. We've already seen this movie."
"This is by far the most egregiously stupid (and major) decision that Trump has made thus far.\n\n1. It encourages Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. Can you honestly blame them?\n\n2. It tells both our allies and enemies to be very wary of dealing with the US. They are not trustworthy to stick by their word.\n\n3. Enables Iran's hardliners at expense of moderates, causing a regression of any progress we've made from deescalation.\n\nFuck this guy."

"Jesus Christ.\n\nTrump is so fucking dumb.\n\nThis fucking moron has no Earthly idea what this deal is about, what it does, what it doesn't do, how the US or any other country benefits.

'As an Iranian & a Canadian, here\'s my unbiased view:\n\nAs an Iranian, I believe this was a bad move regardless of how imperfect the deal was. First of all, sanctions don\'t affect the higher-up  people in the government much. They affect the people in those countries, you know, like teachers, working class, etc. People like me and you, just going about their days who happened to be born there. Before the deal, the progressive people inside Iran were holding the government accountable for spending money on the nuclear program instead of social benefits and infrastructure projects. This helped the new moderate government get to the office who brokered the deal and the economy got slightly better. Sadly, it\'s all gonna be burned down to ashes again. Well, who do you think people will blame now for their financial meltdown?...Trump. \n\nSo now even the moderates inside Iran are upset. Even worse, the conservative party will mock the current government for not being competent and will belame the sitting president for embarrassing the regime by acting "soft" and going to the negotiation table in the first place. What do you think will happen next? The conservative party will take over the office in the next term, making military the central power, and inevitably resulting in far worse destabilizion. Which is what the West doesn\'t want. Except, the gun manufacturers of course.\n\nAs a Canadian, I understand why people are worried. Iran obviously has a tense relationship with the gulf states and Israel. But pulling out of the deal without showing any sympathy towards European efforts, is such a d*** move. People won\'t trust U.S. in the international scene anymore if they see their president can just pull out of any agreement in one day, specially if they had to negotiate for years to make it happen! Even Canadian officials are on the fence now. Being an ally is slowly losing its meaning. It feels like U.S. is going from friends level to acquaitance. Secondly, Iran is a resourceful country. It\'s the second largest gas supplier, one of the top 5 oil exporters, full of mineral resources, has 80 mil population, and is located in the heart of the Middle East accessing two seas. European companies obviously want a piece of this pie and the agreement was a big economic bonus for them. Now, not so much.\n\nBottom line, I think this decision will actually escalate the existing tensions. If you\'re a Trump supporter, it\'s bad for you too. Because he didn\'t negotiate a new deal. He pulled out *hoping* for the Iranian government to return to the negotiation table. But the reality is that Iran is no NKorea, Iraq or Afghanistan. It has 2000 years of conflict history under its belt, and loads of resources. This makes everything a lot harder. Also, both the moderates who want a better relationship with the West, and the European officials are exhausted by Trump\'s stubbornness. This only leads this man to become more tangled up with the \'Peace in the Middle East\' rather than fulfilling his "America First" campaign promises.\n\n'
'Can someone PLEASE explain to me why this is such a bad thing? All I see is "Trump sucks, he is an idiot, omgWW3 we gonna die lul"; I don\'t KNOW why people are against this.'

What a pathetic, whiny piece of shit we've elected to the highest office in the country."
"This is fucked. I'm from Iran and it's fucked up the lives of pretty much everyone in Iran. We were on our path to a more liberal and more peaceful Iran after the deal and it all got fucked up by that irresponsible idiot. It makes no sense how a country full of so many close minded selfish idiots wields so much power in the world. And all you assholes worrying about how it in Dems vs Reps terms....\n\nEdit: I'm angry and hurt and didn't mean to offend all Americans...some of you guys are great some of you aren't but please realize the impact your country has on the world. You have a responsibility!"
"This is extremely stupid.  How is North Korea ever going to believe that we'll stick to a nuclear treaty with them now?  I fucking hate this president."
'If you guys still have historians in 100 years, this will be one of the key points in their history of how the US fell from its superpower standing. Your country is destroying itself internationally to line the pockets of some of its richest and half of its population is fully complicit. Looking from the outside in, I never thought I’d see this day. Even your worst presidents have made decisions that could they truly thought were in the country’s best interests. This and pulling out of international climate change policy are nothing more than an insecure baby trying to get one over on the black guy he hates. Never mind that it’s destroying decades of work by his predecessors. '
"Apart from how bad this is purely from increasing tensions with Iran, how the fuck is this in any way a smart move going into negotiations with Kim Jong Un and North Korea? Trump has literally just shown them that deals made with the USA aren't worth the paper they're written on. The USA can, and will, go back on its word for any reason it wants, even for something completely and utterly unrelated to the original deal itself.\n\nSo now Trump signs a deal saying things are all good with North Korea as long as they abandon pursuing nukes. That's **exactly** the deal that he just tore up with Iran. So why would Kim ever think that in the future the US won't turn around and say 'actually you can't develop missiles either or we'll scrap the deal' or even just 'you can't do military research or we'll scrap the deal'.\n\nIt's absolutely insane that someone who promotes himself as 'the best dealmaker' would do this right before trying to make one of the biggest deals of the last few decades when the deal he is trying to make is exactly the same as the one he just pissed on and described as too weak.\n\nAnyone who still thinks Trump is a genius or even a competent dealmaker - you're deluded beyond fucking hell and I don't know if you're beyond saving or not."
"Nobody is asking why this single person is allowed to make this decision without any checks and balances.\n\nLike Jesus.. This isn't some small shit... One fucking person shouldn't have the power to derail it... No matter who is president.\n\nWe just assumed our President wouldnt do this kind of shit... And it's worked out for centuries...\n\nThis is fucked.\n\nFuck you trump. You ultimate conman. \n\nWorthless piece of fucking shit trash human. You dont even know what the fuck you did. You only did this because of your fear of being lesser than a black man...\n\n\nYour insecurities are making our country dangerously insecure.\n\nFuck you."
'The IAEA aka the UN’s watchdog has already confirmed 10 successive times that Iran is complying with the deal. Trump is a fucking lunatic and pulls shit out of his ass.\n\nI shit you not, Pompeo said of Iran “we know they’re cheating anyway - we’re just not seeing it.”\n\nLoss of credibility for the U.S., higher gas prices, worsens relations with allies, I don’t see how this is anything but an L.\n\n'

'> A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men.

'The trump train is too real. If you stick it to trump, they come in hordes about some other ridiculous thing. This polarizing left vs right shit is going to lead to awful things and I don’t think Kimmel should be adding fuel to that. If politics should be involved don’t polarize it. However, what does a Kimmel tweet about president Trump have anything to do with Harvey Weinstein? \n\nHarveys a scumlord that we’ve known about forever and NYT wrote a great article about the incidents. And yeah Kimmel has worked with him and for all I know they’re friends, but who in Hollywood hasn’t run into him? The courts fail against high profile people and that’s an issue you should be on the President about not Jimmy Kimmel. its also good to see the failing and terribly run NYT is apparently no longer fake news.

'With this kind of behavior, I\'m worried about an accidental nuclear exchange. There have been a handful of well documented incidents in the past in which we were on the brink of nuclear annihilation due to computer error. It was only because of the steady hands of a few people in charge that those incidents were avoided, and in large part because they had enough faith that the leader of Russia/US were stable enough not to launch a surprise nuclear attack.\n\nThat\'s gone with Trump. No leader can be sure what he is actually doing or thinking. He is unstable. Additionally, there is the possibility that his instability has essentially frozen nuclear capabilities, with generals forming some kind of pact to not follow nuclear orders from the president. That also leaves us susceptible. It\'s a window of opportunity for some other country to attack, potentially.\n\nBut what if there is another computer error in NK, or China, or Russia that shows a volley of nuclear weapons coming from the US in their direction? Will they hesitate to "retaliate" with the irrational, unstable President Trump at the helm? Trump will not get any benefit of the doubt. That is my greatest fear. By trivializing nuclear war, he is making it more likely. M.A.D. only works as a deterrent if there are rational actors involved. The United States is not a rational actor at the moment.\n\nCogress has an obligation to remove him.\n'

We should be making it impossible to continue to ignore the problem. No one with a big enough platform seems to be advocating for this. Americans, by and large, don\'t seem to be angry enough to leave the comfort of their homes, and as a result, the GOP doesn\'t feel any pressure to act.'
'Who will be the one? All these men and women condoning and allowing this sad excuse for a President to continue to hold office. Who will stand for justice? Does no one see what he is doing to our country? To our Democracy? He is flagrantly tearing us apart and weakening our standing in the world. Yes, America is more then one man and will continue on after he has had his way with her but how can those that condone his behavior sit idly by and watch as he rapes our Democracy? He is using us just as he uses and abuses the women he has come in contact with. Will no one stand up? It will take voices to act. The place is here and the time is now.'
'I think above all else he should be impeached for this. I mean if you’re a 70+ year old “billionaire” who has lived an entire life grifting and conning anyone and everyone with zero repercussions and now suddenly you’ve reached the pinnacle of power only to find Mueller and the walls closing in to rip away from you everything and throw you in jail or worse if treason is found, this narcissistic manchild would start nuclear war and end life on earth to avoid any and all consequences.

Trump has to stop acting childish, this isn't a game... this is me and my families lives we're talking about. Why would he stoop to their level like this? Doesn't he know the USA is far superior to NK, has to act like it, and doesn't need to use threats or stupid tweets against them?\n\nFurthermore wtf is wrong with people, why do you guys want to bomb NK? Innocent kids live their that are just forced to live under the dictatorship and are either brainwashed or forced into believing Kim Jong Un.

It’s a lot of compromise, and understanding where these countries are coming from. He’s lived in a bubble his whole life where he’s gotten his way by bribing and bullying.

"I used to work in the oilfield.  Working overseas, particularly in Africa, you saw how the bribery scheme worked first hand.  You just didn't get the business without greasing palms, period.

Maybe that's why mine was based in Switzerland?\n\nThe whole thing is hopelessly fucked, though."
"The president claims to have a tremendous understanding of business but he fails to understand basic economics concepts. Corruption is a tremendous economic hindrance due to multiple reasons. Furthermore, enabling us companies to participate in corruption would significantly reduce our power to influence developing nations by demonstrating that our values are so unimportant that we are willing to discard them for the opportunity to make a quick buck. Such a shift in policy would be decidedly against American interests and the fact that the president doesn't just know that is very disheartening. "

Every last one of them. \n\nWhich could then mean, all businesses should be allowed to dump into oceans, lakes and rivers as the cost to do so is much less (for the business) than any regulated way. Could also mean Coke and Pepsi, etc. should be allowed to purchase every last liter of water through all rivers and lakes. There should be no public land that isn't available for private sector purchase because that's land that could be used for expansion or harvesting resources, etc. \n\nSo he's not wrong, but we have to decide when enough is enough and which things need to be illegal and which ones do not. Businesses being allowed to be foreign officials is straight up ridiculous like any one of the scenario's i mentioned, so no. "

'> I don’t care whether Michael Schmidt was tough enough. We’ve got bigger problems.\n\nUgh, fuck off with this bullshit. Trump rarely does interviews with non-Fox outlets. It\'s important that he get follow ups when he does. It\'s not hard, "what do you mean you can do whatever you want with DoJ? So, you think you are able to, or should be able to, direct the DoJ to investigate or not investigate a particular person or subject? Does the Department agree with you in this regard? Have you spoken to them about it? Have you brought it up with potential or existing U.S. Attorneys? Which ones? When? What did they say?"\n\nYour interview doesn\'t have value just cause Trump says stupid and actually unprecedented and unconstitutional shit. Trump does that all the time, even on Twitter when no one asks. What you have that no one else has, which is extremely valuable, is the opportunity to press him on it. And abdicating in that regard is woeful, it is something that the NYT has done the few times they\'ve had access to the President this year, and it deserves to get called out.\n\n'
"Alzheimer's. I've been saying it for months. His father had it, so we know he's predisposed. Here's a list of mid-stage symptoms:\n\n- Can no longer cover up problems. \n\n- Pervasive and persistent memory loss, including forgetfulness about personal history and inability to recognize friends and family \n\n- Rambling speech, unusual reasoning, and confusion about current events, time, and place \n\n- More likely to become lost in familiar settings, experience sleep disturbances, and changes in mood and behavior, which can be aggravated by stress and change\n\n- May experience delusions, aggression, and uninhibited behavior\n\n- Mobility and coordination is affected by slowness, rigidity, and tremors\n\n- Need structure, reminders, and assistance with the activities of daily living\n\nTrump checks all the boxes."
'> In 1984, Ronald Reagan debated Walter Mondale in Louisville and plainly had no idea where he was...Not long afterwards, I was interviewing a prominent Alzheimer’s researcher for a book I was doing, and he said, “I saw the look on his face that I see every day in my clinic.”\n\nJeez. This is the first time I\'ve seen someone corroborate what I remember seeing when Reagan was giving a State of the Union address on television. I\'d been traveling by car to visit relatives, and we stopped at a pizza place that had TV\'s on during the speech.\n\nI looked at him, then looked at my brother and said, "That man has Alzheimer\'s!" It was the look in Reagan\'s eyes. I\'d seen that same look in my dad\'s eyes as his Alzheimer\'s had been getting worse (my dad had passed a couple of years earlier). \n\nReagan\'s actor training held; he read his speech, but every so often he just looked ... haunted is the best word. He knew he was supposed to be reading his lines, so he did, but it was clear he had no earthly idea where he was. \n\nMy dad used to say, "It doesn\'t hurt. I just kind of wake up and don\'t know where I am or what I\'m supposed to be doing, but it doesn\'t hurt." It was obvious during Reagan\'s speech that he\'d \'come to\' and was just soldiering on. They took him off camera immediately afterwards, IIRC.\n\nI didn\'t like Reagan as president. But unlike Reagan, who I think was a fundamentally decent human even if I disagreed with his politics, Trump\'s just going to become nastier and nastier as his mental state deteriorates. \n\nSomehow, I just don\'t have the same compassion for Trump as I had for Reagan.'
"Not *just* cognitive decline, it's important to remember that while certain brain disorders can cause personality changes, Trump has *always* been a racist, narcissist, selfish asshole of the highest order and with the power of the Presidency and an obvious lack of interest in understanding how our gov't functions, he's a dangerous  authoritarian who imagines himself Dictator of the US, rather than President."
"I have a different theory, and although I suppose you could call it mental illness, or even cognitive decline, I see it as different than dementia.\n\nI see the President's issues through my own lens of dealing with issues of narcissism. A few decades ago, he was still young, virile, successful enough, and with much life ahead of him to still justify his massive ego. Then, his debt grows, his net worth decreases, he wrinkles and grows old, his legacy is in question, and he glimpses the unbearable reality of not actually being the God he always saw himself as. \n\nI feel like the key to understanding him is to see his absolute, all-consuming *need* to prove himself to be who he thinks of himself as. He needed to show the world that he was a great, legendary, genius man, and thus become president and be amazing at it. But reality keeps hitting him: Being President is hard, he's not as smart as he thought he was, he's constantly being attacked and demeaned and considered a joke to the degree he has to watch hours of Fox news every day just to feel alright. I just *can't* be...his entire self-image depends on proving them all wrong, at all costs. And every hit he takes, of which there are so many, just enrages him even more, and draws him further into his narcissistic defensive shell.\n\nSo why does he talk differently than he used to? I suppose you could call it a certain intellectual *laziness*, but I think what we're seeing is the mind of a delusional narcissist when he stops trying to waste energy pretending to be anything else. He's sick of pretending. He's a genius God beyond all you mere peons out there, and he's fucking sick of the world not getting it and giving him what he deserves. The caution of earlier days is abandoned in a late-stage, make-or-break mania of indulgence. He shouldn't *have* to waste time putting effort into constructing thoughts how YOU want him to. He's beyond that. The way his mind works is of course amazing and special, so why should he censor it? To consider censoring it is to admit he's not who he thought he was, and that just CAN'T be true. Sure, there's lots of logical disconnects there, but that's part of the point: It's not about logic, it's about keeping his narcissistic needs met. Watching Fox news does that. Getting cheered at rallies does that. Throwing off conversational filters and indulging in saying what he wants to say does that. Dealing with stuff that makes him feel stupid...doesn't do that, so he avoids that, and finds a way to justify avoiding it.\n\nSo basically, I don't see dementia or Alzheimer's as necessary to explain his behavior.

'Or a portrait of a guilty man whose sanity is being undermined by his wall of denial being undermined by terror of what fate could have in store for him.'
'I once went back and watched a ton of old interviews when he was in his 30s-40s. Two things stick out. He was articulate (relative to him now). And he actually had somewhat similar talking points. I’m not saying he would’ve been a good president then, but his personality is very different. Now, he’s scared people will find out he has no clue what he’s doing (we already know). So he hides behind his new persona. '
'Mark my words: Trump supporters will not acknowledge that their God Emperor fell into mental decline himself. They will come up with reasons to blame liberals, be that poisoning, psychological terror, harrasment etc. '
'It\'s so obvious that he\'s not mentally well, that I can\'t help but chuckle when I hear some rube proclaim that Trump is simply "saying what everyone is thinking".\n\nI can remember a time when people would be ashamed to make it publicly known that they thought like a rapist with dementia.'
'I disagree strongly. He was always like this, he was just never put in a position in which his bullshit ran out. \n\nHe\'s a bullshit artist. It\'s irrelevant whether he believes the stuff he says because it does not matter to him. What matters to him is to create reality, his reality. He just bullshits as best as he can and moves on. That\'s why he keeps repeating things like "no collusion". He\'s not degrading, he\'s just bullshitting the only way he knows. He doesn\'t even care that he had the election stolen for him, all that he cares is to live in a reality in which he did, but also didn\'t, where he benefited from it, but faces no consequences for it.\n\nHe just can\'t move on like he used to. He\'s like the Simpsons monorail guy who somehow got stranded in one of the towns he scammed. His whole scam depends on leaving and never coming back. But he can\'t do that here. His limited cognitive abilities are just more obvious than before because it\'s a situation he never encountered before.\n\nBut because journalists failed completely during the election at holding him accountable for anything he said, it wasn\'t as obvious as it is now. They still allow him to say obvious lies and not even counter him. But still the lies and the damage to the republic accumulate and every additional harm he does is just on top of every other one before.\n\nAll he has to rely on is his bullshit and that gets tiring quickly if he can\'t move on. It just piles up and seems worse when you can see it all in one place, like someone who never slept in the same place twice and always shit the bed after he left but now he has to go back to the same bed and where people may have seen the one turd pile now they see the last 2 years of bullshit all in the same place and they can\'t deny anymore that all he\'s been doing is bullshit about everything, every day.\n\nHe\'s the same bullshitting asshole he\'s been all his adult life. The only reason he appeared more coherent is that all he ever had to do is be a wealthy celebrity doing beauty pageants and a television show. It\'s like the Waldo episode of Black Mirror, you can get away with a lot of bullshit at first, but reality always reasserts itself.'

He's tangential.  He's forgetful and contradicts himself a minute later.  He should be removed from office. \n"
'As a Canadian who has soured somewhat on PM Justin, I am truly grateful we do not have anything close to Trump running our nation. Trudeau has his drawbacks, but they are normal, boring drawbacks. Jeezus, that interview almost made me feel bad for Donny, his mind is rotting.'
'I wonder if he gets tested for this by a doctor, and refuses to release the information because it shows he is in a cognitive decline, what duty does the doctor have to the country to tell us this guy is not mentally stable enough to be president?\n\nHIPAA laws and confidentiality exist but...I wouldn\'t want to be that guy making the decision of "Oh hey, this guy should not be leading us because he\'s going to kill us all." At what point do you take away someone\'s nuclear codes?'

'>Of all the facts in the Russia scandal, this one seems the most underplayed. Email hacking is one of Akhmetshin’s basic methods of operation. The Trump campaign met with a Russian spy who is known for pulling the exact kind of crime that was committed in this case.\n'
'I wish this mattered more to the people who voted for him but it doesn\'t. A 68 year old Vietnam veteran that I work with said today "who cares if the Russians interfered with the election as long as it kept that bitch Hillary out." He has such a visceral hatred of HRC that he voted for Sanders in the primary. Not because he\'s a  Bernie supporter, mind you, he voted that way in the hopes she would lose the primary.  He can\'t be reasoned with, as far as he\'s concerned Hillary is the literal devil. I don\'t know if it\'s misogyny, a hatred for the Clintons in general or what but a wartime veteran who considers himself a patriotic American, supports the troops(whatever that means anymore), and shoots off his AR-15 every 4th welcomes the interference of a hostile foreign agitator over having Hillary as president.

McCain is getting the credit, but these women are the ones who really saved Obamacare
'>“The Court can clean up a cause of America’s crisis in confidence in our democracy, protect our elections from wildly partisan ‘bulk’ gerrymandering, and return control of our elections to the people," McCain and Whitehouse said in a joint statement on Tuesday. "We hope the Court will."'
'Come on McCain, just do it. \n\nOut them all. Tell everyone how they speak about their own constituents. Tell everyone just who is owned by who. Talk about when they decided it was their way or no one gets anything. \n\nTalk about the secret families and strongly held rumors - if you believe it firmly enough to include it in your legacy, it’s probably true.  If you’re really finding your conscience now, then take them all down for the good of the country that you love. '
'McCain has always been for process reform. Remember, he was half of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform push (which he campaigned heavily for in 2000). AZ has been on the leading edge of that movement—including by enacting a public financing law that [SCOTUS struck down 5-4](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2011/06/28/us/politics/28campaign.html). \n\nIt\'s possible to be for a better democratic process in the abstract, without considering whether it will help your party. If it doesn\'t, then perhaps it\'s your party that should change. There\'s no principled defense of gerrymandering on the merits. The most you can say is that one party shouldn\'t unilaterally disarm while the other continues to gerrymander. But even if you accept this, you\'re still wasting people\'s votes essentially to even the score. You\'re not pretending it\'s OK. \n\nI\'ve never seen Republicans defend gerrymandering honestly as a good thing. Generally, they\'ll just deny that it\'s a serious problem (typically trying to change the subject to geographical sorting) and then trot out the tried and true "what about?" \n\nEverybody knows it\'s wrong. \n\nA few Republicans, like McCain and Schwarzenegger, are willing to acknowledge this publicly. [Others, like Reihan Salam, go further](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/07/opinion/how-to-make-congress-bipartisan.html) recognizing that although gerrymandering is a problem, eliminating it won\'t entirely fix the vote wastage. (FWIW, I think Salam\'s right, but I think there are better solutions than the multi-member district proposal he describes in the article--even though it would be an improvement.)\n\n\n  '
"I love that he's trying to get into heaven now."
"This country would've gained a potential 12 years of continued progression had the electoral college been abolished before 2000.\n\nWe wouldn't have had to go through Dubya and now the traitor had the popular vote been the deciding factor, which is most certainly should be."
"Your party made sure that wouldn't happen."
"I've been trying to keep an eye on this issue for sometime now. However I feel like I'm missing something and would like some clarification.\n\nThe last time gerrymandering got brought before the court, majority decided to keep it, with Kennedy being in the keep category, but just barely.\n\nNow, if I remember correctly, Scalia was in the keep it column, being a Republican (if were going with the idea that the justices, while supposedly non partisan, still base their rulings on ideologies present in either Republican or Democratic parties). With Gorsuch being his replacement, it's fairly certain that Gorsuch will vote the same way his predecessor did.\n\nWith that in mind, given that the court will likely split the same way again, is Kennedy still considered the swing vote?\n\n(If none of my ramblings make sense, let me know. Pretty sure I confused myself at some point)\n\nEdit: Fixed some spelling errors."
'The best way to return control of the elections to the people would to institute term limits.\n\nNo one needs to be a career congressman.'
'Wow something everyone can agree on. '
'The potential for this case is huge. I\'m hopeful that Justice Kennedy somehow saves the day (like he did in the *Obergefell* gay-marriage decision).\n\nHowever, i\'m not holding my breath. You need **five** votes on the Supreme Court to get a majority opinion, which is then the supreme law of the land. Anything less than 5 votes is a "Plurality Opinion," which has less legal impact, since the Justices couldn\'t agree on what the proper legal reasoning is.\n\nRegarding this Gerrymandering case, four Justices (Roberts, Alito, Gorsuch, and Thomas) believe that the issue is a non-justiciable *political* issue that should be addressed by Congress. Another four Justices (Ginsburg, Kagan, Sotomayor, and Breyer) **do believe** that Gerrymandering must be addressed by the courts, but they cannot agree on what legal standard to use. \n\nThen there\'s Justice Kennedy (aka "The Saint of Sacramento") who isn\'t quite sure what to believe anymore, but by God that won\'t stop him from writing 80 pages about it. '
'John McCain could have potentially been one of the best presidents of all time.'
'I think John McCain is trying to make sure he gets into heaven now'
'Man, this guy is great he should’ve ran for president.'
"He's not the Republican we deserve, he's the one that's dying soon.\n\n* PS - I'm a democrat, but I wish more Republicans were like this."
"I remember he was the first person I saw coming down the steps of the Supreme Court and addrrlessing/ denouncing the Citizens United decision. It stifled everything. Unions have become more vulnerable, the middle and lower class have become more vulnerable, and democracy itself has become more vulnerable. \n\nThis is The Oligarchy. \n\nIt's growing. The most powerful, wealthy, and morally bankrupt organization  that has existed on this planet. I love this country. We cant lose it to greed and recklessness."
'John McCain is one of those people who discredits the people who constantly refer to "the party of evil racist"\n\nDuring 2008 I was all for Obama but honestly I don\'t think we would of "lost" regardless of who won that election. Oh how times have changed.'
'>(CNN) Sen. John McCain pushed back Saturday night against President Donald Trump\'s reversal of an agreement to sign onto a statement by the G7 countries, saying that Americans would continue to stand with its historical allies.\n\n>"To our allies: bipartisan majorities of Americans remain pro-free trade, pro-globalization & supportive of alliances based on 70 years of shared values," the Arizona senator tweeted. "Americans stand with you, even if our president doesn\'t."\n\n>Earlier in the evening, Trump tweeted that Canadian prime minster Justin Trudeau was "meek" and "mild" and that his statements were "false."\n\n>Shortly after Trudeau said in an afternoon news conference that he was "happy to announce that we have released a joint communique by all seven countries" indicating that the US had signed on, Trump announced the US would reverse its decision and not join in the statement after all.\n'
'First and foremost, all the criticisms about McCain here are valid. That being said, I am glad he is speaking out with bold rhetoric. Also, probably on an unpopular note, as stupid as this is, it doesn’t seem like an impeachable offense. That is why voting for a democratic congress and making sure he never sets foot in the office after 2020 is so fundamentally important. That will send the boldest message. Lastly, trust me when I say mueller will provide us with many impeachable offenses,including obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice. '
'We need a president whose country’s best interest are more important than his own unilateral ego. Never thought I’d have to say that. \n\nLike it’s literally just HIM doing this. Not America, not Americans. Just this dumbfuck. '
'McCain is so brave when he’s not on the senate floor. '
'So he admits the actual POTUS doesn’t stand with our allies. And still he does nothing. Fuck off, John. '
"McCain, thank you. I think you would have made a wonderful president \\- even though some of your policies were problematic. As a middle\\-ground Canadian Liberal, you would have been a much better option that Trump. I think many Canadians were very sorry to hear about McCain's health, and Canadians will always love Americans*, it's the government we're sick of.*"
'As a European, I want to believe this, and on a good day, I do. Now here’s my problem. I am in an echo chamber, like most of us are. So regardless of what “most” Americans think, I’ll hear the things I want to hear. Social media have walled us off pretty well. The only way for me to really know if McCain is correct here, is America voting overwhelmingly Democrat in the midterms. Every 2 years Americans get to prove how they view the world, and last time was pretty bleak. Now one can talk about the electoral system all day, but the fact that last election did not wipe the floor with Trump implies to me that McCain may be a bit of an optimist here. America, you have a lot to prove. Just my 2 cents.'
'Sorry, but it doesn\'t seem like "America" *does* stand with the rest of the world or even its allies, if we look at the actions of your President, Congress and and a not insignificant percentage of business and citizens...\n\nHell, America doesn\'t even stand with *itself*.'
'I have not agreed with McCain on many things, but he loves our country. \n\nI will remember his thumbs down on the ACA vote for a long time. It’s hard to see some of these politicians as people, and truthfully, some are not. I think McCain has different vision for America because of his beliefs and not because of “LiBeRuL tears.” That is more respectable than Ted Cruz’s or Tom Cotton’s pandering ways.\n\nI hope he can turn a few heads a few more times before he passes.'
'Vast majority yes, but Republican Party is standing idle and complicit in this detrimental state of our country. '
'Mitch McConnell 2008: "My greatest priority is making Barack Obama a one-term President."\n\nMitch McConnell 2008-2016: "When we are in power our first step will be to repeal Obamacare."\n\nMitch McConnell 2017: "..."\n\nThat quotation and ellipses actually looks like the face he is always making hahahaha'
'And that should just about do it.  Get Collins or Murkowski and it\'s dead for good.  Another win for the good guys. \n\nMoney quote: https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=1D7F89BB-FF93-41A5-85B8-C87E3CCCC4CE\n\n>"We should not be content to pass health care legislation on a party line basis...I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal."\n\nEdit: I don\'t want my comment to be taken as we shouldn\'t keep pushing as hard as possible.  Rand Paul is a hard no right now, but I don\'t trust Rand Paul at all.  He\'s a no, only because this bill doesn\'t fuck over more people.  If the GOP could find a way to screw more people in this bill, Paul could switch.  Keep going after Murkowski & Collins as hard as possible.  \n\nEdit: Jimmy Kimmel response: https://twitter.com/jimmykimmel/status/911289521269989377\n\n>Thank you @SenJohnMcCain for being a hero again and again and now AGAIN'
"[McCain's full statement:](https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=1D7F89BB-FF93-41A5-85B8-C87E3CCCC4CE)\n\n>“As I have repeatedly stressed, health care reform legislation ought to be the product of regular order in the Senate. Committees of jurisdiction should mark up legislation with input from all committee members, and send their bill to the floor for debate and amendment. That is the only way we might achieve bipartisan consensus on lasting reform, without which a policy that affects one-fifth of our economy and every single American family will be subject to reversal with every change of administration and congressional majority.\n\n>“I would consider supporting legislation similar to that offered by my friends Senators Graham and Cassidy were it the product of extensive hearings, debate and amendment. But that has not been the case. Instead, the specter of September 30th budget reconciliation deadline has hung over this entire process.\n\n>“We should not be content to pass health care legislation on a party-line basis, as Democrats did when they rammed Obamacare through Congress in 2009. If we do so, our success could be as short-lived as theirs when the political winds shift, as they regularly do. The issue is too important, and too many lives are at risk, for us to leave the American people guessing from one election to the next whether and how they will acquire health insurance. A bill of this impact requires a bipartisan approach.\n\n>“Senators Alexander and Murray have been negotiating in good faith to fix some of the problems with Obamacare. But I fear that the prospect of one last attempt at a strictly Republican bill has left the impression that their efforts cannot succeed. I hope they will resume their work should this last attempt at a partisan solution fail.\n\n>“I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal. I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried. Nor could I support it without knowing how much it will cost, how it will effect insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it. Without a full CBO score, which won’t be available by the end of the month, we won’t have reliable answers to any of those questions.\n\n>“I take no pleasure in announcing my opposition. Far from it. The bill’s authors are my dear friends, and I think the world of them. I know they are acting consistently with their beliefs and sense of what is best for the country. So am I.\n\n>“I hope that in the months ahead, we can join with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to arrive at a compromise solution that is acceptable to most of us, and serves the interests of Americans as best we can.”"
"With Collins and Paul against it, and now McCain, I think we're in good shape. Hopefully Murkowski can join in too just to confirm it's death, but maybe McCain is speaking out to save her from making the decision and taking the heat? "
"Good for McCain. People mock him a lot, often rightfully so, but he actually was the vote against the last GOP bill and, if he sticks by this, is the vote against this one. And he's doing this in a manner which (i) saves the legislation of the guy who literally beat him for election and (ii) is doing it for good governance principles. He's also doing this against a bill sponsors and championed by his biggest ally and friend.\n\nIt is praiseworthy."
'Thank you Senator McCain. Thank you for putting your country above your party. '
"It's amazing how much a politician's votes change when he knows he'll never have to worry about getting re-elected."
'Please be the "dramatically voting \'no\'" McCain from the last bill\'s vote and not the "I can\'t support this publicly until it\'s time to vote lock-step with my party" McCain from the days of yore. '
"Never was a huge fan of his politics but after seeing him in Ken Burns' Vietnam Documentary smoking a cigarette,  saying how he loves his wife and that he hopes to see her soon, really puts in perspective the sacrifices he's made for our country. It infuriates me that he'll likely be criticized by Trump for sticking to his principles especially in the context of Trump stating he doesn't like people who were captured. Hope that this will give the GOP some semblance of what it takes to have a backbone and an openness to working with their democratic counterparts across the aisle. "
"Still...\n\nI'd feel A LOT better if Murkowski announced she were a 'NO' as well. "
'>We should not be content to pass health care legislation on a party-line basis, as Democrats did when they rammed Obamacare through Congress in 2009.\n\nYou mean passed with a 60 vote super majority and with committee hearings and amendments?\n\nWhile I appreciate his sentiment about not voting for horrific laws with none of these things, this is complete horseshit.\n\n '
'This makes it easier for Murkowski, and any other moderates who wish to exercise principle over party.'
"Keep it that way, John. Our shithead Governor Doug Ducey has thrown his support behind the bill (as well as Jeff Flake) and Ducey even admitted that they were still going over calculations to see how it would affect Arizona. Amazing. He fully supports a bill that he self-admittedly doesn't fully understand yet. Stay as a no, John. This will help your legacy tremendously."
'Good for him and good for us. '
'To be honest it blows my mind that people look at everything that the Republican Party is doing and they think "yup that\'s the group I align my beliefs with". I wish I would be alive when 100 years from now the history books write them down as scum. '
'It would be great if on Oct 1 the Democrats held a party outside on the lawn of Congress to, you know, celebrate.  (But I guess that would be too blatant.)'
'John McCain is a brave and good man who is not afraid to go against the grain.   I see in him now, strokes of wisdom not seen in Washington very often.  His illness seems to have rekindled his energy, his bravery, and his outlook on life.   I hope I could be half as brave under the same circumstances.   '
'IF he sticks to his word, I’m elated. \n\nKeep that brow furrowed, John!\n\nI’m patiently waiting for the ass nugget in office to hate tweet how McCain is single handedly ruining the party and how a hero who was not a POW would vote yes. And he’ll meet him after school to give him a wedgie.'
'"I like healthcare bills that weren\'t captured [by special interests]"'
"I like Presidents that aren't legislative losers"
'He seems to be thinking about the party, believing, as I do, that the republicans would only be hurting themselves by passing such a piece of garbage.  There are surely SOME republican voters that are not too stupid to notice when their party literally destroys their health care options just so the rich can get bigger tax breaks.  \n\nI figure when older Americans realize how drastically their health care costs will increase under this plan, some of them will finally wake up to the reality that the Republican party is working against their best interests..  '
"Man, I feel like people didn't like McCain for being wushy washy earlier on the other bill. But this may be the one redeeming member of the Republican Party? "
'I wonder if McCain would vote with the GOP if he was in better health and younger.  I believe more people vote their conscience when they are less likely to run for re-election, instead of going along with the party line BS.'
'McCain will not vote for a bad bill.  And this is a bad bill.'
'Way to go John McCain, stand up for what is right, stand up and protect the american people. Lets hope my Senator Jeff Flake has the guts to stand up and do the right thing and VOTE NO!\n'
'He’s not wrong, but as an AZ resident I will be writing to his office telling him to back his words up with real actions. Until he introduces a bill to protect Mueller, his words are just rhetoric'
'Thank you Senator McCain, please prove for us all one last time that you are in fact the true American patriot and hero that we all have always known you to be. \n\nOur country is under attack again, and we need you to defend us once again, this time more than ever before...Ever since you voted to save healthcare for millions of poor people and children you gave a lot of credibility to your character in my eyes. Taking a strong a principled stand against the would be tyrant in the oval office would cement you, at least in my eyes, for all time. '
"Hopefully McCain sticks with his guns on this and doesn't back down. Words are one thing but commitment is another, and knowing McCain..."
'I love hearing about how "very concerned" he, Flake, and Rubio are while they do nothing.'

"McCain is exceptional! All the other Republican spines are hanging out at a spine retreat in Vermont. Good luck 'murica, you're fucked."
"Otherwise he'll be like super concerned."
"Reminder: it's really only cause McCain doesn't have much longer to live that he grew some balls against Trump. Also he still has five years left on his term so he doesn't have to worry about being primaried. If neither were the case he'd be a little bitch just like every other GOP member of the Senate save for Jeff Flake. Trump is not the only problem, the GOP is too.  "
'Republicans sure do talk a lot, but when it comes down to it each and every one of these guys will walk the party line. '

'i would add that the entire democratic senate also played a small roll...the media in this country is absolutely crazy.\n\nThe entire republican party spends 8 years trying to take health care away from people, and then one old guy gets the credit for "saving" it?\n\nClean off your eyes folks, the dominant narrative is suspect.'

"Stupid article. Everyone who voted against it saved the ACA. However, the 3 Republicans voted against party lines so they're in the spotlight. Further than that McCain looked pretty sure he would vote for the bill then didn't. That's why he is in the news."
'Murkowski and Collins certainly deserve more credit. But I know I derive a ton of pleasure from McCain being in the "NO" column. He was praised just the other day by Trump for his "heroic" return to the senate. I can\'t wait to watch the GOP eat each other as the blame game takes hold. Maybe it\'s time for Mitch to go... '
'Well, in Washington they say - that John’s small heart grew three sizes that day. And then - the true meaning of compassion came through, and John found the strength of *ten* Johns, plus two!'
"I see no reason to believe McCain was bucking his party. It's just as likely that Republicans didn't want to pass anything. Now McCain is getting rave reviews and the GOP can go to their base and say they did what they could and pin their failure on McCain, who is unliked by the conservative base and is almost dead anyway.\n\nRepublicans put on big performances like this all the time, it allows them to control the media narratives and appeal to moderates. I don't think McCain was voting to save healthcare for people so much as he was voting to help the Republican Party save face. I see no reason to give him the benefit of the doubt. "
"To further add to Lisa Murkowski's badassery, she successfully won her senate seat in 2010 on a write in campaign after the republican party voted for someone else in the primary. "
"It cost McCain, who is not running for Senate again,nothing to cast this vote. \n\nIt cost Susan Collins almost nothing to cast this vote. Maine may be conservative but it's not crazy alt-right. \n\nThis vote cost Lisa Murkowski a lot. She was singled out and attacked by Trump in the press and on Twitter. The various thugs that are toadies for Trump came after her with flame throwers and jackhammers. She stood up. She took it. She voted her values and in what she considered to be the best interest of the country. \n\nShe didn't fold like Johnson or Graham or all the other men who promised to oppose the bill. \n\nCall Murkowski's senate office and thank her. \n\nShe deserves a pat on the back"

So what's the problem? "
'what I wrote to Senator Collins: \n\nThankyou Senator Collins for standing up against a terrifyingly incomplete health care bill. The United States now desperately you and your colleagues to reach across the aisle. Health care will take time to solve. You have common issues that are needed to be addresed such as drug prices gouging. Develop solutions to addres those issues and the american people will continue to grow and thrive. Personally I support a public option to create consistent availability and the government leverage to negotiate and keep healthcare costs lower. \n\nThankyou'
'All three deserve credit, but Collins is safe and McCain is terminally ill. Murkowski may have torched her career last night and saved hundreds of thousands of lives in the process. '
'While I would like to thank him for his reasoned, responsible vote, only his unreasonable, unconscionable vote allowed this vote to be reached in the first place.'
'Pretty crazy that voting to not murder millions of people makes you a hero now.'
"Yes, but we pretty much already knew Murkowski and Collins would vote against it. McCain's sudden defection is the noteworthy one. Murkowski and Collins tied up the vote and made the assist to allow McCain to score on this one, so they do deserve as much credit for the bill's death."
'"Obamacare," love it or hate it, was a very important first step towards efficient health care for all.  It\'s not a perfect system, but so many people use it, that it cant just be repealed.  Too many people rely on it now, so it is forcing something BETTER to come along, even though it hasn\'t yet.  Thank goodness there\'s something in place for people in need right now, regardless of pre-existing conditions.'
'A lot of activists on twitter are saying things like "congrats, your calls to your senators are what made this happen." Honest question, is that true? Seems like Collins and Murkowski were voting no the whole time, and McCain voted no bc the bill is a joke. Otherwise, total party line vote. Am I missing something?'
"Well, in Washington they say - that the McCain's small heart grew three sizes that day. And then - the true meaning of healthcare came through, and the McCain found the strength of *ten* McCains, plus two"
'How about this: the activist constituencies of Maine and Alaska should get the credit for this, as well as the rest of the grassroots surge across the country to save Obamacare.'
"I cannot believe what bitches the Republican voters are.  These are politicians they admired.  I have been in arguments with many Republicans over criticisms of Bush 1 and McCain.

All of my friends are liberal, but my family is conservative.\n\nI refused to snap at any of them, but there definitely was a line of dialogue at some point from them that either McCain needed to go into a quick remission to help pick a Supreme Court justice or he needed to head to the graveyard and get out of the way because he was a RINO.\n\nMy family wonders why I don't visit often. They have no empathy, sympathy, or care for anyone but themselves. It's all rot, and it needs to be dealt with. It's not just Trump, it's all of them."
"He is attempting to complete his takeover of the GOP.  So he has to debase those GOP leaders who have questioned or not followed his policies.

Different life experiences.”\n\n>...“He is in the business of making money and he has been successful both in television as well as Miss America and others.

'I don\'t agree with McCain on much politically and am not a fan of his "Maverick Senator" schtick. But even if you are in staunch opposition to what he stands for in that area, unless you\'re a classless colluding orange bastard, you can\'t really knock McCain for his service in the Armed Forces and you can\'t say that he doesn\'t love America. He\'s certainly more respectable than Trump. \n\nI personally enjoyed his interview on 60 Minutes and wish him the best in his battle with cancer. '
'\nIn an unearthed interview from 1997, Donald Trump claimed he was a “brave soldier” for avoiding STDs during his single years in the late ’90s.\n\n>“It’s amazing, I can’t even believe it. I’ve been so lucky in terms of that whole world, it is a dangerous world out there. It’s like Vietnam, sort of. It is my personal Vietnam.

'I will preface this by saying I don\'t agree with a lot of McCain\'s voting record. None the less I really have always respected him. Even when I was a teenager (34 now) he was someone who would work across the aisle if the goal was something he believed in, most notably campaign finance & pork barrel.\n\nPolitics is politics and it\'s a game he\'s had to play, from his presidential campaign having to compete with a then rising tea party to simply towing the party line at times.\n\nWhat strikes me is the Ted Kennedy comparison. Certianly a flawed man and politician, unable to make the jump to president,  and the more superficial shared disease later in life. I think John McCain is the Ted Kennedy of the Republican party. A reminder of the parties past, an underestimated old man, and when it\'s least expected: a catalyst for the future of the party. This perverse platypus the modern republican party has become must fill him with disgust but he,  imperfectly as any human, ultimately shows the path back to sanity.  \n\nI\'m so far left I\'m almost right. I hate the label "liberal" because it assumes I tolerate opinions that reduce people to numbers on a spread sheet. None the less I greatly respect John McCain, not because he believes what I believe but because of how he has approached what he believes. '

"Just to be clear: he voted to open debate on the bill.  The title is very misleading.  In his address to the Senate, he overtly said the following:\n\n> I voted for the motion to proceed to allow debate to continue and amendments to be offered. I will not vote for the bill as it is today. It's a shell of a bill right now. We all know that. I have changes urged by my state's governor that will have to be included to earn my support for final passage of any bill. I know many of you will have to see the bill changed substantially for you to support it."
"This feels like clickbait, he voted for debating the ACA replacement and voted against repealing it without a replacement in place.\n\nThat feels like a good approach, we should be debating any changes and we shouldn't repeal without something new in place."

'He voted yes on the motion to open debate on the existing bills.  He did not vote yes on a specific bill.'
"He only voted to have a discussion on it, the democrats immediately halted talking about the issues of Obamacare after the primaries for obvious reasons but it is something that needs serious work done or changed to make sure that Americans can get quality health care with lower costs and premiums that is achievable long term. McCain stated he wouldn't vote for the current replacement bill and that it needed a lot of bipartisan work. The constant slamming of him for voting for just discussion is pretty ignorant but whatever the masses will believe... "

'Ex-Republican here.\n\nI\'m old.  Like, SUPER old.  I saw "Star Wars" in a drive-in theater on it\'s original run.  I\'m talking OLD here, people.

[It was a thing.  Look it up.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_cooling)\n\nSo, when the Left first started talking about "Global Warming", a lot of us figured it was just the latest in the continuing cycle of "hippies bitching about the rest of us wearing shoes and eating meat."  \n\nAnd to be honest here guys, at first you could hardly blame us.  Especially when Al Gore came out with his "hockey stick chart" which, if taken literally, should have meant that we were all currently living on the surface of the sun.  I know a lot of you will disagree, but Gore did more to *hurt* the cause of climate change acceptance than he ever did to help it, in the eyes of Republicans.\n\nSo yes, Republicans were slow to accept climate change at first.  Many of us finally did.  Many, like me, left the GOP over their inability to acknowledge the obvious.  But regardless of if you accept their reasons or not, they *did* have reasons to be skeptical at first, and not all of those reasons were "Republicans are evil".'
"McCain was once an ardent supporter of Cap'n'Trade. Unfortunately his support dwindled in the wake of party pressure, it's good to see that he's now coming back to his original acknowledgment of the issue."

According to [IMF research](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X16304867), subsidies for fossil fuels, which include direct cash transfers, tax breaks, and free pollution rights, cost the world $5.3 trillion/yr; “While there may be more efficient instruments than environmental taxes for addressing some of the externalities, energy taxes remain the most effective and practical tool until such other instruments become widely available and implemented.” “Energy pricing reform is largely in countries’ own domestic interest and therefore is beneficial even in the absence of globally coordinated action.” '
"Can someone explain John McCain to me?  I don't understand him.  He's a maverick but he has extremely conservative economic beliefs.  He says things against his own party and his president, but then votes with them 90% of the time.  I guess his brush with death has given him a change of heart about things?  I want to like this guy because lately he's been pretty stand up.  But his voting record and belief system appear to actively fight each other."
"climate is changing, let's embrace nuclear! he gets partial credit, i guess. "
"I listened to his interview on CNN. It's actually better than the article even suggests. McCain was incredibly humble during the interview, I enjoyed hearing his words, actually considered it a breath of fresh air talking about his cancer, his state of happiness and pride in his life, how he wants to be remembered, and about climate change which he does, in fact, believe in."
'I noticed some on the right are starting to accept that the climate is changing but are strategically trying to draw out the debate on whether it is caused by human activity in order to put off making changes to energy policy. Powerful stuff, those oil company donations.'
"McCain is taking a brave literally last stand. It behooves everyone that cares about  their life as they know it to help him. Climate change is the enemy of republicans democrats and independents. If he is opening a door for dialogue let's take it before it is too late and Trump keeps whatever is left of the US for himself and the nazis that support him."
"hey guys I have this ~crazy~ idea\n\nhear me out\n\nback like.. hundreds of years ago we figured out that motion is conserved, okay?\n\nand if we take a whole bunch of molecules that were hiding inside of the earth (oil) and burn them (oil burned in oxygen makes CO2) we move a whole lot of molecules out of the earth and put them in the sky.\n\nif you shine light on molecules they will move. the motion is energy. MOTION IS CONSERVED.\n\nif you increase the number of things in the sky, and the sun shines on them, you will have more fucking energy (motion) and thus you will have more storms, more droughts, more floods, more whatever. MORE WEATHER. It is not a good thing.\n\nFocus on green technologies, not burning hydrocarbons for energy. Burning hydrocarbons for energy is STUPID. Hydrocarbons have MUCH better uses than burning. Like.. making plastics, making pharmaceuticals, making films and polymers, making all sorts of REALLY COOL things.\n\nEven if you don't believe in climate change (WHICH YOU SHOULD, because.. my god.. people predicted it over 100 years ago for fuck sake) you should believe in NOT WASTING HYDROCARBONS FOR BURNING.\n\nWind, tidal, solar, natural gas (some), oil (some), coal (some) and nuclear are the future."

'Well, to be fair, he has had to deal with the more important issue of "which black guy didn\'t stand at a football match during the national anthem", where the VP had to fly half way across the country twice to highlight that issue. How can we expect him to remember to deal with this as well?'

'How? This White House doesn’t apologize. You need to be aware of or care how your actions are interpreted to apologize. '
"To anyone out there that laughed at this joke, please step right up and explain what part of it was funny to you. I feel like I'm missing out on some comedy gold and I need just one person who got the joke to let me know what I missed. "
'While this was cruel and insensitive, in the grand scheme of things it didn\'t have to be this big a deal.  This idiot White House needs to identify the shit that it can make go away quickly and easily, from a Communications standpoint. \n\nYou don\'t even have to fire her.  You _should_, but you could have gotten out of it with a statement that talks seriously and soberly about decency, about McCain\'s honor, and "thoughts and prayers" for the Senator and his family, etc... **and** specific actions that are being taken with regard to this matter, and avoiding a repeat.  Examples:\n\n"We have spoken with her about this."\n\n"She has been disciplined."\n\n"She is no longer on the White House staff."\n\nAlso...\n\n"We have reminded the White House staff that their behavior should be above reproach, not only in public, but in meetings that seem to be private, because this is the people\'s house, and is is a privilege to work here.  And besides that, you never know what you say that might suddenly be known by the American people."\n\nOh yeah.  Never mind.  There\'s no way they could have done all that.  It is well beyond the capabilities of this Communications Department, and this White House.\n\nAnd this is why this White House is a lost cause.  They can\'t even handle the easy stuff.'
'He\'s absolutely right. We\'ve gotten used to it, but the White House definitely needs to apologize for that "joke".'
"Bernie's operating under the misguided pretense that the current White House administration apologizes at all. Pretty sure they've got a zero-tolerance policy. "
'The GOP hasn’t played the “Manners” game for years now, it’s taken advantage of the fact that Democrats still do.\n\nStop playing this game, idiots.'
"Why apologize when you can allow this story to take precedence over other ongoing topics which you would rather avoid?  The outrage circuit is where Trump does his best, his people absolutely love watching those they don't agree with melt down."
"I think I have an explanation for that, but the argumentation is pretty wonky. So.. here goes!\n\nAhem.. cuz they're dicks. "
"Why does this sub upvote any mental fart Sanders makes. Trump and his cohorts have made nothing but cruel, despicable and reprehensible remarks since they took over. This is nothing new, nor is it surprising anymore.\n\nMaybe Sanders could start explaining why Russians paid  for his ads, took over his campaign after Super Tuesday and why he continued to bash Clinton even though it was clear he couldn't win the primaries anymore. He is a big reason Trump and his idiots are in the White House in the first place."
'“Beyond my comprehension” is a pretty good microcosm for this administration and its actions. '
'I don\'t like McCain\'s politics, I enthusiastically voted against him in 2008, and I partially blame him for helping put us on the path to a Donald Trump presidency, **BUT neither Donald Trump nor anyone else in the White House is worthy of shining John McCain\'s shoes**. This whole administration is rotten to the core—top to bottom—and the people working for it, *all* of whom are clearly willing to debase themselves, have learned from their "leader" (a term used very loosely) that it\'s okay to behave like animals.'

Kasowitz, was taking an adversarial approach to the Russia investigation. The president’s lawyers were digging into potential conflict-of-interest issues for Mr. Mueller and his team, according to current and former White House officials, and news media reports revealed that several of Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors had donated to Democrats.\n\n>Mr. Mueller could not legally have considered political affiliations when making hiring decisions.

"I'm sure a lot of people would get glee from watching that, but I find it kind of pathetic that this is where we're at. The President is bragging about his IQ like some idiot on Tinder.

'Well, that isn\'t settled case law, so no, he doesn\'t.\n\nThe Constitution provides no limits on pardons other than that it cannot be used to pardon someone from impeachment and it can only be used to pardon "offenses against the United States."  That has been held to mean that contempt of Congress is not pardonable (see *ex parte Grossman*), but otherwise, there is no such thing as an unpardonable crime.\n\nHowever, there is a longstanding judicial theory that no man can be his own judge, which is so important it has its own Latin phrase: "Nemo iudex in causa sua."  Since pardoning is taking upon the executive the act of being the judiciary, one could reasonably argue that self-pardons run afoul of judicial history, and that the Founders - many of whom were lawyers - would have found it inconceivable that someone would try to pardon himself.  No president has ever tried, so it\'s never actually been sorted out in court, but courts would likely land on the side of tradition here.\n\nTL;DR: Trump *might* have that right, but it\'s not absolute, and it\'s not settled.'
"Let's take a step back.  WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU EVEN SAY THAT IF YOU WEREN'T TRYING TO PRIME THE IDEA?\n\nJesus fucking christ, youre the president, and your brilliant legal opinion is you are literally above the law as long as you legally admit the crime? See how that works out for you."

'I am very liberal and hate on Trump as much as anyone, but I have a genuine question. When did "going in for a kiss" become sexual harassment, the same sexual harassment that is used to describe people that grope coworkers or make inappropriate sexual comments to subordinates? I understand no one should be coerced into doing something against their desires, romantically, sexually, or otherwise. However, it feels like basic gestures are now considered harassment, including trying to kiss someone after something you perceived to be a date.\n\nWhose first kiss with a romantic partner was overtly consensual? Did I miss the decision that you must explicitly ask your date for consent before attempting a normal kiss, and if you don\'t, you are a sex offender or have to resign your job? People make reads and sometimes they are wrong. She declined the kiss, their lives went on no worse for wear. I am genuinely curious if the first time people kiss on a date, they ask for permission like, "I would like to kiss you, is that ok?" and "Yes, you may kiss me". Maybe they do, and the zeitgeist has changed from when people took a chance and got turned down or not.\n\nAnyway, I just feel like there are plenty of actual sexual offenses by Trump, or anyone, that can be attacked, and that attempting a kiss a single time that gets turned down is awkward, but not sexual harassment. Like I said, perhaps that is an outdated opinion.\n\nEdit: I am trying to respond to everyone, but I think there are some important details that are being assumed, rather than basing your judgement on the information presented in the article.\n\n1) He may not have been married yet, as per the article. The uncertainty of when the event happened makes this criticism difficult at this time (a 2-year range is very broad). \n\n2) It does not say if it was a professional setting, a casual lunch, or a combination. Workplace romances can and do happen, so that idea is not completely impossible, nor does it appear he was using his position to coerce her, from the information in the article. \n\n3) Yes he was in power. No that doesn\'t make everything he does exploitation of power. He made a move, it got turned down, that was it. He didn\'t keep trying, he didn\'t badger her after, as far as we know.'

'Finally, was 14 open investigations not enough for this to happen sooner? Of course Trump broke the news himself on Twitter. '
'The turnover rate of this adminstration is worse than your local pizza place, what a sham.'
'Ugh. A small victory in a mountain of shit. '
"Scott Pruitt was under 16 investigations.  Was there a government agency that *wasn't* investigating him?  I think even the Smithsonian had accused him of something. "
"I'd like a big list going over every single resignation and arrest in this administration. "
"One of the most infuriating parts of this that no one is talking about is that he been actively replacing scientists with lobbyists on the scientific advisory committee. That's right, removing all the scientists from a scientific advisory committee and replacing them with people who's skills are: talking to people and spending money."
'Good. Now prosecute him.'
'How can it be that the guy in charge of the EPA stood directly fucking opposite of what the EPA was created for in the first place? The worst person in that position since its creation. Could it mean the swamp is finally being drained? Nope, Trumps next person in line for the job is a coal lobbyist go figure. '
'92% upvoted, at 50,000 points. This may be the one issue that both sides nearly unanimously agree on: Scott Pruitt, and the ways in which he should go fuck himself.'
'I bet he resigned because something else is about to be exposed. '
'So, who is worse that Scott Pruitt?  Beause that is the guy Trump will put up next.  '
'Now he gets investigated, charged with corruption and goes to jail right? Right???'
'Now if he eats shit and dies I’ll know for sure that that genie that gave me 3 wishes was legit! '
"I will remind you guys that we only just recently found out that Pruitt wanted Trump to fire Sessions and give him the job as AG. So don't celebrate just yet until this guy well and truly fucks off from the administration entirely."
'This guy needs to serve prison time.'
'If I’ve learned anything in the past year and a half it is that the replacement will likely be worse than Pruitt. '
'The way I see this going is now Trump leaves the post vacant for awhile citing confirmation battle concerns before simply shuddering the EPA entirely. '
"My takeaway on why this is such big news is this.  Scott Pruitt was the most corrupt government official in an administration of people desperately trying to one up each other for most corrupt.  \n\nBut at least now he can't be AG. "
'In to replace him: the literal devil \n\nIt will be like Bolton level replacement'
'So if you are wondering why 2 Republican house members are asking Mueller to step down...its because Trump looks really guilty. And this is just the unclassified things.'
"The most damning part of this whole thing is that he insisted the meeting was about adoptions. If he had said anything else it wouldn't look nearly as bad. As it is, it looks like the meeting was definitely discussing lifting the Magnitsky Act and was likely attempted collusion. There really doesn't seem to be a legitimate explanation."
'It was just a dad helping his poor, 39-year-old millionaire kid.'
"Man the centipedes are out in force today. I guess this story has got them booty-tickled.\n\nI don't care what you think about the entirety of the Russia story. Its pretty clear theres some amateur-hour level media manipulation thats originating from the Oval Office. I don't care whos President, if they're this sloppy I want them the fuck out of there.\n\nAt least Clinton and Bush had good handlers who could write their policies for them while they just sat back and grinned.\n\nThis guy though...\n\nOof."
"This story was out almost a month ago, same day the statement was released. It was denied by multiple Trump sycophants through various methods.\n\nIt took a month for the coverup to fall apart.\n\nThis doesn't bode well for the other coverups..."
"So...shouldn't there be protests or something like that? Shouldn't people start taking to the streets at this point? When South Korea found out about their president's corruption, the people forced her to resign. Why isn't the same thing happening in the US? "
"Time after time we hear stories about him being either directly implicated for this or directly implicated for that. I'm at the point now that it's nothing more than noise at this point and that's sad. With everything swirling around how is he still in power?"
'Now? He already was in firing Comey.  '
"[The President Dictated His Son's Misleading Statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPqRIFlbfWQ)"
"25th Amendment people. Mike Pence has his own set of problems, but Americans don't need a CROOKED PRESIDENT for the next 4 years. Wake up Republicans, if you sit back and do nothing, this will come back to bite you."
'It\'s funny how we\'ve gone from "Stupid Watergate" to "Stupid Iran Contra coverup"'
"Anyone who's ever looked into Trump's business practices and contacts (Soho hotel!!!) knows it's only a matter of time until he goes down...**and the GOP knows this too!**\n\nThe GOP's plan is to implement as many unpopular policies benefitting the top 1% as possible...and then blame it on Trump. And Trump is too egotistical and stupid to realise this. \n\nTrump doesn't understand politics or foreign policy...neither does he care about it. He cares bout two things, Trump and money with little regard for stuff like ethics. Ultimately, this will be his downfall.\n\nWho else knows what a crook Trump is? **Major foreign leaders** who aren't rolling out the red carpet...Germany...the UK...hell, France hosted him but Macron was way more confrontational than he'd been against Obama. \n\nThose countries have fairly capable intelligence agencies, they **KNOW** Trump is crooked...but they can't interfere without being seen as trying to influence US politics. But while they can't just come out openly due to diplomatic/political reasons, they also don't have to kiss his ass. "
'Funny, I saw this title and thought it was about the lawsuit against fox for the fake Seth Rich story. I can literally see a headline saying the president is directly implicated in covering up a crime, and not know which story that refers to.'
"Any guesses on how the Trumpers are going to spin this? It's getting past absurdity and reaching pure insanity with how brainwashed his followers are. "
'What a fucking idiot '
"At this point, I hope everyone's getting an air-tight demolition of this whole mess so there's no question when he's gone - HE'S GONE. I want all of those buildings to have to be renamed and maybe some prison time. I don't want this to end in a shrug and The Apprentice returns to NBC."
"now?   \n\nwhat about that time he admitted he fired the fbi director in attempt to block the investigation? are we just pretending that wasn't the fucking president admitting to obstruction of justice? "
'Yet *another* Nixon-esque paranoid megalomaniac desperately trying to cover his tracks?  \n\nWhat did you expect from the Republican party.  '
"Incredibly, Sanders just contradicted Trump's lawyer on his involvement in drafting Trump Junior's statement on the Russia meeting. This is jaw dropping."
'Trump will die in jail.'
"It's maddening that the *only* thing my coworker is focused on with this whole story is who leaked the information. Not that Donald helped his son fabricate an excuse, but who leaked that information. JFC"
'Hell yeah he is'
"Fuck it.  I'm driving to DC at the crack of dawn."
"The wife and I have a vacation scheduled.\n\nWe were going to go spend a week at the lake cabin.\n\nNow were going to spend it in DC and protest every night.\n\nCRUSH THE BUG MENACE!\n\nI'm doing my part!\n\nDo you want to know more?"
'I has no idea this was going on, and I read a lot of news. Wtf. Wish I could be there...'
'Get him the fuck out of office.'
'I had no idea there were anti-trump protests outside the white house. Way to go, Americans! a little bit of faith restored.'
'Keep the pressure on the scumbag!!'
'Vote, protest and boycott.\n\nJoin us at /r/consumerstrike and be part of our 5 brand boycott.'
'Keep it up, guys! Democracy is something worth fighting for.'
'"hundreds of people" are protesting, it should be thousands or more. The United States of America is the laughing stock of the world at the moment, stand up and defend yourselves against this bullshit before it\'s too late.'
"Just wondering, do the protesters actually think Trump cares? I feel like they are just wasting their time... like there's no way in fuck he cares at all that like 50 people are angry and outside yards away. They inconvenience him in no way... and are clearly not the demographic he's trying to convince to re-elect him. \n\nedit: Like getting mad/sad that 50 completely random people with uncertified and uninformed opinions getting mad would be like getting mad that a random redditer called you a loser."
'Meanwhile every other country seems to get hundreds of thousands of people to assemble in protest of their leaders...'
"I'm about to cancel my road trip plans and reallocate the funds to go to DC to photograph the events that are happening. "
'I get the feeling a lot of laws are going to be made for future presidents based off all the crap Trump gets away with.'
"So don't protect him then."
'In the spirit of smaller government, I vote for leaving them unprotected. \n\n'
"I wouldn't work for free, regardless of any oath I took. If I took an oath for any job, I would expect the unspoken part of that oath is that I get paid to uphold it. If I were a secret service agent I wouldn't be working for free in a position where I'm expected to give my life to protect someone. "
'No pay no body guards then '
'This is fucking ridiculous.  Local and state organizations are essentially losing funding so Trump can go play golf. '
"Wow. It's almost as if he's bad with money or something."
"Not just a large family, but a large family that refuses to be anywhere near each other. Y'know, because they're incapable of love."
'How long before he blames it on Obama and his lifestyle and tries to cancel Secret Service protection for previous presidents?'
"Since this is the government, I imagine their budget is similarly set up like the military. They have a pot of money to spend before EOY. The budget they were allocated would have been the same as last fiscal year or what they spent previously. If they were truly out of money they can request additional money. This happens all the time. \n\nThe secret service are still being paid. People need to quit acting like this is the same when you can't pay bills because your account is at zero. They get more money.  But this proved that they are over budget compared to previous fiscal years. Keep in mind that their budget covered 2 Presidents, and Trump's drained what was left almost 2 months before the end of the fiscal year.\n\nEdit: goddamn people I am not defending Trump. Just saw a bunch of people talking out of their ass on how a departments budget works at a federal level"

'[Trump was price-gouging the Secret Service on their space in Trump Tower.](http://www.thedailybeast.com/report-secret-service-leaves-trump-tower-after-dispute-with-trump-organization) They had to decamp to trailers on the street because they could no longer afford the rent inside the building.'
'And this is just a small example of how our deficit will balloon.'
'Oh man the amount of fucking SHIT any future democrat president will be able to get away with because of this fat piece of shit will be amazing, the republicans can not arrest the democrats on anything after the trump presidency because they are the ones who set the standard haha\n'
"And what's forgotten is the Secret Servive has to pay Trump businesses to rent out rooms, golf carts, etc.\n\nBravo ppl.  Drain the swamp indeed."
'What a fiasco this guy is.  How many absurd hypocrisies can the GOP defend before they break?'
"The family size is hardly the issue and will just lead to some people defending him as seen on the comments here. It's the traveling. That is why he is on pace to break 8 years of what was spent on Obama in just a single year. His travel costs are insane because he travels so dang much for nonessential travel."

As he chips away at the foundation of America bit by bit we lose more of ourselves everyday. **We as Americans could stop this. If... we acted together.**'
'You know what we fucking need? A change in the perception of government and our relationship with it. We need a government that believes its function is to solve societal problems, not one that thinks government _is_ a problem. Government is what happens when a group of people live together and come up with rules that are mutualistic to all involved. This whole anti government thing that Republicans run on is antisocial at its core. If you don\'t want to live in a society, you should just buy your next ticket to a deserted island and live alone with no government. For the rest of us, government is you and me coming together to make our society better and this is why we need to protect our institutions from those who would do it harm. In the words of the best president we\'ve had so far in the 21st century, "elections have consequences".'
"NPR is a good news source but it has gone soft in recent years. They can probably survive on their loyal contributor base. PBS is another matter. Their news is harder and they are more dependant on public funds.\n\nIn the same budget Trump calls for the closing of the National Endowment for the Humanities. He's a real troglodyte, uncouth and willfully ignorant of culture, science, and the arts. The path he has chosen is a disaster for our nation."
"The people should propose eliminating any fund for Trump's shitty golf game."
"Well.. isn't it interesting how he tries to control the media.. all reporting he doesn't like is fake news.. "
'So wait, Trump had a "ceremony" where it was a crowd gathered at the White House to play the National Anthem?  That\'s some nationalistic shit right there. '
"Can we please start kneeling during the anthem as fans in the crowd. That would piss Trump's shithead base off and there is NOTHING they could do. Please let's start doing this!"
'This is going to happen in the stands of every NFL game. The owners really fucked up, now the spotlight is 100x brighter. '
'I heard that someone asked a "fan" "who was the quarterback that won the superbowl?" and no one could answer.  Somebody just invited the entire WH to listen to some patriotic music so he didn\'t look even more like a BIG LOSER that NO ONE wants to meet or be seen with.'
"> Man takes knee during national anthem at Giant Toddler's Pity Party.\n\nFTFY"
'> At The White House. One guy in the audience took a knee during the national anthem at President Trumps celebration of America no Eagles event. Left right after - didn’t wanna talk\n\nCertainly got the headlines he wanted. '
'So Trump complained about paid crowds and protestors during the whole election and now he has a paid crowd for his "Patriotism" event?\n\nThis is the Bizarro universe.\n\n'
"Trump can't even pledge allegiance to his wife, let alone the country he sold out for personal gain."
"What a true patriot. I'm so fucking sad he was the only one."
'Trump says about the crowd size being big - "actually larger than we anticipated" \n\nBut wait a minute, this is an event the WH organised so they invited everyone who was there. You can\'t just turn up at the White House and go to an event, as everyone there needs to have passed even minimal background checks. \n\nSo no it is impossible for it to be larger than anticipated - the only possible scenarios are either it was exactly what you anticipated or less than you anticipated due to people who had been invited dropping out through illness.'
'>Earlier Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders blamed the Eagles for the last-minute change and referred to it as “a political stunt” by the organization.\n\nShe really is despicable.'
'Political stunt on the behalf of the Eagles? Bullshit. The political stunt is the president forcing himself upon the NFL. '

'I didn\'t see mention in this thread yet, but THIS is a VERY big fucking deal right here. Here\'s the real action:\n&nbsp;\n\n "The government notes that the official forwarded defendant PAPADOPOULOS\'s email to another Campaign official (without including defendant PAPADOPOULOS) and stated: "Let[\']s discuss. We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips. It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal."'
'holy shit, just read through Papadopoulos’s Stipulation and Plea agreement. this is actually fucking huge. almost a smoking gun, and bullet casings galore. this guy tried to set up a meeting between trump and the russian government after learning that russia had dirt on clinton, and offered to meet with the russian government himself. important thing here is that he was provided knowledge of russia having dirt on clinton *after* it was learned that Papa was in fact going to be a member of/advisor to Trump’s campaign. Anyways, he was told by trump campaign officials *to go ahead*. he was given permission to meet with the fucking russian government to discuss dirt on clinton. that in and of itself is attempted fucking collusion under the guise of “foreign relations discussions”. and you know why that meeting between papa and russia never happened? BECAUSE IT DIDNT FUCKING NEED TO, BECAUSE TRUMP JR, KUSHNER, AND MANAFORT HOSTED THAT MEETING INSTEAD. AND WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW NOW THAT THE TALKING POINTS BROUGHT TO THE MEETING BY THE RUSSIAN LAWYER WERE PROVIDED BY THE FUCKING KREMLIN.\n\nIf you still think Trump’s public call to Russia to find Clinton’s missing emails was “just a joke” after all this, you’re delusional. There was absolutely a concentrated effort to collude with the russian government to influence the election in Trump’s favor. It’s now just about connecting the dots between Papadopoulos and the rest of the administration, which I think Muellers already done some of, as the documents mention “campaign officials” that encouraged communication between Papa and Russia, without mentioning specific names of those campaign officials. \n\nWatch out Trumplets, Muellers comin’ for ya.'

Whitefish also charges nightly accommodation fees of $332 per worker and almost $80 per day for food.\n\n* I just did the math, basically a collection of buddies (all subcontractors) from the Montana area are gonna be making at least  $2,720 a day in pay (conservative estimate of 8.5 hrs a day for 5 days a week), $330 in accommodation a day (7 days) and $80 a day in food.

We follow the rule of law, which means that we follow procedures and we reserve judgement. We complete our investigations and we evaluate all of the relevant evidence, before we reach any conclusion. That\'s how the American people expect their Department of Justice to operate and that is how our department is going to operate.

Because it creates the false expectation that this is an investigation into Trump\'s overall impeachability, that it remains an open question, and hence provides cover to politicians who are taking a feckless "wait and see" attitude. \n\nWe must Impeach Trump now, because of several dozen different things he\'s already done that are impeachable and his gross unfitness of character that is now privately obvious even to his most stalwart supporters.

"> President Donald Trump pressed senior aides last June to devise and carry out a campaign to discredit senior FBI officials after learning that those specific officials were likely to be witnesses against him as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, according to two people directly familiar with the matter.\n\n> In testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee on June 8, recently fired FBI Director James Comey disclosed that he spoke contemporaneously with other senior bureau officials about potentially improper efforts by the president to curtail the FBI’s investigation of alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\n> Not long after Comey’s Senate testimony, Trump hired John Dowd, a veteran criminal defense attorney, to represent him in matters related to Mueller’s investigation.\n\n> In discussions with at least two senior White House officials, Trump repeated what Dowd had told him to emphasize why he and his supporters had to “fight back harder,” in the words of one of these officials.\n\n> The FBI officials Trump has targeted are **Andrew McCabe**, the current deputy FBI director and who was briefly acting FBI director after Comey’s firing; **Jim Rybicki**, Comey’s chief of staff and senior counselor; and **James Baker**, formerly the FBI’s general counsel. Those same three officials were first identified as possible corroborating witnesses for Comey in a June 7 article in Vox. Comey confirmed in congressional testimony the following day that he confided in the three men.\n\nYeah, that's more obstruction and adds *even further* to what is now a clear pattern of behavior.  And Rybicki just quit recently.\n\n> In a brief conversation this afternoon, Dowd denied the accounts of administration officials contained in this story as “flat out wrong,” but he also refused to discuss what details were incorrect. “My advice to the president is confidential,” he told Foreign Policy.\n\n> “You don’t know me…,” he added, “and you don’t know what I communicated to the President and what I did not.”\n\nConvincing and quite professional denial!"

It turned to:\n\n    US: 70%\n    UK: 10%\n    Soviet Union: 20%\n\nSo, the intentional spreading of fake news and propaganda in France by the US government had 50% of the country change their mind on the back of false information. It is not just small subsets of \'dumb people\' that get influenced by fake news. It is the majority of the population. Do you want the majority of the population voting on something based upon them being fed false information?\n\nThat is why sharing deliberately false news is bad. Not just twisting shit. Out and out fake news to manipulate people.\n\nAnd we have their admission, which is enough. No jury will find them \'not guilty\'.\n\nNot just this, but think about all those people that say "North Korea claimed their leader got 18 holes in one" or something like that. News made up by an Australian journalist (who admitted he did it), but repeated as fact.\n\nLiterally EVERYBODY is swayed by fake news, which is why there needs to be tight restrictions on political news in the US just like there is in the UK (opinion pieces clearly labelled, for instance)'

"From the Slate report: \n\n>Daniels told me she’d gone to Trump’s hotel room after meeting him at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada in 2006. There they’d begun a sexual relationship, which continued for nearly a year. They’d met in New York and more than once in Los Angeles. In early 2007, Trump had invited her to a party to promote Trump Vodka, where she was photographed. He’d also invited her to his Miss USA pageant that year.\n\n>In our conversations, Daniels said she was holding back on the juiciest details, such as her ability to describe things about Trump that only someone who had seen him naked would know. She intimated that her view of his sexual skill was at odds with the remark attributed to Marla Maples.\n\n>She didn’t allege any kind of abuse, insisting she was not a victim. The worst Trump had done, she said, was break promises she’d never believed he would fulfill. She claimed he’d offered to buy her a condo in Tampa, Florida, and that he’d said he wanted to feature her as a contestant in an upcoming season of Celebrity Apprentice. Daniels, who is far from naïve, says she did not take him seriously, but Trump had insisted his NBC contract let him do whatever he wanted on the show. Eventually, she said, he’d told her the network wouldn’t allow her on the air because of the objections of an executive’s wife.\n\n>Daniels said she had some corroborating evidence, including the phone numbers of Trump’s longtime personal assistant Rhona Graff and his bodyguard Keith Schiller, with whom she said she would arrange rendezvous. While she did not share those numbers with me, I did speak to three of Daniels’ friends, all of whom said they knew about the affair at the time, and all of whom confirmed the outlines of her story.\n\nEdit: It is being [confirmed by WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2018/01/16/adult-film-star-reportedly-spoke-to-journalist-in-2016-about-trump-settlement-fearing-he-wouldnt-pay-up/?__twitter_impression=true&__twitter_impression=true&tid=sm_tw&utm_term=.9366099351a9) that she talked to the Slate editor. \n\nEdit 2: Holy shit, a [Fox reporter](http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/16/media/fox-news-stormy-daniels-trump/) had on the record confirmation of a sexual relationship, but the story was killed. \n\n>One of the network's reporters, Diana Falzone, had filed a story in October 2016 about an alleged sexual relationship between Clifford and Trump, people familiar with the matter said.\n\n>Falzone had an on-the-record statement from Clifford's manager at the time, Gina Rodriguez, confirming that her client had engaged in a sexual relationship with Trump, three of these people said, and Falzone had even seen emails about a settlement.\n\n>But the story never saw the light of the day, to the frustration of Falzone, two of the people said.\n\n\n"

'Well at least his name will be synonymous with greed, stupidity, corruption, and laziness ineptitude. '
"I wouldn't doubt that the US Government was this corrupt in previous years, such as the Nixon administration, just that it's *flaunting* corruption so much that it's making people angry and upset."
"Like we didn't know that going into this shit storm? I'll tell you what though. Trump's administration is probably the only that has met the expectation and then exceeded that going into the White House."
"It's rather hard to deny it."
"The President, who blew the cover of an Israeli intel operation, asked the Russian's to hack Clinton's emails, fired the head of the FBI and countless other blunders is all a sudden concerned about the national security implications of a memo?"
'The Democrat\'s memo was cleared by the FBI for release to the public. What does Trump not want us to see?\n\nEDIT: \n\nRIP my Inbox.\n\nThe DoJ did have some suggestions for some parts that could be changed/redacted... but, so far as I know, they didn\'t suggest that the entire memo should be blocked, nor did they *publicly* denounce the memo (as they did for Nunes).\n\nAside from that, Trump *could* have released it *with* the DoJ recommended changes, and the WH could just say, "Well this is just what the independent DoJ recommended."'
"I knew it. There was no way that Trump would allow this to happen. Now we just got to wait for another Pentagon Papers event to happen. I'm putting money on the Washington Post and New York Times as the two places that will get this leaked to."
'So this is the trap Schiff set:\n\nPut out a memo that criticizes the Nunes memo, and is loaded with classified/sensitive info.  You know they have to redact it, so play up what’s getting redacted.  He’s not stupid enough to block the release of the document altogether, but you get to play the game of “what is he hiding?”\n\nThe trap that Trump tripped was even worse: Don’t release it at all.  So now instead of debating “why did he redact [such and such passage]?” It’s now, “what’s in here that he doesn’t want the public to see, even redacted?”\n\nDemocrats should let this play out over the weekend, let him get defensive.  In the meantime, work with Feinstein’s staff or the agencies to clean it up for details that actually do need to be redacted.  Then dump it on Monday morning, into the Congressional Record.  Constitutionally, the President can’t punish them for entering it into the Record, instead of, say, to the Washington Post. '
'Trump blocking the release of the Democratic memo just goes to show that you are what you grab.'
'This is propaganda warfare, plain and simple.  \n\nThere is no way that Trump should have the final say in the release of something that legally refutes the so-called "proof" of his innocence in the Russia investigation.'
'I can tell you how bad this is.  I have friends in the military that have always tried to stand up for everything Trump does.  I have had 3 of them text me already saying something along the lines of "OK, he might be guilty." or "Ok, I think he is hiding something."\n\n\n\n\n'
'Of course he blocked it - he thinks he’s doing the right thing.  \n\nThe rest of the sane and civilized world recognize it as him hiding something.'
"The country is in an interesting loop where Trump does something outrageously biased, and it is met by naive and overstated shock by the country. It's getting old. It's like watching a toddler be amazed by a bad magic trick over and over again. "
'This memo can still get released in a variety of ways\n\n1. Go to House floor for a vote to over-rule the WH\n2. Get read into the record on the House floor\n3. Get leaked. '
"of course he did, he's guilty af"
'And we are still IGNORING the fact Trump REFUSED to enact sanctions on Russia despite the senate vote 98-2 in favor of sanctions against Russia over the election meddling. '
"This should come as no shock.\n\nI hope the Dems were expecting it and have a plan B in place. They couldn't have gone through the trouble to let him have the final say."
'So in other words, Trump is still an ass hat with the face of a melting turd.'
'Coward in Chief'
'Where the fuck is Wikileaks during all of this?\n\nOh yeah...'
"Wow. What an idiotic move. \n\nTrump's fear of and complete double standard with the Schiff Memo—*despite* the utterly predictable backlash of suppressing it—tells you everything you need to know about how thoroughly it must destroy the Nunes Memo (though to be fair, the Nunes Memo is pretty good at refuting itself).  \n\nThis only increases the power of the Schiff memo—which will eventually get out in some form or another—by making it into the memo Trump didn't want you to read and raising the obvious followup question: what is Trump hiding?\n\nCombover Caligula is pure id. He can't think even one step ahead.\n"
'Oh look, the culmination of the "we tried" moment.\n\nThis memo was never going to see the light of day. If it gets released in a classified format, I have no doubt that the classified bits will have been cherry picked to both neuter the memo and make Schiff look bad.\n\nAll part of the process of "maintaining power by any means necessary" folks.'
'Beautiful. Only a truly innocent man would attempt to block information about his own criminal investigation.'
'Stop expecting Trump to do the right thing.  Or the decent thing.  Or even the comprehensible thing'
'Well... pretty obvious what happened here.\n\nThe republicans voted to release because they secretly knew the Schiff memo exposes the Obama Clinton Kaepernek baby murders.\n\nTrump wants to release because he has the best transparency believe me but now Rosenstein, who I used to love but now I hate, is blocking it because he is deep state!\n\n36DD Twister with grandma, son!\n\n\n\nSarcasm. This was all sarcasm'
'This is ridiculous. The right would have literally been taking up arms and out in the streets if shit like this had gone down under Obama’s administration.'
'Trump supporters: Ask yourself how furious you would be if Obama did this. Think back to when shit like this used to piss you off.\n\nRealize how far Fox News has made you drift from that patriotic integrity you felt you had.\n\nThey have made you feel totally cool with another country souring our democracy \n\nThey have made you attack the FBI\n\nAttacking the NSA, CIA and now up next the State Dept.'

'> The lawsuit echoes a similar legal tactic that the Democratic Party used during the Watergate scandal. In 1972, the DNC filed suit against former president Richard Nixon’s reelection committee seeking $1 million in damages for the break-in at Democratic headquarters in the Watergate building.\n\n> The suit was denounced at the time by Nixon’s Attorney General, John Mitchell, who called it a case of “sheer demagoguery” by the DNC. But the civil action brought by former DNC chair Lawrence F. O’Brien was **ultimately successful**, yielding a $750,000 settlement from the Nixon campaign that was reached on the day in 1974 that Nixon left office.\n\nWell, look at that.'

">Last month, House Intelligence Committee Republicans said they found no evidence that President Trump and his affiliates colluded with Russian officials to sway the election or that the Kremlin sought to help him — a conclusion rejected by the panel’s Democrats.\n\nIt wasn't just rejected-- Adam Schiff _literally said that they had evidence of collusion_, and it was ignored and the investigation closed.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/repadamschiff/status/975088606283956225?lang=en"
"Several interesting things to discuss here:\n\nSuing a foreign nation in an apparently civil case. Is it likely that it will work? When has it in the past?\n\n>Suing a foreign country may present legal challenges for the Democrats, in part because other nations have immunity from most U.S. lawsuits. The DNC’s complaint argues Russia is not entitled to the protection because the hack constituted a trespass on the party’s private property. \n\nI wonder if that will stand up in court. Even if it does, can't Russia just refuse to respond?\n\nSimilar questions for Wikileaks, a foreign entity as far as I know.\n\nAnother question: Why is the DNC doing this before the investigations are over? Do they know more than the public? Is it an attempt by them to do their own fact finding via court proceedings?\n\nMore interesting bits:\n\n>The suit contains previously undisclosed details, including that the specific date when the Russians breached the DNC computer system: July 27, 2015, according to forensic evidence cited in the filing.\n\n>The analysis shows the system was breached again on April 18, 2016. The hackers began siphoning documents and information from DNC systems on April 22.

How much of the American international reputation is the GOP ready to give up to keep the presidency? For every day, heads of states, citizens of countries, allied and enemies of The United States, are laughing at Trump first, the GOP second and your citizens third.\n\nHaving elected, and kept this president will hurt America for a long time. You are losing international credibility. Credibility at NATO, at the UN, the international markets. When Trump-time is over you have decades to repair what he has done. If it's democrats or republicans who do it you need to do it either way. You need to make back credibility and that takes a lot more time and effort than destroying it. Trump has caused many years worth of sabotage to your international standing. Germany is moving forward. China is. Russia of course is. Even Great Britain while in a state of their own chaos is picking up pieces of international gain that the US is just dropping on the ground while Trump does what Trump does.

'Hardest working president ever. No vacations! What a putz. '
'Normally when the president "goes on vacation" you know they really aren\'t totally off the job the whole time. I\'m not so sure I can believe that with Trump. He probably legitimately believes the president can just stop working for half a month'
'"The trip could partially be related to the fact that the government is replacing the heating and cooling system in the White House\'s West Wing, so everyone who works there will need to leave by the end of the week, according to the AP."\n\nGuys, I can\'t blame Trump for getting the heck out of there.  D.C. weather is nightmarish.'
"At this point, good. Let his ass go on vacation the rest of his term. There's a smaller chance he'll fuck up the country that way. "
"When was Obama, Bush and Clinton's first vacation and how long was it? I wanna know before I get outraged "
'But when Barack Obama took his few vacations a year he was so lazy according to the Republican Party.'
"New Jersey isn't perfect, but it doesn't deserve this . . . "
'He is more lazy than Barack Obama'
"I've been working non-stop for the last 9 months and only have 3 days of paid time off. Fuck this guy "
"Didn't he make fun of Obama for golfing too much?"
">The trip could partially be related to the fact that the government is replacing the heating and cooling system in the White House's West Wing, so everyone who works there will need to leave by the end of the week\n\nCall me crazy, but immediately upon reading this part, my thoughts jumped to Russian spies bugging the White House. Almost an involuntary reaction, if you will, given the current circumstances revolving the President."
"Hey remember when conservatives were so MAD about how much vacation Obama took?\n\nIt's almost like they either didn't actually give a shit about the vacation at all, or the rules are different for a republican president."
'So...my job wont even approve a 2 week vacation, and this 1% jerk gets 17 days?'
'I remember back when i knew i was about to lose my job, i started to slack off too'
"Especially for those outside the US, it's worth noting that most workers here do not get 17 days of vacation in an entire year. Most full time employees get 10-15 days of vacation time to use across the entire year. So, sure, president is a big job, but that part adds extra insult. "
'"Look at all the golfing Obama\'s doing" \n\nLol...you pieces of shit know who you are. '
'Anyone interested in putting money in to hire a sky writer to write shit about him above his club?'
'Wait, tRump failed to followup on a pledge???'
'The same amount of fucks he gives about them.  They are not him, related to him, or praising him.  Therefor, they are worthless to him.'
"Let's add this to the...\n\nBullshit Hall of Fame for Trump.  It is now joined with:\n\n+Obama Wiretapped me\n\n+Obama is a Muslim\n\n+Obama is from Kenya\n\n+I'll donate money for charity for Obama's proof of birth\n\n+Ted Cruz's dad killed JFK\n\n+I lost the popular vote due to 3 million illegals voting\n\n+I had the biggest inauguration of all time. \n\n+I had the biggest electoral since Reagan \n\n+Climate Change is a hoax made by the Chinese\n\n+Obama founded ISIS\n\n+Mexico is going to pay for the wall\n\n+I have no business in Russia "
"Shocked.  I'm shocked I tell ya."
'And zero fucks given. \n\nEdit: by Trump'
'You mean accusations of using charities and campaigns as "slush" funds from Trump and the GOP were really just projection?!  Oh those wily rascals fooled me again.\n\nFucking tale as old as time.\n\n\n'
"It's funny how we blame the fool who makes the promise rather than the fools who believed him."
"This guy is a total piece of shit and I can't respect those who know everything about him and still support him."
'NO ONE pledges* more to charity than Donald. Everyone knows that! \n\n*not to be confused with "giving"'
'"Storm\'s a comin." Mara Lago is on ground zero. We, the taxpayers, may be rebuilding it, while we try to haggle with the Insurance companies who don\'t want to cover the flood damage to our own houses.'
"What happened to the 1 million out of his own personal money for the Hurricane Harvey aftermath?  He hasn't donated to his own Trump foundation since 2008 so if it's coming from there it isn't his money.\n\nOr does he get away with telling so many lies that people will let heim get away with this too?"
"Trump's a greedy fuck; I mean look at his bad taste ostentatious conspicuous consumption lifestyle.  Look at how many cases have been brought against him for reneging on his bills to contractors or fucking over tenants, or his fake university.  That anyone ever expected him giving a cent to charity is amazing. Trumps all about I me mine.   "
'ask his supporter and they say fake news... '
'Con men only take money, no matter what they say.'
"Even if he *had* donated all that money, it wouldn't redeem him for the lives he's ruined and crimes he's committed."
'Mildly shocking .... '
'Even zero fucks given.'
"Honestly, between the Trump administration and Season 7 of Game of Thrones, I don't think I'm capable of being shocked anymore."
"This piece of shit probably doesn't have any money to give. "
'If Trump was a democrat, the actions he takes would have Fox News screaming for impeachment daily. But instead the magic "R" after his name gives him license.'
'This is unfortunate. '
'Fuck you Trump you sack of wine!'
'Not too surprising, since nobody showed up'
'I\'m curious as to how this process plays out, but from what I\'m reading the Vice-President is very involved in the proceedings and considering Pence\'s declaration of "standing with the President" I\'m guessing he\'ll block this invocation.'
'About damn time!'
'"I don\'t like trump" so I will do anything and everything to undermine his presidency. \n\nIs anyone else bored with seeing this stuff on /r/all every day? '
'Just a bunch of partisan bullshit. When will democrats just accept that they lost?'

Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office'

"Trump is in such a state of fantasy, even if tapes came out certifying his comments, he would just say it wasn't him. Trump supporters would believe him. "
"The WH says there aren't any tapes in the article, and Durbin say he doesn't know of any.  Odd choice of headline."

'Well, Trump did say that he thinks future Oval Office meetings should be recorded to avoid the confusion in the future. \n\nLordy, let there be tapes! '
"Privileged information folks. Why would they release something that would prove the case when it's just easier to lie and cheat while your groupies takes every words for gospel.  (Guess I need an /s here...)\n\nHeck, even if the tapes were released, I doubt that the shock treatment would affect even one Trumpee."
'The Trump-supporter response to this story is incredible. They\'re simultaneously denying it and defending it by saying "how is he wrong?" Talk about hedging your bets.'

'> Quoting from a variety of works, such as Robert Bolt’s play A Man for All Seasons and The Federalist Papers, Will also found caustic words of his own for Republican leaders, notably Ryan.

'Trump isn’t some aberration; he’s result of 30 years of GOP lies, fear mongering, and playing footsie with white supremacy. Now that they’re facing down what they made, some hypocrites are trying to salvage their legacy in history. DON’T LET THEM. People like George Will are more responsible for the shithole Hellworld status of this country than Trump because Trump is too fucking stupid to have planned all this. All Trump does is react to whatever is in front of him.

"About 8 hours before this story broke, [another article about the rise in numbers of homeless vets appeared on Military Times.](https://www.militarytimes.com/veterans/2017/12/06/number-of-homeless-veterans-nationwide-rises-for-first-time-in-seven-years/) Here's a bit of it:\n\n> The impact of Trump administration policies on those numbers won’t be seen until late next year, when details of the January 2018 HUD point-in-time count are released.\n> \n> But in recent months, homeless advocates have expressed concerns with VA plans to convert funds dedicated to outreach and assistance efforts to general purpose money, with broader authority for regional directors over how to use it.\n\nThis unfortunate decision is going to piss off a lot of people."
'I can\'t seem to find the name of WHICH program is being cut. Yes, there are multiple.\n\nBased on context though, I\'m guessing it\'s HUD-VASH. This was a joint effort between Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide housing assistance for disabled and chronically homeless veterans.\n\nFor those unaware, chronic homeless is defined as a person who is living on the street, shelter, or other place not meant for human habitation for one contiguous year or more; or has had stayed in such locations a cumulative 12 months over the past 3 years; and also has a disabling condition that could prevent them from obtaining or maintaining a home.\n\nBasically, the program provides the eligible veteran with a voucher. Said voucher acts as a subsidy towards their rent. The veteran still has to find a home, but now they pay substantially less.\n\nThe great part about that is there\'s no need to build specialized housing or relocate people; they can find a home in their community. And, if they can\'t find one, the vouchers can be ported to another community and used there. \n\nThe downsides are that the veteran has to work with landlords and property managers who may have no interest in taking on a homeless client, even with the voucher making sure they receive all or most of the rent; a subset of the infamous NIMBY (not in my backyard) problem. \n\nIf HUD feels the veteran is not attempting to find housing, or the veteran chooses another form of housing (nursing home, permanent supportive housing, etc), they must relinquish the voucher back to the VA. \n\nI worked for a company that helped homeless vets, and worked closely with our local distributor of these vouchers. They do get a decent number returned...but many more used, and many more ported from other areas. \n\nOf course, another part of the problem is the constant redefinition of "chronic", "homeless", and "veteran". Slept on a relative\'s couch last night? Congratulations, you just lost homeless status. The VA doesn\'t recognize your severe mental/physical condition as disabling? You aren\'t chronic. Did you smoke a joint or badmouth your CO or DARE to get PTSD in Iraq? Your discharge status makes you not a veteran, regardless of whether you fought and bled for this country.\n\nOf course, that\'s the point. My area proclaimed we "effectively" ended vet\'s homelessness. What that means is that for the VA definition of vet (Honorable, General, Medical, and I believe now OTH discharges), they either found people at least a brief stay in a "permanent" housing situation (that includes couch surfing at Mom\'s!), or were unable to maintain contact with the person. \n\nThere are many just in my city more that need help and won\'t get it because the government plays games with their numbers.\n\nEDIT: [WaPo confirms it is HUD-VASH.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/12/06/va-tried-to-reallocate-460-million-earmarked-for-homeless-veterans-now-it-says-that-wont-happen/)  '

A Republican President has defiled the constitution, and a Republican Congress has allowed him to do so. If the report shows evidence of crime, and Republicans fail to hold him accountable, it will literally be the end of the rule of law, and the end of the republic. '

If he had an R beside his name would republicans pretend the spy allegations are "democrat witchhunts"? It doesn\'t make sense to me that someone could illegally and traitorously cheat their way to become president and be shielded from consequence. Not that anything is proven if Trump did in fact do that, but it\'s harder to believe he didn\'t based on his actions like this here. \n\nI don\'t know if Trump did collude with Russia, but even a Russian spy wouldn\'t be this obvious. It would be really funny if Mueller finds nothing connecting to Trump directly and Trump just pretended to be unable to say negative things about Putin to lure everyone with a brain into thinking there\'s kompromat, setting himself up to erode the public\'s trust into "MSM" later when Mueller doesn\'t find anything. \n\n\n '

And then there’s NBC.\n\nTrump’s “The Apprentice” had been removed from the network’s lineup amid low ratings. But a new programming chief came aboard in 2007, and the network decided to revive the competition show, but with a twist. And when the writers’ strike meant no more new episodes of “The Office” and “Scrubs,” NBC replaced the Thursday night shows in 2008 with “The Celebrity Apprentice.”"

Meanwhile Trump was trying to dodge VDs in New York City, and defrauding investors and banks who were dumb enough to lend him some cash.  His bone spurs were apparently also a valid excuse for not reporting for the draft.  \n\nMy dad is still working for the Navy at age 70, although the Republican incompetence is making it a challenge to get his job done.

"My god, Congress did something.  I know there are doom sayers in regards to Trump running amok with our allies this week, and I would not say their fears are unfounded.  However, to see anything hit this level of bipartisan support is basically unheard of in this day and age. While a resolution on its own is nothing much, the question is whether Trump sees the message that is underlying this vote.  Regardless of his base, a lot of powerful people and donors are already unhappy with the Trump tariffs, and as was seen with the tax scam, these are the true power brokers of Congress.  A break in the NATO alliance would invariably have an adverse affect on global markets, something big business cannot want.  So expect to see pressure back against Trump on any serious moves against NATO.\n\nWhile I don't see this happening right now, it is also fun to note that pulling out of NATO would be an impeachable event via the high crime of failure to adequately provide for the defense of the United States."

"i don't think Trump's servitude to Putin has anything to do with 'pee tapes' (not saying they don't exist) or anything of that nature. H could care less. He owes them a fuck-ton of money. i don't even think it's out there to say it could be 1+ billion. No matter how much i'm sure it's like owing the mob money on loan - or worse. He had nowhere else to get money from anymore & I don't see that he's made a significant amount of money that he could possibly be paying any of it back. I also believe mondy is the reason Trump loves Putin snd his ways so much - he is in total control/power, & has money hand over fist because of it. And the mobster aspect which I think Trump thinks secretly desires to be 'in the mob'. Idk just my theory. With all the accusations afloat - from possible abortion to the violent rape & beating of a 13yr old girl i think pee tapes and the like are kind of vanilla now.\n"

'Should the FBI really need direct orders to stop foreign meddling in our elections? He says that they are already taking measures to prevent it. Why would the president direct him to do something he is already doing?'
'So I am confused. We do want the President giving direct orders to the FBI Director? I thought we wanted a firewall between them. That Comey was uncomfortable with direct conversation with the President. '
"To everyone arguing that the FBI shouldn't have to be told to do its job, do you really not see a difference between a President who prioritizes fighting Russia's interference in U.S. elections via clear directives and one who doesn't? At best, Russia can be considered the United States' largest rival, at worst, its most powerful adversary. Why celebrate this passive attitude by the President?"

"> FBI director: Trump hasn't directed me to stop Russian meddling in midterms\n\nI think this one should be a no-brainer and Trump doesn't strike me as a micro manager, considering he's so non-detail oriented and disengaged on everything else he does."
'The fbi director  needs to be told to stop foreign influence in our elections?'
'Why would the FBI need to be directed by the President to stop a foreign government from meddling in an election? Shouldn’t this be a thing that is already covered?'
"I mean, shouldn't that be a given to try to stop other countries from meddling in our elections? Does the president really need to tell the director that?\n\nEDIT: Elections not ejections"
'He did call it fake news, so not surprised.'
'Why would he direct the FBI to stop something he wants to happen?'
"No president should be directing the head of the FBI to do anything. The FBI operates under the Judicial Branch. The Attorney General (Sessions) should be the one directing the FBI to do things. Of course it is expected that the president's requests would get to the FBI director via the AG, but at no point is it appropriate for any president to be directly ordering the FBI to do things."

I guess that's what happens when you're a deadbeat and you refuse to pay your attorneys."
"See, I don't care that he had an affair or is really trashy or whatever else. But the fact that he tried to hide it is significant. It opened him up to blackmail."
'This has got to be the dumbest personal lawyer in history: \n\nIn terms of facilitating the "hush money", Cohen sets up a company in Delaware, opens an account in the same name, and goes ahead and does(n\'t do) this:\n\n>"Mr. Cohen listed himself as the “authorized person” for the company, rather than hiring a lawyer or an agent to serve in that role, which some company owners do to further obscure their identities."\n\n'

"Yay, I helped! I'm Canadian and I called their investor relations line and left a message about how I'll never buy again if they don't leave the council. It's not much, but other than donating to the ACLU, my options from Canada are limited. "
'HAHAHA. Game theory bitch.\n\nNo one wanted to be the last person on the council. So everyone started jumping ship at the same time. Before everyone could jump off the ship, trump disbands the council. trump did a "you can\'t fire me, i quit" \n\nGOLD BABY, GOLD'
'Lol, now this idiot Trump is claiming he ended these executive panels while everybody is leaving. He\'s literally attempting the "You can\'t quit, you\'re fired!" defense. Holy fucking pathetic.'
'Trump has done a great thing for this country, he\'s united everyone against him.  I\'ve never seen everyone from all sides equally condemn him so much since he first came onto the political scene.  Fox News is shitting on him.  GOP senators and congressmen are saying "No Mr Trump, we stand against neo nazis, not anti-nazis".  \n\nIf there\'s one good thing to come out of all of this shit going on in Virginia, it\'s that the nation is finally starting to unite against the Trump administration.

'The GOP still has not asked for his resignation.  Complicit. '
"This isn't important because we think these ceos have high morals or anything. It's important because it shows our voice is influencing them and that means we have power to dismantle Trump's presidency. "

'Look Another example of people not reading literally 1 paragraph into the article:\n\n"U.S. officials say they used an algorithm to determine which goods to exclude from new tariffs. According to the Washington Post, the list was drafted to achieve “the lowest consumer impact,” ensuring goods like clothing and toys were excluded so as not to raise the cost on domestic consumer goods."\n\nGood job guys '
'God damn I despise this fucking family.  '
"That headline is misleading. They aren't imposing tariffs on the entire Chinese clothing manufacturing industry because it would be counterproductive. There is no reason to single out Ivanka over this because she isn't President. "
'Did no one actually read the article, just the title?'
'This is weak news'
'This headline could literally just say, "there will be no tariffs on clothing." It isn\'t a story.'
"LMFAO, people really aren't taking a think progress article seriously, are they?!?.  Nice astroturfing y'all."
'The entire clothing and toy industry is currently spared from the tariffs, not just her company specifically. The tariffs are only on steel and aluminum. Am I missing something?'
'As much as I disagree with every political opinion an orange gorilla could possibly have...\n\n...perhaps it was just a coincidence that Ivanka has a clothing line? Trump may have even forgotten his daughter owns a fashion business. '
"Nepotism is bad...but it's a stretch to claim Donald Trump is not imposing clothing tariffs so that he could help out his daughter's company. The steel tariffs alone will hurt his other family buisnesses, which just goes to show he has no clear idea on how impactful these tariffs will be. The amount of attention this article is getting is just sad."
'Is their any evidence that the clothing industry was exempt just for Ivanka?\nThe only major things included in the tarrifs were steel and some crops.\nI do not support Trump, but I also don\'t support baseless sensationalist articles.\nIt\'s also not just her brand thats "exempt from tarrifs" but the whole clothing industry.'
"so...sort by controversial becomes my new default for /r/politics today.. that's kind of sad.  the truth used to bubble to the top."
"I'm looking at the tariff right now, and textiles machines and parts are the only thing I say that remotely related to clothing. So this article is factually wrong. By in bulk the vast majority of products on this list are metals or alloys. Clothing was never a target for these tariffs there is no special treatment here.  https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/Press/Releases/301FRN.pdf  "

'If he just acted like it’s no big deal or disregarded it all together it wouldn’t have gotten this much attention. Now everyone’s going to buy it to see why he’s so worried. \nCongratulations, you played yourself. '
"Too bad trump's base doesn't know how to read."
"I generally don't read non-fiction political-natured books, but there's just too many reasons to get it. The two most important reasons being: the more this book sells, the more it pisses off Donald Trump and that I intend to leave it at my parents' house when I visit this week."

'In March of 1993, The United States Supreme Court issued a ruling in Flores vs Reno. (Yes, “That” Reno. Janet Reno, Bill Clinton’s first Attorney General who ordered that young Elian Gonzalez be torn from his parents arms while hiding in a Miami closet. You might remember the iconic photograph. https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2015/05/AlanDiaz.jpg&w=480)\n\nThe Court decided that minors could not be incarcerated with the adults accompanying them across the United States border illegally. The decision was the result of a long dispute in how to best care for these children while the adults were detained for criminal proceedings. \n\nYou see, when aliens cross the border illegally, they are incarcerated until their criminal case is decided. The understandable argument at the time was “why should children be incarcerated while their parents are in jail?” It seemed a fundamental violation of international human rights. Makes sense, right?\n\nAs a result, The Flores case drew a line in the sand. Children could not be incarcerated with their parents or accompanying adult while being held for illegal immigration violations. And a subsequent 1997 agreement stipulated that children must be placed in a safer environment where they could enjoy certain privileges, including education, a clean, safe environment and other normal life cycle amenities that incarcerated individuals do not enjoy.\n\nIt was considered a “victory” for human rights. By separating adult and child, we protected the children, reducing any harm done to them for their parent’s or accompanying adult’s decisions. \n\nA lot has happened since then. However; bottom line, these juvenile, shelters have been operating in accordance with the law, and overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services to protect those children from the hazards of parental incarceration since 1997.\n\nSo, since Donald Trump was running his real estate empire, selling wine and casinos in 1993, we are left to determine just how he managed to orchestrate this cruel “separation of immigrant parent and child” 25 years BEFORE he was President of the United States. The obvious answer is, he didn’t. He had nothing to do with establishing this United States immigration policy. Today, he simply enforces it. \n\nThis one story illustrates how important it is for us to do our research regarding today’s headlines. The Corporate Media either refuses to do the research, is incapable of doing the research or has done the research and decided to lie to you about its findings. Either way, this would make the Corporate Media lazy, incompetent or just plain deceptive. Liars, if you will.'

'This kills the NDA'
"It's always going to be an issue of semantics or details with Trump's claims. If he denies knowledge about the 130k payment, it likely means that he knew of the payment but didn't know the value of the payment. Or that he didn't know her name."
"Anyone that says they don't care about this but also believes Bill Clinton should have been impeached for having an affair makes you a hypocrite, that is all. "
"So now Avenatti can go back to teh judge and say Trump denies the payment, Cohen misrepresented the payment and made a payment without his client's knowledge, so he can blow the whole thing open.

She never heard the other side where she was living. When she knew better (after the war she was held at a camp), she was appalled.

'He does understand it’s a process still right? They would still have to weigh the evidence, etc. So basically he’s saying the only reason I haven’t been impeached is because I’m being protected by Republicans. Not because he’s innocent.

Several star athletes like LeBron James have criticized Trump for the move, with James saying that Trump was using sports to divide the nation.'
'Lmao the angry Butt hurt Trump fans down voting this.'
"Absolutely. This president has dragged the presidency down into the mud and shit. He's constitutionally incapable of acting with dignity and self respect. He's a mockery of everyone who's come before him. He's an ass."
'One common argument of Trump supporters is that LeBron, Steph, Kaep etc can\'t legitimately protest because they are rich and privileged.\n\nLeaving aside the fact that they are still subject to racism, it\'s very telling how they can\'t comprehend the idea that anyone would take a stand for an issue that doesn\'t affect them personally.\n\nLike even during the election season, they\'d say: "Why don\'t black people like Trump? He hasn\'t said anything bad about them, only Muslims and Mexicans."  \n\nAgain, leaving aside the flaws in that statement, they really couldn\'t understand the concept of empathizing with a group of people to which they don\'t personally belong.'
"Nothing is below Trump except the hateful slimy ooze he secretes and glides around on. \n\n(And Ivanka, on Father's Day.)"
'Obama said you should never punch down. \n  \nCurry should be ashamed. \n'
'Trump and his apologists are a disgrace to this country '
"The karma of the universe is wonderful. Every single day that trump wakes up is the worst day of his life. His kids are just waiting for him to die. Their public image has been trashed. His wife hates him and won't touch him. Everybody around him is under investigation, going broke because of legal fees, and is worse off for knowing him. He can't trust anyone around him. He is not welcome in the very city he spent his entire life. World leader's mock him. He has a job which he is unqualified for and has no clue how to do and is exposed publically. He can't actually pass legislation. He is most likely in debt to Russian mobsters. To top it all he has the world's greatest legal team assembled looking into every detail of his life. His tweets and rallies are all he has and even those bring him more disdain. He is miserable. The entire White House is miserable.\n\nContrast that with Lebron and Steph who by all accounts are at the top of their profession. Wealthy, young, talented, and good looking. They are respected by their communities and peers. The give back to others and have been extremely successful off the court. They have families that adore them and fans all over the world. They wake up every day and get to do what they love.\n\nSay no more Steph...you already won. "
'I\'m not sure why people still do not understand that Trump is and has always been a bigoted, racist, white supremacists that is unqualified, unprepared, uninterested, to be the presidency of this once great country. Trump and his administration are basically a Kleptocracy, "rule by thieves", is a government with corrupt leaders.'
'If anyone should be fired from their job for doing anything un-American it should be DJT.'
'Any president feeling the need to personally and publicly attack a sports figure is the sadest president ever.. '
"Nothing is beneath Trump, as we're still apparently learning.  The barrel literally has no bottom. "
'Trumps a lil bitch '
'No one is beneath Trump.'
"When we have a president who insists on living in the gutter morally, there is no one 'beneath' him."
'Absolutely loving the sports world popping off on Trump. They carry a fuckton of weight and can\'t get painted by the "MSM/lib shill" label the right tries to use all the time.\n\nSide note how fucking insane is it that LeBron James absolutely blasted the goddamn President and was fully justified in doing so? This is actually too fucking stupid to be fictional. '
"There is nothing beneath The Donald.  He'd fuck a snake if Vladimir would hold its head.  "
"Trump is incapable of being presidential.  He literally does not have the ability even if he wanted to, which he doesn't."
'dude has literal access to annihilate the planet in a few key strokes/passcodes.  But he decides to attack randos on twitter....this is not The Onion. '
"Imagine if Obama took to Twitter because he was angry the Tom Brady wasn't showing up. Imagine the reaction from conservatives. "
"Trump's home is in the gutter, that's where his morality is.  So, no, this isn't really beneath Trump, it's exactly where he lives."
'Very strange that Manafort and senior leadership seemed opposed to these proposed meetings. Potentially because this Papadapoulos guy was a low-level nobody? Another character added to the cast.'
'Wait the email Papadopoulos sent Lewandowski was dated the **27th of April**?

'I was missing some Russia news. Mueller keeps working quietly'
"My take: The Russians wanted to get in cahoots with the Trump campaign and knew that the adults on the campaign could hesitate, so they start with a gullible young guy who's eager to make his mark and would get excited by attention from up high. \n\nWhen that fails, they have to find someone who's not only gullible and wants to get attention from up high, but who could trump the adults. Enter Don Junior ..."
'Fuck him all the way up, WaPo. \n\nSo this is yet *another* person pushing a relationship with Russia. This nesting doll never ends, does it?'
'If Washington Post was a girl I would fuck her'
"If you don't want read this, check out Seth Abramson's Twitter feed. He broke it down in 100 tweets. "
"Russia was DESPERATE to collude! They got two agents onto Trump's FP team. They were trying every vector, and found Jr to be the weak point.\n\nManafort's initial resistance to a meeting shows he probably wasn't aiming to get Trump in with Putin, *at least initially*, but his persistent non-cooperation in the probe suggests there is more in his closet. For one thing, why didn't he do more to intervene in the June 9th meeting? "
"It's so strange that Trump and his people have all these ties to Russia....  Why don't we hear about any of them having ties to Ethiopia or some other place?\n\nThis might be the biggest coincidence in human history!\n\n/s"

'Fucking Boris Epshteyn, currently Chief Political Analyst at Sinclair Broadcast Group was in the Trump administration, is reportedly "Source E" in the Steele Dossier. \n\n> 1. Speaking in confidence to a compatriot in late July 2016, Source E, an ethnic Russian close associate of Republican US presidential candidate Donald TRUMP, admitted that there was a well-developed conspiracy of co-operation between them and the Russian leadership. This was managed on the TRUMP side by the Republican candidate\'s campaign manager, Paul MANAFORT, who was using foreign policy advisor, Carter PAGE, and others as intermediaries. The two sides had a mutual interest in defeating Democratic presidential candidate Hillary CLINTON, whom President PUTIN apparently both hated and feared.\n\n[Page 7 Of Dossier](http://annotateddossier.com/#page7)'
'I work at Sinclair as a master control operator and I don’t understand why this is news. EVERY SINGLE DAY we are forced to run right wing segments sent to us from Sinclair. I’ve personally had to edit and play paid programs featuring Sebastian Gorka going on monologues for half on hour on why Muslims can never integrate into US society. Every “crisis” and problem in the Trump administration has had a Sinclair segment defending it. '
"> Epshteyn then applauds Trump for stopping family separation with an executive order — “President Trump has correctly decided to step in and sign an executive order that will stop the separation of children from their families at the border” — without mentioning that it was Trump who implemented the policy in the first place. \n\nThis is one point that is driving me nuts. Trump and his supporters are praising him for signing the EO to end this horrible practice. The only reason this is in play is him. While the law has been around no one has ever enforced it to such an extreme level to violate human rights. That was this administration. That's like me imprisoning a bunch of people in my home, doubling down on it when I'm challenged then turn around and start praising myself for finding and releasing the people I imprisoned. "

'TL;DR: Here\'s a video that explains all of this is a much more cogent and stylish way than I could: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDL4c8fMODk\n\nJust so that people are aware: "the national debt" is not something that we have to pay back at all, and it is something that we almost never SHOULD pay back. "Debt", for a currency issuing entity, is merely a label for the supply of that currency. I know that it is confusing, and politicians are either confused themselves, or exploit and/or capitulate to that confusion, but it is true. You can go to anyone who works for a central bank and they will tell you exactly what I am telling you now.\n\nWhen a government that issues currency spends money it goes into "debt", but that "debt" is not like private debt that has to be paid back. The federal government, when it spends currency, spends it into existence. When the federal government taxes you, that currency is taxed back out of existence. The reason we have federal taxes is not to fund the government, it is to create a use value for currency. The use value of our currency is that it avoids the wrath of The U.S. Government that you would otherwise incur if you didn\'t pay taxes. When the government spends more than it taxes, it grows the supply of currency, a.k.a. it grows the national debt. This is a perfectly normal aspect of a growing economy. Every year our total supply of goods and services grows, why would our supply of currency not grow with it?\n\nThis is not me saying that just spending money into existence is always a good thing. Trump and his party are shit, and what they are spending that money into existence on is often complete shit. We should be spending money into existence on Medicare for All, not coal subsidies and bombs.\n\nThis is also not me saying that we can\'t possibly spend money into existence too quickly. We can, and we can get higher and higher inflation if we did. But as long as the money we are spending into existence is spent on valuable things, those valuable things have a deflationary effect on all prices. And taxes also have a deflationary effect on prices. These things need to be kept in a healthy balance, and debts and deficits are just one part of a much larger equation.\n\nPersonally, I actually think that we should have a slight deflationary pressure on our currency, in order to encourage saving and not consumption and growth, which is vital to prolonging our sustainability as a species, since all growth is unsustainable, and should therefore be approached with caution and not reckless abandon as we too often do and are encouraged to do. Inflation of prices encourages spending currency (and credit backed by currency), deflation encourages saving currency (and issuing less credit backed by currency). But, overall, a slight rate of either inflation or deflation are, from a financial standpoint, produce a very stable condition for the population that must use that currency.\n\nDisclaimer: This only applies to currency issuing nations. State governments should balance their budgets, and countries in The Eurozone should balance their budgets. But currency issuing nations like The United States, Canada, The U.K., Japan, China, Australia, and others, should never balance their budgets that are denominated in their own currency.\n\nAnother disclaimer: Countries actually can get into serious trouble if they go into debt in a foreign currency that they do not print. This is what happened in Weimar Germany. They went into debt in Francs, and, in order to pay off that debt, they printed fucktons of their own currency in a desperate attempt to control their population to sell their goods and services to France, in order to gain The Francs they needed to pay off their debt. Other countries are so powerless that they regularly use U.S. Dollars as a defacto currency instead of their own. These countries are also limited as currency issuers and currency users.\n\nThird Disclaimer: Currency is a tool used by a sovereign entity to make use of the capacity of the labor and other resources that it has control over. If the labor and other resources that that soverign entity has control over are shit, they will produce a shitty gamut of goods and services, possibly so little that they cannot properly feed their population. This is the situation that Venezuela is in right now. Their hyperinflation is merely a symptom of a much larger problem: They do not have the physical capacity to grow the food that they need to grow, or to produce the goods and services they need to produce to trade with other countries who have food. But one problem that they DON\'T have is the ability to go bankrupt in Venezuelan Dollars.\n\n'

'"Donald Jr. was a low level volunteer, and a liar."\n\nTrump, probably in a few hours.'
'This calls into question the legitimacy of any documents released by Wikileaks. Have they been an arm of Russian propaganda since the very beginning? Assange must be apprehended, as must Snowden and Manning. We need to find out how much they knew, and when they knew it.'

'I was thinking that Hewlett Packard story today was leaked. Now this. Putin is putin his foot on the gas. '
'Trump better start rage tweeting about the nfl and PR mayors to distract us. '

'Can you even imagine if Obama had this many shady dealings with Kenya? \nThe hysteria would be off the charts'
'No Puppet!'
"Another sincere question: If a person's lawyer does something illegal while working for the person in question is the person also culpable?\n\nDo we have to catch Trump in the act, or is the fact that multiple associates acted illegally in his name and with his (maybe unspoken) blessing?"

'But guys the Republican Party isn’t racist. '
'He will never find us mixed race people hiding behind German surnames. '
'Rampant economic anxiety! /s'

Therefore, Donald Drumphf is a liar for retweeting what someone said because it\'s a false fact."\n\nThe focus of the tweet is that Obama gave Executive Clemency to forgive many people that had controversial reasons for being in prison or having criminal charges.  [Of the acts of clemency, 1,715 were commutations \\(including 504 life sentences\\) and 212 were pardons.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_granted_executive_clemency_by_Barack_Obama)\n\nEveryone is calling Trump a racist nazi for pardoning a man that had a controversial history... but one point of the retweet is that all pardons and commutations are controversial by nature.

"I despise Trump and his administration, but other than your 'feelings' for him why does anything warrant him being blocked for stacking the courts? It is innocent until proven guilty not the other way around and it even sounds more and more like this Flynn allegation wasn't really some giant scandal rather than a (in transition) National Security Adviser getting ahead on his appointments and talking to 13 international diplomats and cooling Russia down about Obama's sanction because he was assuring them that Trump had a different view on their diplomatic relations. What Flynn did wasn't egregious but illegal and he did lie but I don't see how this means Trump should be legally blocked from stacking courts? Under what proven charge? If I am wrong an I missed something about some charge then let me know but from what I see it doesn't add up yet."

And being there he knew letter by Rosenstain didn't initiate firing. Here is [original story](https://lawnewz.com/high-profile/legal-experts-pence-may-now-be-implicated-in-obstruction-of-justice/). Hardly a hit piece.\n\n> Professor Shugerman’s logic appears to be that Pence’s statements are evidence that the vice president knowingly lied about the reasons for Comey’s dismissal and then attempted to conceal the truth from the public. Those lies, he argues, are enough for the two charges related to obstruction of justice.\n\nKeep in mind so far there are no obstruction of justice charges against anyone."

'POTUS is a Pathological serial liar.\n\nIn no way is this normal.\n\nOr honorable.'
'Mr. Trump, what you’ve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.'
'What was pointed out to me recently is the difference between lying and bullshitting. \n\nLying requires the liar to be aware of the truth, attempt to nuance their lie in an attempt to fit it in with the truth and have it go unnoticed.\n\nBullshitting is a complete disregard for facts and no attempt to sneak it in with reality. You dont need to be aware of the truth but you probably are and yet other factors (ego, etc.) are more important.'

'No. No, he doesn’t. Facts are facts regardless of your feelings or biases. You literally cannot make them up.\n\nWe already have a word for that. It’s called "lying."'
'There are only a handful a people in the world egotistical enough to say that they “make up facts”. Trump might be the only one who actually believes his own made up facts. '

Singular: the corruption of the American government by the president and his associates, who are using their official power for personal and financial gain rather than for the welfare of the American people, and their attempts to shield that corruption from political consequences, public scrutiny, or legal accountability.\n\nThis shit is too accurate. While MAGA voters are mocking you, saying "first it\'s Russia, now it\'s China, now it\'s Saudis" just remember: why not all three?\n\nStill no income tax returns, still nothing divested, still no accountability!

'From the AP article:\n\n>Broidy boasted that he had got the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, **California Republican** Rep. Ed Royce, to back an anti-Qatar bill.\n\n>“This is extremely positive,” Broidy wrote.

'Trump is hardwired to commit crimes and destroy evidence of them.  He’s been doing it for so long, that it is a habit he can’t break.'
"People are missing the point here (and also going on irrelevant fevered tangents).\n\nYou get subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury to speak about things you have witnessed or otherwise have knowledge of. If you lie, you can be charged with a crime, but this isn't meant to be a 'gotcha'. Bannon isn't the target at this time. Mueller is going after someone(s) else. It's also considered bad form to use the grand jury to go after a lower level person. \n\nSo either the target is a Bannon boss/same level inside the White House. That leaves Flynn, Preibus, Pence, Trump, and Trump family. We know Flynn is cooperating. Preibus has been interviewed but otherwise quiet. Pence has kept this nose clean so far. So that leaves Trump and family as targets.\n\nThere are also Bannon bosses outside the White House. The Mercers are tied to shady shit, including tax evasion. Given how they funded the campaign and brought in Cambridge Analytica, and how many foreign powers have connections to CA, potentially the Mercers/CA could be targets as well.\n\nNow here's the biggest point. Was the subpoena hostile in nature? Did Bannon refuse to testify willingly because he wants back in favor with Trump and Mercer? Or is this political theatre on Bannon's part? He may trying to signal to Trump and Mercer that he's willing to be a good team player again. Regardless, he's not stupid enough to lie in the grand jury so the practicalities are the same.\n\nEdit: I thought about another thing when I was getting a cup of coffee. Manafort and Gates have been playing hard-ball, even after their arrests and indictments. Bannon stepped in to Manafort's position and was surrounded by the same people and strategy Manafort instilled into the campaign. Potentially Mueller wants more information about how the campaign was operating and communicating with at that time to really puts the screws to Manafort's and Gate's."

"I can't wait to see the whole family go to jail for treason; mostly because I want to see the permanent mouth-gapes on every republican that obsessed over buttery males.

'Awful. There has never been an American president in history who has attempted to shift US policy towards Russia in the way Trump has. When Obama took office, he recognised the grave danger that Russia posed to the free world and avoided doing anything which would have emboldened its leaders to act hawkishly. Trump is throwing this precedent down the river to try and “reset” relations with Russia in a manner which is simply impossible. People are definitely right to be outraged although it would be nicer if it were more than half of them.'

'1.\tHalf of Americans have no idea this event even took place and \n2.\tjust barely half of all people vote\n\n\nSo, as we can see, this poll is bullshit. If half of Americans truly thought this event was treasonous, surely they would do one of the very few things that allow them to affect the person who committed this “treasonous “. That would be vote. So either an IMMENSE amount of people have suddenly come in to the likely voter category AND learned very quickly the subtleties of Presidential politics and constitutional law OR THIS POLL IS BULLSHIT.\n\nI cannot wait for November. Democrats truly haven’t grasped how quickly and severely the game has changed. Trump isn’t the tipping point in this country, that happened 10 years ago when the Democrats really jumped the shark.\n\nI can’t believe it’s been so long and they’re still trying to figure this all out.'
'"Acted treasonous" isn\'t strong enough language. He committed actual treason on live TV. Don\'t give them inches on this.'
"I am writing to admonish that charges should be brought against The White House.\n\nThis administration has shown a clear dereliction of duties in several areas.\n\nIt has failed to enforce sanctions that were passed by a bi-partisan Congress.\n\nIt has sought, repeatedly, to operate against American interests in trying to shut down early the investigation by the Special Counsel; an investigation that needs to conclude to ensure that our democracy is not being tampered with.\n\nIt has failed to instruct and guide our security agencies to take appropriate actions to harden our defenses in our national discourse and in our electoral process; despite being informed that there was interference in the previous election.\n\nIt has operated AGAINST American interests in starting trade wars that hurt the American economy and sought to weaken alliances that are in the interest of American economic power. It has degraded the American stance before one of the most important military alliances in history, in NATO, and is slowly eroding American influence in the world.\n\nIt's behavior in the Helsinki summit shows that it does not have American interests at heart; rather instead choosing to capitulate before a foreign adversary.\n\nThis White House has argued that it is installing American first policies, but instead has installed America only policies which benefit only our foreign opponents by alienating us from the world stage; one that America must maintain to be relevant in this new century.\n\nMoreover, it has acted in un-American ways, by promoting policies that seek to divide peoples rather than unite them - by installing travel bans that seek to alienate people of different creeds and religions; rather than accurately defending them in any manner that shows a true security concern. Three times has this Administration sought to install this travel ban policy.\n\nIt has sought to derail the soul of America, by installing hurtful immigration policies, by separating families that are seeking to enter our country from strife and violence.\n\nThe executive office has NOT been faithful in executing its duties for the American people, and this must NOT be allowed to continue."
'Only half? You guys are in trouble'

"I'm not sure if Trump knows that Hawaiians are US citizens "
"Why are we giving her recognition? Hillary is the very specific reason that Trump won the presidency. I know several people that voted for Trump ONLY because Hillary was the opposing candidate. This sub should know this, but yet we give her voice. Why?!? She's been quoted and on the front page too much recently, and it's that kind of exposure that may give her the stupid idea that the people want her to run again."
"Wow, this place has really gotten to kissing up to Clinton lately. How quickly people forget.\n\nIn this case, the criticism seems unfounded to me. He clearly knows they're citizens judging by the aid he's given so far and his recent tweets.

'Couple things...\n\n* Trump definitely stayed overnight in Moscow.  His own bodyguard testified as much lmao. \n\n* Why did he lie about it then?  Well... he lies about everything, big and small.  So who really knows. \n\n* We have to keep in mind that the dossier said a few interesting things... That there were many occasions where Trump had hookers over in his hotel in Moscow AND St. Petersburg and that the Russians had tapes of a lot of them.  Which is fuckin crazy...\n\n* Lastly, there was recently some doubt on the pee pee tape portion of the dossier (Steele himself said that bit is likely 50-50).  It\'s possible the rumors and intel were getting 2 things confused... Trump staying with hookers in moscow, and Trump being at this club in vegas where the "strip" show or whatever was a faux pee pee party thing.  \n\nGuess we\'ll see.  But it\'s crazy that I shift every few weeks from thinking the pee tape part of the dossier is probably fake and/or disinformation to... "Holy shit it might be real..."\n\n\n'

"Reading the comments it appears people do not understand the problem. Republicans are not repentant, do not acknowledge the act happened, and therefore nothing was done wrong since there was nothing proven in a court of law.\n\nDemocrats, liberals, celebrities, etc are being tried in public opinion and are admitting guilt. They are starting to repent. Therefore they are guilty of the act.\n\n\nI am not giving credence to their insane justification, but what appears to be hypocrisy is not.\n\nIt appears to be a common problem for the conservatives, especially the religious. They cannot come forward and repent, which is the proper Christian thing to do. Instead they deny, attack the victim, bribe, conspire to hide, etc  until they are caught, then they appear to repent and the cycle repeats itself. For some reason this is acceptable to a large portion of the public.\n\nMeanwhile you have people like Franken who are in a position to make changes for the better who are repentant who have made mistakes and owned up to them and have grown. They hopefully have learned from their experience and stopped their behavior, yet from a few incidents, their heads are being called for.\n\nIf you step back and look at this as reinforced behavior, guess which example the public is showing people to choose? Yep, hide, obfuscate, deny, and lie. The reason that this is done is that it works. Until societal behavior changes and can tolerate that, oh my God, politicians are human and make mistakes, thus behavior will continue. What we should be doing is reinforcing the behavior we want.\n\nIf you think you can have hundreds of politicians that have never done anything wrong, never acted inappropriate in a time in their life, then don't vote. This is why there are age limits. People make mistakes and learn from them. They grow from their experiences.\n\n The ones that can look back and be shown what they did was wrong, then learn from that are the type we need leading our society in politics, entertainment, and business. The type that refuse to learn, that hide what was done, that cannot learn are the ones that must be castigated.  Currently we have it backwards"

'Look, I don’t know if you just googled “Trump is moderate” and posted whatever came up, but those sources are seriously shit. One was a twitter post that just said Trump was “viewed” as moderate. The other couldn’t stop itself from smearing Barack:\n\n > Barack Obama, following the economic crisis of 2008, sought to implant “lead from behind” foreign policy and an update of the Great Society, and to “fundamentally transform” the country, usually by focusing on identity politics as the core of the culture (in which the color of our skin rather than the content of our character would brand us for who we are).\n\nWhat a sick joke. If I googled Trump is Hitler and threw a bunch of Tabloids at you, that wouldn’t convince anybody.\n\nThe simple fact is that you base your opinion not on pre-election articles but Trump’s actions. So I’m still not convinced he is moderate and if you’re really interested in convincing me you’re going to have to actually explain your own position. '

'I have a feeling these “leaks” are coordinated with Mueller.

"I don't know if he realizes that a pardon won't save him from impeachment. That's entirely a political process, not a legal one. A pardon would just keep him from being prosecuted after he leaves office. "
'Republicans during the election "Lock her up!" Republicans during Trump " He can pardon!" \n\nIf you need anymore evidence that these people are window licking morons, you might be the problem.'
'He will not attempt to pardon himself until his last day in office. It will be the last thing he does while President. If he is impeached, it will occur just before a Senate vote to convict; if he makes it to the end of his term, it will be in the last hours of his presidency. It will also be a blanket pardon for any and all federal crimes he may have committed. It will then go to the SCOTUS to determine if a president actually has the power of self\\-pardon.'
'See, the GOP will say that the Democrats don\'t have a message, and that\'s why they attack Trump.\n\nI\'ll agree that the Democrats have sucked at proactive messaging for the past, oh...20 years or so.\n\nBut one thing that\'s pretty damn clear: it is *not* cool to have a president who has no regard for the rule of law. That\'s not personality. It\'s not politics. It is an objective truth that this goon is not fit for office and hurts the country every day he maintains his power.\n\nIs "no criminals or corrupt man\\-children in power" an inspiring message? Maybe not. But at the moment, it\'s what the Dems have, and it\'s pretty damn important.'
'He can simply shoot all the Democrats in Congress in the head, then he can never be impeached.\n\nThe founders obviously never intended for the President to be able to parson himself.\n\nThat power would make the US a dictatorship.'
"He's too fucking stupid to understand this though"
'He needs to be convicted of a federal crime before he can pardon himself. '
'No shit.'
"Whoa, back this bullshit train up! He doesn't have the power to pardon himself. It's a well trodden point of discussion among experts. Why are we fucking conceding this ground??? Jesus tap-dancing Christ. Hold the line!!!"
"He can't pardon himself from impeachment. The Constitution is unambiguous on that point."
"Impeachment is a vote of no confidence from Congress against the president, it doesn't really actually have anything to do with criminal charges.\n\nAlleged crimes or wrong doing are the only requirements and they were left purposely subjective.\n\nIt doesn't say you have to impeach based on those crimes though, so it's really about Congress losing confidence in the President.\n\nThe crime or wrong doing clause is honestly just a lame stop gap they came up with because they knew Congress would abuse it otherwise. The intention was always for Congress to have sweeping power to remove the president if they lost confidence in him or if he was in Gross dereliction of his duties.\n\nI think they may have errored on the side of making impeachment too easy to start but the actual meat and potatoes of conviction too difficult.\n\nIt makes impeachment mostly useless and still kind of easy to abuse since you actually need zero evidence. The Supreme Court is not going to step in and tell the House that it's grounds for imprachment is too weak, for instance. They also aren't going to override a Senate aquital. \n\nIn  a polarized political system US impeachment is a joke or a PR stunt. Congress is often it a position where one party can wield impreachment and House investagory power, but neither can get a conviction.\n\nIt's more likely to be abused than used when needed because of the simple-minded us vs them strategy and the way human behavior trends. One party tends to do well for awhile, but neither makes the public significantly happier overall and the public will blame the parties long before they blame themselves."
'Don’t you have to be first charged with a crime to be granted a pardon? '
"If trump pardons himself, we're officially dead as a Constitutional Republic.  We will be a dictatorship or a monarchy."

"Does Trump really believe the problem will go away if he just fires people? .  I'm assuming this is how he ran his businesses. What a doofus"
"I just realized something. I mean I knew it, but the import of it escaped me until now. This moron thinks *firing people in the civil service is the same as firing someone at a corporation.*\n\nIt's just fundamentally different. If a CEO is ousted, the next CEO *is expected* to change everything and demonstrate how they're the one to shake things up.\n\nGovernment posts are designed to function regardless of the party in power or political affiliations of the directors. There is built in inertia, so that a department can continue to function *even as the CEO changes*.\n\nOf course, McCabe kept notes. Of course, the FBI resents being politicized. So, many people working together regardless of party affiliation can't afford a gap in the fucking FBI just because the director gets canned.\n\nI sincerely think each time a firing happens Trump expects huge waves and upgeaval, and is baffled that diligent people just keep working at the same goals.\n\nSo, yeah, McCabe kept memos. Probably not even out of personal fear. He probably keeps them out of concern that someone else will have to carry out his duties if he gets the flu.\n\n\n\n"

The title was "Breaking: McCabe altered FBI documents to frame Flynn."\n\nI apologise if it\'s been posted here numerous times, but given how prevalent Alex Jones has become these last year or so, I worry that there\'s a probability that this will become a passed-along talking point, pushed along social media by bots and believers alike. I looked it up, and most are sites I have never heard of along with shit like thegatewaypundit, and one of the quotes jumped out at me was "investigative journalist said on Hannity last night" and "if things she heard is correct." In other words, it sounds like hearsay from Hannity\'s show passed along from unknown site to unknown site as "breaking news" in order to push the narrative.'

">President Donald Trump's 2020 reelection campaign has spent about $835,000 in legal fees so far this year, or about 22 percent of its total spending, according to the latest fundraising reports filed quarterly with the Federal Election Commission.    \n\nThe amount is for this year and it's only April.

It was at that meeting that Papadopoulos first informed Trump and the then candidate’s other foreign policy advisers that he had contacts in Britain who could arrange a summit between the GOP candidate and Putin.\n> \n> Although one of the campaign officials present, J.D. Gordon, has said the idea was shot down by then Alabama Sen.

'"A mixture of gullibility and cynicism had been an outstanding characteristic of mob mentality before it became an everyday phenomenon of masses. In an ever-changing, incomprehensible, world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that everything is possible and that nothing was true. The mixture in itself was remarkable enough, because it spelled the end of the illusion that gullibility was a weakness of unsuspecting primitive souls and cynism the vice of superior and refined minds. Mass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst, no matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow. The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness."

Rosenstein, who is currently overseeing the investigation, couldn’t do or has not done? The answer is clear. Trump is angry that Sessions recused himself *because he expects his attorney general to quash any investigation into his own misconduct and that of his campaign*. There is simply no legitimate reason for him to be displeased with Sessions’s recusal.  \n>  \n>Imagine what a normal president would say in this situation.

"Again we see that a major motivator for the Russians is the Magnitsky act.\n\n>The memo that Ms. Veselnitskaya brought to the Trump Tower meeting alleged that Ziff Brothers Investments, an American firm, had illegally purchased shares in a Russian company and evaded tens of millions of dollars of Russian taxes. The company was the financial vehicle of three billionaire brothers, two of them major donors to Democratic candidates including Mrs. Clinton. By implication, Ms. Veselnitskaya, said, those political contributions were tainted by “stolen” money.\n\n>Kremlin officials viewed the charges as extremely significant. The Ziff brothers had invested in funds managed by William F. Browder, an American-born financier and fierce Kremlin foe. Mr. Browder was the driving force behind a 2012 law passed by Congress imposing sanctions on Russian officials for human rights abuses.\n\nThe charges of tax-evasion are ginned-up.  Russian police raided Browder's Moscow office, stole his company's papers, and used them to illegally transfer ownership to a recently released murder.  They then used the new 'owner' to file an amended tax return and apply for a tax refund worth hundreds of millions of dollar.  They applied on Dec 23rd.  The refund, the largest in Russian history, was approved *the next day*.\n\nBrowder has championed Magnitsky in many forums.  He's told the story many times, most recently on Preet Bharara's excellent [podcast](http://www.wnyc.org/story/death-sergei-magnitsky-bill-browder/).\n\nIf you haven't heard it, it's an excellent summary, and puts the entire mess in perspective.

"Yeah, Little Donald kept saying it was the democrats' fault and of course Fox news echoed it endlessly. Even though the republicans had control over the house of reps, the senate and the administration when these concentration camps first started running as aggressively as they are now. To be fair I.C.E. was first formed under Obama, but under Obama I.C.E. was only going after immigrants that committed crimes. Trump and republicans are the ones that started going after ALL illegal immigrants even those of which that aren't hurting anything by being here. (Edit 1): Correction I.C.E. was formed under Bush Jr, but Obama and Trump both made it even more aggressive."
"Trump a liar?  Next you'll tell me water is wet."
'This was such a blatant attempt to use separated families as a bargaining chip to get other concessions on immigration, notably his stupid fucking wall. He went from "I didn\'t do this and I can\'t stop it" to "Well I guess Congress will have to send me a bill" (which by the way, none of the Republican bills were simply to end separations, they all had other stuff thrown in), and now all of a sudden he\'s found the power to end separations after intense backlash.'

'He can sign an EO, but the buck stops with AG Sessions and the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security - they are entirely free to ignore the order, legally, thanks to the 1993 Flores Decree in combination with the Immigration Reform Act of 1996 and the Homeland Security Act of 2002. In combination these three things moved quite a bit of power over immigration from the POTUS and Congress directly into those two offices and whomever holds them. To whit - it is the sole purview of the AG on where people are detained, the Secretary decides where and how they get arrested, and both offices have the power to add criminal charges on top of any civil penalties.'

As an American, I\'m already embarrassed. If decent Arizona residents don\'t make a significant show of protest... I may have to move. /s \n\nThat said, my fingers are also crossed that any and all protests are carried out PEACEFULLY and without incident. I would also beg that protesters respect law enforcement who are out in the AZ heat doing their jobs tonight. \n\nBut regardless, the worst part is that I can already hear Trump giving a rhetoric-filled speech about fear, terrorists, rapists, murderers, and drugs -- with specific emphasis on "Mexicans" and "The Wall". And in return, he\'s get a ton of cheers and chants of "PARDON ARPAIO!" from his racist base, and it\'s going to make him feel more comfortable issuing that pardon.... I\'d say by Friday. It should be the perfect tidbit to start off the (now routine) weekend news frenzy since Trump\'s inauguration.'

No. They should call *vocational schools* "vocational schools", and they should call community colleges *"community colleges"*.\n\nI\'m all for higher promotion of vocational programs in America though. In my personal upbringing, vocational programs were viewed as "lesser" and something that the dumb kids go into. But these days, "dumb" kids (Rather, kids with low test scores and mediocre grades) can totally get a 4 year degree in all sorts of majors with no serious problems. And "smart" kids can get into vocational jobs with no college and find very lucrative and satisfying careers. I don\'t think Trump has considered the issue anywhere near to that extent.

It is difficult to describe the Koch network using traditional terminology from political science like interest-groups or lobbyists. It most closely resembles organized crime syndicates at the top and Al-Queda's network/cell structure at the bottom. Adjectives that describe the Koch's: secretive, ruthless, self-interested, unscrupulous, opportunistic. Their networks overlap with and shade into the rest of the political right (CPAC, NRA). In Mayer's book, the Koch network appears as a secret command structure that controls Republican leadership at local, state, and national levels. Trump was not their man, but his win provided an opportunity for Koch minions to infiltrate the Trump administration and to push forward their destructive, slash-and-burn agenda with the full cooperation of the House and Senate (that they already controlled). Mayers describes the Koch's as deeply anti-democratic, authoritarian, and destructive. "

Roger Stone basically admited to be in cahoots with a Russian agent.'
"he's gonna start bragging about colluding soon. mark my words. "

State and President, but they had a lot less incentive to coordinate an attack on their own party.\n\nThis is starting to tie together a little more clearly.'

'A certain group is, of course, calling this fake news, and pointing to articles in which an "expert" said that it was impossible that the DNC emails were hacked from outside because of the required speed (23MB/s) to download them all in the window during which the hack took place (87 seconds, if I remember correctly). They point to evidence by some entity calling itself "Forensicator," who said "those speeds were completely impossible. See? Here are my speed test results and I can\'t download that fast. Also 23MB/s is exactly the speed of a USB 2.0 flash drive." The first part is irrelevant and the second is BS.\n\nThis is despite the fact that literally any individual current capable of reading such articles can prove that it was easily possible for someone to download at those speeds in DC in 2016. Even to or from Russia. Verizon offered speeds up to 500Mbps (about 62.5MB/s) in DC in 2016.\n\nBusinesses and government facilities have more options for bandwidth than the average homeowner (though if you\'re willing to pay the *massive* price differences you can probably get a business connection at home), so these download speeds are so easily within the realm of possibility that the claim that this hack MUST have been an insider downloading to a USB drive are laughable.\n\nSo laughable are these claims that anyone making them despite being shown evidence to the contrary **has to know** that they\'re lying to themselves and everyone around them. The few debates I\'ve seen on the issue devolve to one guy saying "here, look at this internet archive page from 2016 showing bandwidth offerings, and check out these actual speed tests between DC and eastern Europe," and another guy saying, "why won\'t you just come clean and admit you\'re a democrat?"\n\nThis blows my mind. When you have the option to independently verify something and *refuse to do so*, you should just lose your "spreading an opinion on the internet" privileges.'

'So what are the chances of Nunes facing any repercussions for creating a dangerously false narrative by deliberately misleading through omission of fact? '
'Media need to immediately stop referring to the dossier as *unverified* \n\nAs the Schiff memo attests, the FBI were able to corroborate several aspects of the Steele Dossier through multiple independent sources.'
'https://twitter.com/SethAbramson\n\nFollow Seth Abramson\'s twitter thread on this. He\'s breaking it down point by point and connecting the dots. Something he pointed out that I find particularly interesting is memo point number 6. \n\n>26/ MEMO POINT #6: The reason Steele\'s *highly relevant* Trump-Russia intel took *weeks and weeks* to get to the FBI team investigating Trump-Russia ties is that the FBI was *so protective of Trump and the election process* it didn\'t want anyone to know it was investigating him.\n\n>27/ This is stunning. Why? Because in July 2016, the FBI breached protocol to hold a press conference about its investigation of Clinton, rather than just—per protocol—issuing a one-sentence statement saying the matter was closed and/or that it had no active investigation of her.\n\n>28/ *At the very same time*, the FBI was *so closely guarding* the secret that it was investigating Trump—mind you, for actions *far* more serious than anything alleged about Clinton—that it had no mechanism to get new, relevant evidence to its *super-secret* Trump-Russia team.\n\n>29/ In sum, the FBI\'s differing treatment of the Clinton and Trump probes—protocol-breaching public disclosures and illegal leaks for her, super-secret protection from even *relevant new evidence* for him—looks for all the world like *the* key factor in the 2016 election results.\n\n>30/ What\'s worse, when media finally came to the FBI pre-election to ask, "Do you have anything on Trump?", the FBI lied and said "no." Meanwhile, Giuliani\'s NYPD pals went to the FBI with old, already-adjudicated Clinton emails and the FBI told *everyone* her case was re-opened.\n\n>31/ So we\'re only on pg. 3 of the Democratic Memo—and only the first few sentences of pg. 3—and already it\'s clear that the FBI scandal here is not how the FISA warrant on an ex-Trump advisor was applied for, but how the FBI handled the *entirety* of the Clinton and Trump probes.\n\nHe\'s essentially alleging that the FBI\'s blatant mishandling of the Clinton witchhunts, while actively shielding itself from new info on the Trump campaign is even more to blame for Clinton loosing the election than we thought. The reason Steele went to Yahoo news in the first place is because the FBI sat on the info he gave them in July 16. By August 16, **nothing** had been done with his data. This is further compounded by the reopening of the Clinton investigation days before the election, while simultaneously saying there were no Trump ties to Russia ten days before the election, even though, they had been investigating the Trump team for months. There were people in the FBI who had this information, and sat on it til it was too late, even as Clinton intel was being improperly disclosed. This is what caused Steele to go to Yahoo news and that is what caused him to be terminated as a source by the FBI. Now there\'s an investigation into the FBI because of that kind of behavior. \n\n>60/ Keep in mind that IG Horowitz is right now investigating the very rogue-agent shenanigans at the FBI that caused Steele to feel that his critical national-security intelligence was not reaching those it needed to reach—even as Clinton intel was being improperly disclosed.'
'It\'s silly to call this a "rebuttal." This memo is a fact. What the GOP released is sleaze and full of untruths and innuendo.\n\nSadly, they knew what they were doing. Their followers will believe what was in that, and dismiss this as "fake news." '
'Compiling all the tidbits that I and other people find:\n\n---\n\n> The FBI had an independent basis for investigating [Carter] Page\'s motivations and actions during the campaign, transition, and following the inauguration. As DOJ described in detail to the Court, Page had an extensive record as ██████████████████████████████████ prior to joining the Trump campaign. He resided in Moscow from 2004-2007 and pursues business deals with Russia\'s state-owned energy company Gazprom--███████████████████████████████████████████████████. As early as ███, a Russian intelligence officer █████████████████ targeted Page for recruitement. Page showed ███████████████████████████████████████████████████.\n\nThe whole Carter Page section looks like it would be a bombshell in its own right if not for all the damn redactions.\n\n> FBI and DOJ officials did not "abuse" the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) process, omit material information, or subvert this vital tool to spy on the Trump campaign.\n\n...\n\n> In subsequent FISA renewals, DOJ provided additional information obtained through multiple independent sources that corroborated Steele\'s reporting\n\n...\n\n> Far from "omitting" material facts about Steele, as the Majority claims, DOJ repeatedly informed the Court about Steele\'s background, credibility, and potential bias\n\n...\n\n> DOJ never paid Steele for the "dossier." .... Steele ultimately never received payment from the FBI for any "dossier"-related information\n\n...\n\n> In fact DOJ referenced Isikoff\'s article, alongside another article the Majority fails to mention, not to provide separate corroboration for Steele\'s reporting, but instead to inform the Court of Page\'s public denial of his suspected meetings in Moscow\n\ntl;dr, Nunes is a dirty liar.'

Each renewal requires *new evidence* found during the given warrant period, and each has to pass muster with a judge. I had to hedge my claims and say there were "up to four judges involved," but now it feels real fucking vindicate-y to see that it was four different judges.

'This ruling fails to understand how Twitter works. As long as an account isn\'t private, no one is prevented from seeing a tweet by being blocked. All they would have to do is log out to view it. You can also still send tweets at them, they just won\'t be notified. In no way does it stop either party from seeing each other\'s tweets.\n\n\nIn essence this ruling says, "public officials cannot make it slightly more difficult for people to interact with them." \n\n\nIf this case were based around a public official making their official account private I would understand the ruling, but right now this seems like a petty ruling based on political agenda rather than constitutionality.'
'1. Twitter and individuals on twitter can have their behavior dictated by judicial rulings based on the "right" to see the posts on someone\'s account. Twitter is now a partially nationalized company. \n2. Twitter is a private company and can ban right wingers and other dissenters as they please. \n\nPick one. \n\nTwitter has a monopoly over its type of social outlet, and as a result practically solely controls that part of the virtual public space. "Trump is a public official and you are nobody" is not an argument that\'s going to cut it. Of the outlets of its kind, there is twitter, and there are containment zones. Being relegated to the latter is a violation of the 1st and 14th amendment. The founding fathers turned in their graves long ago, now they\'re trying to break out of their coffins. \n \nBtw going to include this court case for anyone itching to reply with some neoliberal drivel about the rights of private companies: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh_v._Alabama'

'Dirty Clinton Judge unduly imposing rules on President Trump.\n\nThe first admendment guarantees the right of free speech, not that the people have to be listened to.\n\nThe President already listens carefully to the NRA, Putin, the Koch brothers, and investors in Trump and Kushner businesses. Requiring the President to listen to the American people is an unneeded distraction from communication with the groups that he works on behalf of. /s'
"Realistically, this will go up to the supreme court, edit: unless someone else smashes it down first, and they'll make a final call.\n\nMy prediction:  Anyone can block anyone on twitter.\n\nWhy?  In real life we're not guaranteed message delivery to the president either.  The concept is freedom of speech, not a guarantee to be recieved.  Blocking people does not silence them, it is merely an efficient means of not dealing with them in that one arena.\n\nAnyone can still speak their mind on their own twitter account or on various other twitter feeds, plus thousands of other websites. \n\nNote: This works both ways.  Dem's can block whoever they find to be annoying as well, as many do.  Got some nazi stalker troll?  Block them. Because while they have freedom of speech, they don't have guaranteed access to your eyes.  Freedom of speech is not a guarantee to be heard and respected.\n\nNote:  There is no such thing as a public forum where people cannot be barred.  We always will have rights to eject uncivil and dangerous people.\n\nNo rights are being oppressed just because you are blocked on one single platform by an individual."

"I'm so sick of this administration and the Republicans refusing to even address this issue. Instead we get pre-fabricated condolences and chalk it all up to mental health issues.\n\n Either America has a disproportionate case of the crazies or theres an underlying issue. Much like heart disease or diabetes, every country on the planet has mental health issues, but they aren't having monthly mass shootings. Look I can side with the argument that more background checks and limiting firearm sales probably wouldn't stop the problem. Most of these shooters are using someone else's gun. I believe the solution lies with accountability. My guns are all in a safe that ONLY I know the combination to, all have a trigger lock, with keys that ONLY I have. If my wife or child or a friend wants to use one, that's fine, but I'll be with them and ensure they use it responsibly. If all gun owners all had this mentality, I guarantee there would be a significant drop in these shootings. First step is openly talking about the issue and then potentially implementing harsh criminal penalties to anyone whose firearm is used in any form of illegal activity. Most importanly allocate some money towards educating  consumers on safely guarding their guns from even friends and family. Unfortunately Republicans don't even want to talk about it for fear of backlash from their constituents and donors, so instead we get thoughts and prayers and the clock is reset anxiously awaiting the next incident.\n\nIf people guarded their firearms as well as they  guard their atm pins, alot of this problem would correct itself."
"But watch, by March, all of the GOP will move on having given out the maximum amount of prayers, while this shooting is swept under the rug. Congress will do nothing, the country goes back to status quo, alt-right will cite it as another Antifa/ISIS hoax, and we'll wait till the next mass shooting just to repeat the never ending cycle. "

'>Flynn\'s tenure in the White House and his firing by Trump are among the topics Mueller’s team has been asking witnesses to discuss, and they are likely to be part of any questioning of the president. Separately, Mueller is expected to want to ask Trump about his firing of Comey.

Trump has repeatedly called the investigation a "hoax" and a "witch-hunt."\n\nAnd to think, if Trump had [listened to Obama] (https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/obama-warned-trump-against-hiring-mike-flynn-say-officials-n756316) and *not* hired Flynn, none of this may have happened. But that would have required Trump to take the advice from a ***black*** man.'
'Remember that story from ~~months ago~~ 12 hours ago about how Trump asked McCabe who he votes for and has pretty much hated him ever since?\n\n> In recent weeks Trump has taken aim at **McCabe, whose office first arranged Flynn’s FBI interview.**\n\nI wonder if this has anything to do with those feelings.

">Flynn's FBI interview on Jan. 24, 2017, set in motion an extraordinary sequence of events unparalleled for the first year of a U.S. presidency.

Or is this just brigading?\n\nEdit 2: I wasn't very clear with my original post. Here's what I meant:\n\nMccabe is a potential witness in this case for several reasons, the largest of which is that he is a senior member of the FBI involved in the investigation but also because he was involved in Flynn's interview and he will probably testify to the President asking him about his personal political views. Understanding that he is a potential witness, the President has been attacking him personally as well as his professional credibility publicly and loudly. That is potential witness tampering.\n\n"

"> By Oct. 1, the McCain and Cardin-penned sanctions bill required the administration clarify which targets would be identified and punished as part of Russia's defense and intelligence sectors.\n\nWait, what? They're letting *him* choose which Russians to punish? It should be easy enough to find a list of Daddy Putin's domestic enemies to throw under the bus. How does this make sense?"
'Trump will never implement those sanctions. And the coward Republicans will never force him to do so or remove him from office with the 25th Amendment if he does not.'
'> McCain scolds Trump for missing Russian sanctions deadline\n\nAnd furrowed his brow deeply.'
"I'm glad we're starting to see more attention being brought to this. I was worried he was going to get away with just quietly ignoring it. Hopefully he won't instead just get away with loudly ignoring it."

'Here is where the perjury usually happens.'
"Trump is going to get eaten alive if he's interviewed. After fire and Fury, it's clear Trump has no clue what truth is. It simply doesn't matter to him because he doesn't grasp the consequence of it. "
'What we need to do is spread the idea that Trump is too much of a pussy to meet with Mueller alone. '
'Trump: I plead ALL of the amendments. Some lightweights think the 5th is THE only impontant one. Sad! I know the Cornstitution better than perhaps anyone in history. Fake "lawyers" will see! '
"If Trump wants to prove there's no collusion, now is his chance."
'So trump actually is going to at least make a statement in some form to Mueller. That means at the very least, we’re guaranteed charges of false statements/perjury!'
"Who's willing to bet he'll try to fire Mueller during the interview, just as he starts getting uncomfortable?"
'Oh poor Mueller, having to listen to that verbal diarrhea for an hour or more. '
'I would give everything I have for a full length, unedited, 4K video of Trump being interviewed under oath.\n\nCan you just imagine the volumes of shit that would pour from Trump’s grotesque mouth like a broken sewer pipe as he wilted under the quiet, meticulous gaze of a man like Robert Fucking Mueller?'
'With his verbal diarrhea and inability to filter, Trump is the textbook example of why people should never voluntarily talk to the police.\n\nThis should be good.'
'If they aired this live, I would miss my own funeral to watch it.'
"So when Trump said he was a 'stable genius', he meant the type of 'stable genius' that can't be trusted not to incriminate himself out of sheer dumb fuckery."
'trump is going to fuck himself hard. '
"No collusion, no collusion, you're the collusion."
'This idiot will have perjured himself within the first 30 seconds'
"Trump's lawyers could not be so foolish as to let Trump speak on the record with Mueller. Trump is walking perjury. If Mueller gets a chance to question him, Trump will happily put his neck in the noose. He's too stupid not to."
"There's no legal benefit to him doing an interview. Any other politician (like one interested in continuing their career) might want to but I don't think he cares about that enough to risk this. However, if we make fun of him and say his lawyers are handling him he might sneak away and say some shit just to show everyone he's in control."
"I smile thinking of how Mueller will have to keep a straight face while asking Trump questions. I mean, short of his name, he's going to lie his ass off about every single thing asked. He's not even capable of telling the truth, probably because he believes his lies ARE the truth."
'Trump interview under oath = instant perjury. '

'It\'s almost as though "America First" was a bunch of bullshit all along.'

'I remember the Steele dossier saying something about  how Trump would rather have the public know about his Russia ties, and get distracted from his much more questionable/extensive ties to China.'
'Spoiler: Everything trump says is because his base laps it up. He even broke his thought process down on the "drain the swamp" vernacular.'
"The sad thing is that if anything is going to bring down Trump in the eyes of his supporters, it will be this. Not the corruption, collusion, racism, sexism, transphobia, etc. - No, it will be doing something that benefits people who aren't white Americans..."
'I am not a Trump supporter, However I do work for a company in the US that is affected by the ban on ZTE. ZTE buys from US companies to the tune of over $2B. Working out a deal with ZTE is not about saving Chinese jobs, but also American jobs of the eco-system that supplies ZTE.'
"His base will be pissed. That's all I care about."
">It would be difficult to find a more quintessential example of the kind of troubling trade practices that the president has long highlighted, which makes his sudden pivot in the case of ZTE all the more stunning.\n\nAll they had to do is sweet talk him a little bit.  He's the fucking mark on a used car lot"
'Anyone surprised? His MAGA hats were made in China ffs'
'My guess is that there were some shady dealings between trump and these guys at ZTE and it ended badly. So right before Trump goes down, he shines some light on them by mentioning they are losing jobs out of the blue. Now everyone wants to know why he cares about them, but it turns out he actually doesn’t.'
'So he threaten tariffs on items we need but then bails out an obvious bad player who spies on Americans\n\nAnd people are still supporting this assclown '
'Which party was again who pushes for immigration and refugees destroying competitive pay and low skilled job markets?'
'God damn I used to work with ZTE closely here in the US. They sucked so bad.'

'Another cry baby. '
"Why, because he doesn't conform to the anti-American, globalist agenda?\n\nHe's not going to be impeached, and he has the Republican establishment by the balls. We're loyal to him and not their party, and if they betray us, they'll be slaughtered in the midterms by Democrats or simply primaried."
'You can smell the fear, they know that time is running out.'
'I am not sure the Republican congress has been waiting with bated breath for Robert Reich to weigh in on this.'
"What nonsense.\n  \nImpeached for what? \n  \nBecause you don't like the guy or don't agree with his policies (for the record, I don't either). If it was that easy to impeach a President Obama would have been out within two years.\n  \nFor impeachment to even be considered there has to be a crime involved. **As of now**, we don't know of any."

People could read it and discuss the nuance of the policy. No one would agree with 100% of what an article said, but they wouldn't flat out deny it. The age of Trump is scary, showing how prone the base is to manipulation. If someone with the same idealology as trump but more subtle and better able to spin stories came to power, could you imagine how terrifying that would be?

They are joined by foreign governments like Russia and China that want their share of power to rob the world by limiting the power of America. Trump in his stupidity and greed is only too happy to oblige.\n\nThe Republican Party is thoroughly corrupted and must be razed. The first step is this November.

'"They won\'t have anything to worry about as long as they aren\'t breaking any laws."    Their own words.'
'On Wednesday night- on CNN- Leonard Bernstein (coincidentally) mused that “these are Trump’s [equivalent of the Nixon’s] tapes,” (referring, solely, to presumed documents from the FBI’s raid of Cohen’s office/house; as no one knew about tapes at the point). What an example of foreshadowing... \n\nI’ve lost count of all of the Watergate parallels at this point... \n\n\n\n'
'Why are they worried? Something to hide?'
'And I wonder why they would be worried about that.'
'I wonder if the people polled understood the gravity of the question. If the pollsters used word like "suspend" or "cancel" instead of "postpone," would we see different results? Because that\'s what postpone really means. Elections are non-negotiable and must continue uninterrupted, despite external circumstances, otherwise we don\'t have a country anymore. They must be as reliable as death, taxes, and Seinfeld reruns. '

"Has anyone asked how many would support him declaring himself dictator? Judging by comments online, it may be nearly that high as well.\n\nWhat is going on is not normal. Conservatives freaked out about a cult of personality surrounding Obama, but I think we see that's projection. It wasn't the left who were blindly following Obama, it is the right hooking onto to a reality TV star they believe is working for them. \n\n\nI'd have much more sympathy for these Trump supporters if Trump wasn't so clearly a con-man playing them for fools. They honestly think they know him because they've seen him so much on tv. They like him. They like his whining, they like his complaining, and they don't care if he lies and steals. \n\n\nWorse than their opinion of Trump, they have absolutely no respect for the government or the presidency. They've spent years watching Fox News make up crap about Obama, and listened as millionaire talk radio hosts degrade every facet of government. They don't mind when Trump lacks dignity or has nor morals because they honestly believe he's no worse than the other presidents. That's how absurd this is. They really believe that. \n\n\nThese people are so confused, and we're finally starting to see the ultimate cost of sophisticated rightwing propaganda for the past 20 years. A good portion of the electorate are so disaffected they don't mind if a billionaire tv personality ditches democracy and makes himself king. \n\nEven when Trump leaves office, this fundamental problem will remain. Fox News et al. has turned a good portion of the population anti-democratic, anti US. "
"God, we're in deep shit as a country. "
"How does a 'modern' western nation produce such utter stupidity? "
'So half of republicans polled would be perfectly fine with Trump overthrowing the government. WTF is wrong with this country?'
"All I can say is wow, they really have become treasonous if they're calling to throw out the constitutional process of elections in an effective coup, all because their party is temporarily in control of all branches of federal government.\n\nMake no mistake - any attempt to actually postpone the elections will be considered a coup of state and result in a civil war. And I'm willing to bet that more than half of Republicans aren't going to run and grab their guns to support a coup when they realize they're going to get shot back at. "
'So, one could say they hate us for our freedom?'
"These are the same idiots that believe there is no climate change, that Obama wasn't born as a US citizen, think Trump is a good businessman, etc, etc. They can support anything they want to, we will have an election in 2020. Stupid article about stupid people."
"So republicans really aren't patriots lol. They care more about beating democrats then they care about americans. They see party first country second it seems. \n\nThe difference between republicans and democrats is that democrats see republicans as americans first republicans second. Republicans only see others as republicans or deep state liberals. \n\nNo wonder the only cities that are prospering in USA are democratic.

"I get that we've had corrupt politics before, but has anyone been as brazen about their lack of ethics than Trump?  \n\nThis isn't about politics or ideology, this is just the law.  We have someone in the executive branch clearing violating the emoluments clause, accepting gifts and favors for policy.  Republicans have completely abdicated all moral and professional duties to a president who will turn on them in a heartbeart.\n\n     "

Trump vows to help save Chinese telecom jobs by helping resurrect ZTE, and then suddenly it comes out that China's fucking contributing money to a business venture of Trump's?\n\nIs this THE most brazenly corrupt thing a U.S. President has ever done? How in the FUCK are there people that still support this corrupt piece of shit?  "

"Didn't trump non\\-stop talk about China during his campaign and how they were screwing us?"
"The really sad part is that Trump is less qualified than them, and he's our fucking President."
"I cannot understand why Trump nominated so many unqualified people. There are plenty of staunch Republican attorneys who are well-qualified who would relish a judgeship. \n\nThere must be some bizarre litmus test that Trump is using or some specific agenda that he's pushing with these guys. "
'The ability to feel shame is a rare quality in anyone connected to Trump.  '

"When George W Bush was nominating people for the federal courts I didn't like any of them because of their ideologies, especially Scalia But I recognized that in the vast majority of cases, they were qualified to be on the bench and knew what they were doing.\n\nNot so with Trump. I could see one nominee slipping through who wasn't qualified, but it seems like nearly every one of them has been. I believe this is by design, not by accident."
"And this isn't even the fucking ghost hunter who's never tried a case "
"Starting to believe Trump's judicial appointments will wreak havoc on this country for decades to come.."
'At least he has shame'
'Good. This makes Trump look even more of an idiot. '

"Multiply this embarrassment by the number of vacancies Trump is filling and if you didn't know then, you'll know now why this country is completely screwed."
"Why accept being nominated for a job you're unqualified for?\n\nI used to work for a music instrument distributor that was next door to some kind of investment firm. They had a cafeteria we were welcome to patronize, and several times I shared a table with some of the suits. In conversation one day, one of them half-heartedly offered me a job.\n\nI tried to explain to him that he'd need to train me on every aspect of his industry, then deal with me being slow with math, intolerant of suits & ties which I find highly uncomfortable, and pathologically incapable of doing anything productive before 11:00 AM, assuming I've had enough caffeine. He gave me that wannabe Alpha nonsense about setting myself up for failure -- as if delusional confidence was all one needed to manipulate the value of stock portfolios. I should have asked him to pass the salt ... *with his mind*.\n\nWould I have liked the money? Yes. Would I have enjoyed dressing up in a costume and being embarrassed by a building full of financial whizzes, then soon being fired for being a fucking moron at the job? Not one bit.\n\nThis is why I don't hit on super hot women. I know my limitations and how much ambition I can afford given my resources."
'Of course he did. Quite apart from his lack of legal chops, anyone capable of feeling shame is manifestly unqualified to be involved in any way with the Trump administration.'
"He was more unprepared for that hearing than Gary Johnson was for this 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nI wonder why he thought he had a chance of getting the job.\n\nI wonder why Trump's staff did.\n\nDidn't they think they would look at his record and ask him some basic questions?\n\nI almost felt bad for the guy, watching him struggle."
"I'm actually optimistic about this.  It means Congress is actually doing its job and not just rubber-stamping Trump's nominees.  The Senator that completely destroyed this unqualified nominee was a *Republican*!  \n\nI think there are still many senators and representatives who take their responsibilities seriously and aren't just in it for partisan bickering."
"I'm surprised the poor fellow figured out how to withdraw."
"Yeah, I don't remember Trump supporting him. Do you?"
'Don’t let this distract you from the fact that FBI/DOJ forensic accountants are poring over this traitor’s financials. '
'They broke up. 😭'
"Maybe he'll delete his account if he loses in 2020."
'What a bitch. '
'The only thing Trump ever learns from his mistakes is how to revise history.'
"Ah. The old good news, bad news bit. The good news is that the candidate supported by the Orange One got clobbered. The bad news is that Roy Moore won. For example, he wants to get rid of federal judges who don't put his version of god over the US Constitution. Don't believe for a second that the enemy of my enemy is my friend."
"So the whole Presidential Records thing where he's not supposed to be deleting tweets, we're really just ignoring that now?"
'Has anyone ever seen a worse "Choice A or B" as was with Roy Moore and Luther Strange? My god, Alabama.'
"After just watching The Vietnam War on PBS, Trump's actions are so reminiscent of the Nixon era.  We can only imagine what is really going on behind the scenes,  and when and how it will all finally come to light."
'This guy is a fucking clown holy shit'
"Wasn't he told to stop deleting tweets?"
'Deleting your posts is a pussy move. People are wrong occasionally. Take it and move on.'
'We have always been at war with Eastasia.  \nTrump always supported Roy Moore. '
'This is the behavior of a teenager. Didn\'t get my way? Whoops let me delete my tweet to leave no evidence of my stance. Steph doesn\'t want to come over? He\'s not invited anyway. My "friend" isn\'t popular/didn\'t win homecoming king? Ew, what a loser IDK him.'
'What a pathetic child '

"[Here's a signed statement](http://www.withdreamers.com) from 1,850 governors, state attorneys general, faith leaders, police chiefs, sheriffs and civic leaders urging Trump to keep the program.\n\n[Here's a letter](https://pennstatelaw.psu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/pdfs/Immigrants/LawProfLetterDACAFinal8.13.pdf) from over 100 law professors saying DACA is legal.\n\nUse these in your discussions with racist xenophobic dipshits. "
"Easily.  Try this.  Bring up the ending of DACA as a good thing for the US at your neighborhood BBQ tomorrow.  Seriously, play devils advocate.  \n\nIf you don't get unanimous looks of disdain and become an immediate outcast, you're living in the wrong neighborhood.  \n\nNow apply that to the President of the United States.  Who is not only making the same argument, but unilaterally just saying 'this is now the law'.   \n"
"If Congress fails to stop this idiocy, I hope America's students will take direct action to prevent the arrest/deportation of their classmates who fall under DACA. Young people have a moral obligation to stand together in the face of ignorance and hatred."
">“We are gonna deal with DACA with heart,” Trump pledged at a news conference \n\nCondemning almost a million people on such short notice. People who grew up as Americans, now subjected to a life of fear and uncertainty. Definitely a heart felt way to deal with the matter. Promise them hope and then stab them in the back. Guess that's one way to touch their hearts..."
'This is what happens when you over empathize politics. These people are ILLEGAL and do not belong in the country nor do we need them. The US isn\'t a charity organization and these people are not our responsibility. Claiming that it\'s "mean" to deport illegal aliens is nothing more than an appeal to emotion and needs to be dismissed as such. These people knew what they were doing giving their information to the government and now they\'re paying the consequences '
'how fucked are we really? my brother is apart of DACA and i fear for him, he came here when he was 3 and he is about to buy a house,he has a great job and wife and kid.'
'Sanders apparently needs a lesson in US History just as badly as he needs a lesson in economics.'
"Good thing we didn't elect that socialist twat huh"
'So Mexico gets to take 800,000 skilled workers for free, and it won\'t stop a single illegal immigrant from coming back the other way? Sounds like a typical Trump "win", insofar as it\'s a total failure of a policy that could only have been dreamt up by a fucking idiot.'
"This sort of hyperbole is why the right felt they had to elect that idiot.\n\nHere's what really happened.  Trump kept Daca.  But 9 attorneys general were filing a lawsuit on Monday if Trump didn't get rid of it.  It looked like they'd win if they filed that lawsuit.\n\nThe reason was this was an unfunded mandate that was made by executive order.  People up to the age of 30 can stay in the country undocumented under that program.  And those 9 states pay most of the costs.  The attorneys general just got tired of paying out of their states' funds for something that should be paid for by the whole country, not just a few states.  So they would have filed suit, gotten the rule termed unconstitutional, which would have been easy, and that would have been it.\n\nStill not wanting to get rid of it, Trump has announced it will end unless congress acts.  So the left shits all over Trump.  Trump had no choice.\n\nSo the left again shames the right and the right is frankly getting tired of that tactic.  This is why they voted Trump.\n\nHere's the deal: congress can either fund it or get rid of it, but this has to be a national decision, not something some unlucky states have to pay for."
'Right up there with the Trail of Tears'
'Another controversial move to take the press and media focus off of the looming investigation.'
'Seriously. He hasn’t said a word about Avenatti as far as I know. Probably scared of whatever is on that cd.'
"Hm. If this won't get Trump to tweet at him, nothing will.\n\nI very much want to see Michael Avenatti publicly humiliate our Commander-in-Thief."
'Avenetti is my favorite character.  Seriously, how can you not love this motherfucker?'
'Hey Trump, want to prove you have big hands? You should insult Avenatti.\n\n*cackles in glee*'

"It's a simple reason why actually.\n\nTrump has Avenatti blocked"
'The trap is set.'
'Picture Avenatti as Calvin hiding behind a tree holding a string connected to a stick holding up a box. '
"This is some PRIME trolling of a deadbeat narcissist... I'd be willing to bet Trump falls for the trap. "
'Bates the hook, casts the line, now it’s just a matter of time before the dumbest fish in the ocean swallows.'
'When I first read this I thought it was just a rapid response aimed at asserting his (Avenatti’s) superior position of strength.\n\nBut now I am sure it isn’t. That is a prepared line.\n\nI bet he has something physical that he is threatening Trump with. Something relating to Trump’s ass. A picture, a video or maybe a recording of Trump being spanked. Remember right at the beginning? Avenatti showed a DVD with no hint as to what was on it.\n\nI am looking forward to the big reveal in due course.'
'He’ll goad Trump into tweeting some admission of guilt. '
"It's getting to the point where I think I want Avenatti's dick in my mouth "
'What kind of shitty fucking charity wastes money on events at an extremely overpriced resort?'
'Good.  Let that stupid empire crumble.  And let everyone think "dirtbag" anytime they hear the name Trump.'
"I'll never give money to these charities, now that I know they were giving it to Trump in the first place. I'm glad people are pissed at Trump now, but if you didn't have a problem with him raping women and making fun of handicapped people, I'm not really impressed that you've taken a stand against anything that's come since. "
'This is what gets his attention - losing money.'
' Sadly,  this might be the one thing that forces Trump to, at least publicly,  change his position. '
"I don't know how I'd be able to go on living if every week was worse than the last.  I guess Trumpula has me beat on that."
'BOYCOTT all trump properties. '

'The hypocrisy of Republicans is sooooo SOOOO insane. '
"This most recent Stormy Daniels lawsuit is a much bigger deal than the media is painting it as. \n\nIt's a cleverly constructed trap for Trump that will force him into a no-win situation - to either allow Daniels to disclose the material evidence she has on him, or to admit that he is in fact the mysterious 'David Dennison' in the agreement drafted by Cohen - allowing him to enforce non-disclosure but at the cost of admitting guilt. \n\nThing is, this isn't something the media has picked up on widely yet - it's based on an analysis by lawyer Andrew Torrez, as discussed on his podcast opening arguments:\n\nhttps://openargs.com/oa154-stormy-daniels-is-a-legal-genius/\n\nIANAL, but to me his breakdown and explanation seemed very plausible. As someone who has listened to his podcast for a few months now, he is certainly no fan of Trump, but neither is he given to hyperbole, conspiracy theories, or wild speculation.\n\nTLDR: Media personalities need to be asking Trump one question, and one question only: are you David Dennison?"

They wouldn't include value based assessments because that's not what notes like this are for. They're for remembering as much as possible about facts. Comey wasn't interviewing Trump about collusion in the meetings these memos memorialize, so what the heck are people talking about?\n\nAre folks so desensitized by now that the very idea that a POTUS was directly speaking to law enforcement about investigations into his staff is now OK? If these memos were released in June 2017, they would have been devastating, but our collective bar on what we accept as normal keeps dropping. "
'Let\'s all appreciate for a second that the moron GOP members of congress leaked these after getting them from DOJ to try and discredit Comey. These **do not** accomplish that. All they do is make Trump look like a senile old man (in some parts), and like a scummy crime boss (in all of it). If this was the "smoking gun" to discredit Comey, they are bigly fucked.'

'This is a big fucking deal. Trump is lying about his visit to Moscow to Comey. I actually believe the golden shower thing is for real now. '
'I know Trump is guilty of collusion because he has specifically said “no collusion” more times and more consistently than anything else.\n\n'
'Yeah, god forbid the FBI investigate a President who has been part of over 4000 lawsuits. '
'The narrative being thrown out is that Trump was suspicious of Flynn\'s judgment. (AP\'s headline: "Comey memo: Trump complained about Flynn’s ‘judgment issues’") [And yet Trump was calling up Flynn at 3 am to ask him about shit that was clearly outside his expertise around this time](https://www.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_589a45f1e4b04061313a1fbb):\n\n>President Donald Trump was confused about the dollar: Was it a strong one that’s good for the economy? Or a weak one?\n\n>So he made a call ― except not to any of the business leaders Trump brought into his administration or even to an old friend from his days in real estate. Instead, he called his national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, according to two sources familiar with Flynn’s accounts of the incident.\n\n>Flynn has a long record in counterintelligence but not in macroeconomics. And he told Trump he didn’t know, that it wasn’t his area of expertise, that, perhaps, Trump should ask an economist instead.\n\n>Trump was not thrilled with that response ― but that may have been a function of the time of day. Trump had placed the call at 3 a.m., according to one of Flynn’s retellings ― although neither the White House nor Flynn’s office responded to requests for confirmation about that detail.\n\nSo make of Trump\'s "doubts" what you will.'

He will continue to weaponize Twitter and actual fake news (ex: Breitbart, NY Observer, tabloids, etc.) That "kicking and screaming" could deal even more damage to our democracy.\n\nThat\'s why it\'s so essential to have a vital smoking gun.\n\nJust remember, Bill Clinton 100% broke the law. He absolutely lied under oath and attempted to obstruct the investigation. Sure, he lied about a blowjob, but that\'s still perjury, and he still survived.

"Dotord... a great day for democracy is when you and your corrupt organization is thrown out by Mueller. Shame on GOP morons for allowing this to happen. He wants to let go a serious crime by Flynn, but wants to fire some career employee to deprive him of hard earned pension. Don't worry about McCabe. He will do just fine. One serious book deal to spill beans on all that happened would earn him 1000 times more than that pension. Eager to read that book. Of course, his appearance in front of Mueller."

I love how people wanted an outside of the establishment non career politician because of corruption and what not and then they put Donald “The Dolt” Trump in office. A person who is probably more corrupt then anyone to ever live. What a bunch of dolts.

The Iran Deal guaranteed a nuclear armed Iran after 2025, which also guaranteed the rapid proliferation of nuclear weapons as Saudi Arabia armed itself (via Pakistan). Which meant a nuclear armed Iran, nuclear armed Saudi Arabia, nuclear armed Qatar, nuclear armed UAE.\n\nThat would have been Obama\'s legacy.\n\nReturning Iran to the threat that if they attempt to develop nukes, the US and Israel will stop them, is better. They don\'t have a neighboring China to guarantee their safety like the DPRK did.

"While I'm not a Trump supporter and my first thought was another anti Obama deal. I actually understand his decision. I didn't see it in the article but the reasoning behind this decision. The original deal was the costs were to be split three ways. Between New York, New Jersey, and the government. Both New York and New Jersey both put in a request asking for federal funds to cover their cost. Basically asking for the government to cover the entire cost. Instead of agreeing, Trump said no to having the entire cost covered by the government.\n\nI am aware he wants to do a huge infrastructure deal for 2018. So this anti infrastructure but his idea of infrastructure may or may not include subways. There may be funding for this subway in the new bill but only what the government was going to give originally. That all remains to be seen. But as of right now as much as I hate to say it, Trump made a decent decision for now. "

Every 70 year old is cognitively decayed to some extent.\n\nWhat makes Trump look demented even for a 70 year old is that he, as part of his shtick I guess, doesn't prepare for ANYTHING -- interviews, stump speeches, debates, meetings, etc.  No other President in history would allow a full transcript to be released of an interview for which he was unprepared.  This is why Reagan's Alzheimer's was able to be fully concealed throughout his entire presidency.  \n\nAlso as someone who has read transcriptions of spontaneous conversations...you'd be shocked at how incoherent oral conversations are when literally transcribed, even during routine activities -- talking to friends, or when your boss asks you follow up questions about some project you did at work, etc.  "

'>quote One trick is to tell \'em stories that don\'t go anywhere, like the time I caught the ferry over to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so, I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time. Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on \'em. "Give me five bees for a quarter," you\'d say. Now, where were we? Oh yeah, the important thing was I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn\'t have white onions because of the war. The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones..\n\nIt\'s scary that this quote could be from the POTUS instead of a senile cartoon character from a TV comedy.'
'Except that that’s the way he’s always talked — rambling and disjointed, unless he has a script in front of him. So there’s no “decline”. This is the same guy who got elected.'
'I think someone used an asterisk after president ("President*) to replace "Mr. Trump". That was annoying to read through all the instances of President*, thinking there would be an annotated note at the bottom of the article for some reason.'
'If Republican leadership is able to maneuver a bad medical report to come out about him, then their whole Trump problem could go away pretty quickly'

"Almost? Literally every single thing we know about Putin tells us he's a liar. In fact, Icarus was like, released just this week or something about how Putin cheats his way to gold olympic medals."
"It's weird how absolutely no one who was at that meeting seems to know why they were there. "
"Do you ever wonder what Trump honestly thinks the end game on the investigation is? For real, does he think the investigation won't end his presidency immediately? There are just so many brutal and incriminating pieces of news, surely he must realize the investigation will bury him. In reality, he'll probably just resign before any of it happens because he is an absolute coward. Still. \n\nAlso, I had a pop tart this morning at about 7:15. It wasn't actually a pop tart, but I have been in this situation before and I am unsure as to what I need to say. "
'"Almost definitely"...Holy fuck they said that'

That's the future of the USA and the rest of the world, under this sort of economic ideology.\n\nTrickle-down doesn't work, because the people who are supposed to let that money trickle down don't want it to.

"Taxation only reached insufferable levels after the establishment of the Federal Reserve. America didn't have an income tax until 1913. Perhaps the dilemma shouldn't be around how much people or corporations should be taxed, it should be about what and how the tax money is being used. It should be about why wage growth has stagnated, while inflation of the dollar has exploded since the Nixon Shock in 1971, stripping away the buying power of the middle class. You could raise a family comfortably with the today's money back in the 40\\-60s.\n\nPerhaps if the USA stop meddling in other country's politics and development, stop overspending the next 20 countrys' cumulated military budgets, then we have more money to work with domestically.\n\nThe majority of people are too focused on the surface problem of taxation, rather than the root causes."

Kushner Urged Trump to Fire FBI Director Comey: Reports
25 House Dems to White House: Fire Jared Kushner Immediately
Jared Kushner can't pass his security clearance investigation, officials say
"If, as Kushner's lawyer says, losing the clearance doesn't affect his ability to work, why was he accessing classified information in the first place?\n\nAs his lawyer has now admitted, Jared's previous access to classified information was unnecessary and outside the scope of his employment."
'When is he getting arrested is what I want to know next?\n\n'
'Interesting. This makes kushner pretty much worthless now. Either A: trump gives him his clearance back or B; he rage quits.'
"No wonder Kushner's assistant resigned."
'Wow, only a year late. That fucking criminal should have never got clearance to begin with. '
"Oh boy, this is going to cause the Kushner faction and the John Kelly faction of Trump's White House to come to a head.\n\nRumors had already been swirling of Kelly being on his way out either through resignation or because Trump is thinking of firing him, with this move I imagine either he or Kushner will be thrown under the buss by F5 o'clock tomorrow. "
'He\'s in a room somewhere In the White House sulking while Eric Trump is showing him his drumset and saying "DO. NOT. TOUCH. MY. DRUMS."'
'Fuck you Jared. I hope you spend the rest of your miserable existence in a cell rotting next to your slime bag father.'
"How confident are we that this indeed occurred? We didn't hear anything about it when the deadline came up on Friday and throughout the weekend until now (Tuesday). They have been lying since the beginning, how sure are we they are not lying now?"
"So this means now no one is reading the President's Daily Brief anymore?"
'Inb4 Kushner just fucking looks at the stuff anyway. I mean obviously. \n\nDoes anyone think we have any way to stop him?'
'How relevant is his loss of access when his wife still currently has top-secret clearance? Ivanka can just tell him anything'
"This is a big deal.  Trump OK'ed Kushner, and now the internal machine overruled that.  Trump should have the authority to determine who can see what.  This suggests that Trumps losing grasp on his WH power."
'Does anyone think he is not going to still get secret clearance shit? The trump administration doesn’t follow laws or protocol..\nThis won’t change a thing'
'Why the fuck did he have it in the first place?'
'Wait how the fuck is he supposed to finance all of that real estate without government secrets to sell?'
"Downgraded to secret! HA\n\nNow he's level with every other military member. Useless clearance basically."
'The really bad part is that it will be YEARS before we find out if this debt ridden blackmail-able knob took advantage of this access to America’s top secret files and reports. \n\nThis administration is on the cusp of taking more than a decade to clean up after. \n\nThey’re like a bad termite infestation in a building made of wood. \n\n\nFuck. '
">The president has the ability to grant Kushner a permanent clearance, but Trump said Friday — the same day the memo was sent — that he was leaving the decision to his chief of staff.\n\n>“I will let General Kelly make that decision,” Trump told reporters. “I have no doubt he’ll make the right decision.”\n\nBullshit. I'm calling it right now Rump grants him access."
'Gates charges were dropped and he plead guilty and then Kushner loses security clearance? Hmm'
"Would Trump qualify for top-secret clearance if he were forced to apply for it? I haven't heard this asked anywhere and I've been genuinely curious."
'Republicans must be going nuts over these emails. Lock him up!'
'This looks like the start of a "drip, drip, drip"\n\nKushner denies it, than some of the contents come out, and Kushner denies or admits to it, and than the full extent of it drops.'
'When Jared colluded with Russia through his work with Cambridge Analytica, that wasn’t *all that* bad.\n\nBut sending these emails... that’s absolutely *unforgivable*!\n\nJk, he has a dick and the magic ‘R’ next to his name, so those rules don’t apply to him.'
'Ah, the stench of hypocrisy...'
"I'm waiting for the Conservative outrage over this like there was over Hillary. Where's the Oversight committee?! Where's the FBI investigation?!"
'The gop is made up of unethical fucking hypocrites.'
'Let me guess, no republican outcry?? What a joke party.'
'"BUT HER EMAILS!!!"\n\n\n"Uh, sir, maybe we should stop with that one."'
'Of course he did. The emails rules are for Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, and no one else.'
'Republican hypocrisy knows no bounds.  '
'"Always accuse the other side of what you yourself are guilty of." --Mussolini'
"It's pretty inconvenient for Kushner that all the connections that he forgot to disclose are ones that look bad for him."
'What the fuck did this guy even PUT on his disclosure forms in the first place?!'
'Just throw it on the treason pile over with the others.'
'I honestly think his disclosure was just the following, written in crayon:\n\n"I FUCK IVANKA. I DO WHAT I WANT."'
'What is that now? Failure to disclose #8931? This guy is racking up a lot of federal offenses.'
'Why the FUCK does he still have security clearance.'
"No ties to Russia, no ties.  You're the ties!"
'Another blatant reason to deny him a clearance or a job in government. They should be filling charges against him at this point. '
'My grandfathers (both WWII vets) would be calling for the rope for the whole GOP.  What a shitshow of bullshit. '
'What the fuck did this guy actually disclose?   A blank sheet of paper with his name at the top?'
'Revoke his clearance immediately. Prosecute this fool.'
'Where are all these “LOCK HER UP” people when you really need them. They show up to Pizza places with rifles and say yes to Roy Moore! What the fuck is going on!?!'
"How can this keep happening and nothing is done about it? I don't understand. Like truly. Isn't there a mechanism in place to just automatically revoke clearance at this point? "
'Just a lying piece of shit... along with all his in-laws '
'Mueller is going to nail his nuts to the wall.'
"What's the deal here? Is disclosing things optional now? Seems like there should be some kind of serious and immediate consequences for failing to disclose important information. Otherwise what's the point?"
"Can't wait until they are all arrested.  What a nightmare."
'Well color me shocked.  Shocked, I say.'
"So he ends up in prison trying to do what his daddy also tried to do; if he thinks Don's going to stay loyal, he's a fool.\n\nBut he *is* a fool. He's not all that bright.\n\nThis is some Shakespeare level family tragedy right here. All because a bunch of rich people with few natural gifts decided they were geniuses who should have even more money."
'That might be why the russians and 4channers have been pushing their fake news hastag hard the past few days.'
'Just a wild prediction: if Jared turns on the administration, we’ll start to hear anti Semitic dog whistling coming from Team Trump’s surrogates within days. '
'No collusion here. Nope. Nothing to see here.'
'"A giant risk to [the bank\'s] reputation" is code for losing all your money laundering customers because of heightened oversight '
"Translation: Deutsche Bank realized Kushner's money laundering is so obvious that they came forward before they get charged too."
"Don't bother guys, didn't you hear Nunes has a memo? Crime doesn't count now.\n\n/s"
'They found the money.  Now we know why that bullshit release the memo was trending as a distraction.'
"It's kind of illegal for them not too. It's not exactly a matter of choice here; DB are not doing this out of the goodness of their hearts..."
'Can we sentence him AFTER Trump is impeached so there is no pardon?'
"In retrospect, it may turn out to have been a bad idea to launder payoffs from one of the biggest anti-NATO powers in the world through the biggest bank in a country that depends on NATO for its security. Merkel ain't about to let Putin buy himself some European chaos."
'This makes my morning waaaay better.\n\nDudes a POS, hope they find evidence enough to send his ass to prison. '
'To see Jared go down for being a criminal is great but to Jarvanka go down would be better. trump on the chopping block would be the best of course but I think seeing the daughter he covets so much end up in a orange jumper would make him lose his shit. Could you imagine the tweet storm if that happened?'
"Why doesn't Muller say yes please? Why is he just quietly lurking Reddit?"
"Jared's a coward.  He'll off himself rather than face charges."
"Does anyone know how to get rid of the video that takes up a third of the screen on mobile for all Newsweek articles? It's been annoying me for ages."
'Hahaha..just when I start to feel hopeless, I new development arises'

'Donald Trump is planning to announce a formal recognition of all of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on Wednesday, which would make it official that the United States, as a country, no longer recognizes Israeli land grabs as inherently illegal. While not all Israeli settlements are in Jerusalem, the thing that makes Israeli settlements illegal is that they are constructed by the Israeli government in parts of Palestine that were seized during the 1967 war -- including the entire Eastern half of Jerusalem, which was governed by Jordan until the war, was not intended to be divided, and has always been recognized by Palestinians as part of their nation and future state. \n\nSo by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel -- all of Jerusalem -- Donald Trump is essentially saying, officially, that the United States government will ignore one of the most central aspects of international law -- respect for borders and opposition to the conquest of land during war -- when it comes to a close US ally. Up until this point, the ardently pro-Israel Congress had repeatedly demanded the President recognize Jerusalem as the capital, and all US presidents have refused to do so out of "national security" -- i.e., that it would undermine any semblance of American commitment to international law and the international order and would make any sort of peace agreement about the future of Israel/Palestine impossible. Trump has no respect for such an order, and America\'s allies in the Arab world have never actually given a shit about the Palestinians or the beliefs of their own people anyway, so he may throw all of that to the wind. \n\nIn that sense, as much as it is ridiculous that Kushner (and Flynn and Dermer) have all advocated for Israeli settlement construction in ways that are either ridiculous or violate US law, the problem isn\'t limited to these individuals. The entire administration is married to Israeli abuses and will do anything it can to legitimate them out of pandering to domestic pro-Israel supporters. \n\nThese things can\'t be predicted but it may trigger an intifada, as well as massive upheavals throughout the Middle East and it could also trigger a further push away from the United States by other nations. \n\nThis is not a small thing. It\'s not really about Jerusalem or Palestine (which are big things in their own right). It\'s about whether or not America even cares about pretending to value international law when it governs much of the world. '

But the problem is that even if it is innocent it looks bad. This is the reason why cabinet level people are required to divest. \n\nThe one thing that is clear is that Trump is bad at hiring.

I know this has little to do with the argument, but it's silly when you think about the scale of things we're talking about."
'One of the problems with having "international businesspeople" in government is that it\'s hard to tell what\'s corruption and what isn\'t.

'> "If Jared Kushner was working for any other department in the U.S. government and these issues arose…about falsifying a clearance or omitting information…his access would be first suspended. And then if there’s no other position he could hold, he’d be out of work without pay. He’d be off the job," Joseph Kaplan, founding principal attorney at Passman & Kaplan, P.C., told Newsweek last month. "If he was anybody else, his security clearance would have already been denied."'
"I thought there was a big controversy because we couldn't figure out how he KEPT his security clearance after failing to remember all those foreign contacts and having to revise his forms multiple times. Is this gaslighting by Newsweek? "
"I think this stuff bums me out more than a lot of other stuff.\n\nI can't get clearance because I smoked some pot and had some fun in college. \n\nBut this guy can get access to classified info in spite of: clear conflicts of interest, withholding information on his OPM form, lying to investigators, etc.\n\nI guess it's true what they say: it's all about who you know, and how much money you got. \n\nEdit: Thank you for the encouragement guys. Unfortunately, when my clearance interviews came up, it was about 8 months after I had stopped. \n\nPerhaps in the future, I will be able to obtain clearance. But I doubt it.

'The blatant nepotism and corruption of this administration is absurd. I am reminded everyday to be ashamed to call myself an American. '
"Okay, bullshit aside. Why are we still okay with this? What's the point of security clearance if we shrug when someone doesn't have it? Doesn't that just invalidate the rest of the service since any can now shrug their shoulders and prance around the President?"
"So, if he doesn't have clearance, then he can't claim executive privilege when questioned by Mueller/HIC, right? "
'So trump is letting this guy into meetings with secret information? Wasn’t that the whole argument against Hillary? I wonder how many emails with secret clearance info does kushner have'
'Good. I don’t want this piece of shit knowing anything important '
'I imagine the constant lying about ties to foreign nationals is slowing things up'
"What's so difficult to understand about a corporation providing governmental services to their volunteer slave workforce?"
'In a dictatorship, the autocrat can give security clearance to whoever the hell he wants to.'
'It should be illegal.  Basically no one wants to approve him because that would probably be a criminal act, so they are perpetually delaying his denial so he can keep a temporary clearance.\n\nThe only positive is that stanch republicans with secruity clearances have to actually admit something crooked is going on.  Maybe that helps deprogram a few republicans voters.'
'How the fuck is this possible?'
"Because he's a traitor. Treason is his middle name. \n\nNever thought I'd see the day where a president with full security clearances has a senior, nay, has a top advisor, advising him who can't get his shit together enough to get one. \n\nJust how the hell does that work?  If Ivanka has one, it needs immediate revocation. She's as greedy, narcissistic and corrupt as her coughhealthycough father. "
'Maybe, no one in their right or wrong mind will clear him? Just a thought.'
'In another admin this would be a major scandal'
'So are the people getting fired for leaking classified info to Jared'
"That's fucking nuts"

">The emails—which include non-public travel documents, internal schedules and some official White House materials—were in many cases sent from Ivanka Trump, her assistant Bridges Lamar and others who work with the couple in the White House. The emails to the third account were largely sent from White House accounts but occasionally came from other private accounts, one of these people said.\n\nBut it's not like Hillary!1!1!1! /s \n\n>Kushner’s lawyer Abbe Lowell said his client “uses his White House email address to conduct White House business” and that Kushner exchanged fewer than 100 emails with White House colleagues through the personal account. In most cases, those exchanges were initiated by the other party sending a message to Kushner’s private account, Lowell said.\n\nA few dozen is a decent amount.

"Megathread: Supreme Court rejects administration appeal, must continue accepting renewal applications for DACA program",PoliticsModeratorBot,1519658045.0,33749,,self.politics,""">[WASHINGTON (AP) ](https://apnews.com/531f2f5dc4844ac082f356d53ddcc32a/Supreme-Court-rejects-administration-appeal-over-immigration) — The Supreme Court is rejecting the Trump administration’s highly unusual bid to get the justices to intervene in the controversy over protections for hundreds of thousands of young immigrants.\n\n>The justices on Monday refused to take up the administration’s appeal of a lower court order that requires the administration to continue accepting renewal applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. What made the appeal unusual is that the administration sought to bypass the federal appeals court in San Francisco and go directly to the Supreme Court.\n\n**Please keep discussion on topic, and limit thread noise.

I’m Senator Ed Markey and I’m forcing a vote in the U.S. Senate to save net neutrality. We’re one vote away from winning. AMA.,SenatorEdMarkey,1525887279.0,27630,,self.politics,"""In 2018, access to the internet is a right, not a privilege. [That’s what net neutrality is all about](https://youtu.be/ltzy5vRmN8Q). It is about the principle that the internet is for everyone, not just those with deep pockets. It is about the public, not a handful of powerful corporations, having control. All of that is under attack. In December, President Trump’s Federal Communications Commission (FCC), [led by Ajit Pai](https://i.redd.it/r4es5z0wrow01.jpg), eliminated the rules that prevent your Internet Service Provider – Comcast, ATT, Verizon, Spectrum – from indiscriminately charging more for internet fast lanes, slowing down websites, blocking websites, and making it harder and maybe even impossible for inventors, social advocates, students, and entrepreneurs to connect to the internet. [If that sounds wrong to you, you’re not alone](http://www.publicconsultation.org/united-states/overwhelming-bipartisan-public-opposition-to-repealing-net-neutrality-persists/). Approximately 86% of Americans oppose the FCC’s decision to repeal net neutrality. \n \nThat’s why today, [I  am officially filing](https://www.facebook.com/EdJMarkey/videos/10155722134966379/) the petition to force a vote on my Congressional Review Act resolution, which would put net neutrality back on the books. In the coming days, the United States Senate will vote on my net neutrality resolution, and each of my colleagues will have a chance to show the American people whether they stand with powerful corporations or the vast majority of Americans who support net neutrality. I hope you’ll join me in this discussion about the future of the internet.\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone so much for all of your great questions! I have to go to the Senate floor to continue to fight for net neutrality. You can watch me and my colleagues on a livestream here at 4pm ET: https://www.facebook.com/EdJMarkey/\n\nRemember: we're in the homestretch of this fight. We can't let up. Please continue to raise your voices in support of net neutrality! Together, I know we can win this. \n\nProof: https://i.redd.it/v2ulhgs7row01.jpg""",8i7u5l

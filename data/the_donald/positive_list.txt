The key to a long living nation I seem to find is being as moderate as possible.

"They need to weigh this guys' balls when he dies I can almost guarantee the sheer size of them would be a record he stood up to the most powerful people on the planet and told them they were all trash lmaooo"
"The natural outcome of socialism is that those at the top will always take more than those at the bottom.  They feel they deserve it for 'running' society.  They take all the resources under their control and see soo much, that taking some to enrich themselves, seems like taking crumbs off a giant sandwich; insignificant. And the people are soo powerless to do anything about it anyways, that it doesn't matter.  \n\nIt's funny because when you think about it, they don't even follow socialism truly.  A true socialist nation wouldn't have a leader or people at the top, and would instead have normal people constantly rotating the positions that need to be filled to make society function....but even then, who gets to decide that?  Someone, somewhere.  Even if you had it run through a machine to random pick people, there's no guarantee it isn't rigged and no guarantee they will leave those positions.  Whoever can force them to leave, is then the one with the most power in society......and then they will eventually abuse it.  That's the thing about power in socialism.....somewhere, at some point, it all comes down to the actions/decisions of one person, which is what leads to a dictatorship even if that wasn't the original intent.\n\nThen they turn it into multi generation leaderships that are passed down from father to son.  But that's just one of the fundamental reasons why socialism is doomed to fail on inception.  \n\nTo run a nation, you need people making decisions, and inevitably one person is going to have the most pull, the most power, to make the final decisions.  The pure idea of what they try to paint socialism as, isn't compatible with having a leadership.  True socialism in its purest ideal form would be a leadership-less society....which would make it kind of hard to function properly as a cohesive society because somewhere at some point there will be conflicts or decisions that need to be made, and someone is going to have to arbitrate/adjudicate/implement them, which gives some people power over others, which leads to those people using that power to get more for themselves and thinking that it's their right because of what they 'do for the people'.    \n\nI always think of it like this: Socialism isn't about being as wealthy as your neighbor, it's about being as poor as everyone else.  \n\nSure, the rich are on the top too in capitalist nations, but the difference is you can potentially change your living conditions, and become one of them, and even if you don't you can still end up somewhere in the middle.\n\nWithout competition there isn't incentive for advancement.  After all, it's easy to keep people like N. Koreans busy and distracted by having them toiling in the fields.  We wouldn't have an iphone if it wasn't for capitalism.  The only advancements communism/socialists make is based on the left overs of capitalists.  They only have technology because they got it from us.  And when they do make technology themselves, it's typically derived from the need to keep control over their own people, to increase the resources their people produce to further increase their control and self enrichment, and for attacking outsiders.

"Jesus Christ, what happened to Salon? Look at this:\n\n>What could be a greater indictment of identity politics than the utter hollowing-out of the Democratic Party, its rank electoral defeat at every level of government, which began in earnest with Bill Clinton‚Äôs commitment to neoliberalism in 1991-1992, going hand in hand with identity politics of a kind that had little patience with actual poor people? That period is especially revealing, because Clinton went out of his way, as he would during his entire administration, to celebrate identity politics for the right people, namely, those who are good capitalists, doing everything he could to suggest, by way of policies, that the unreformable poor were no longer welcome in the party.\n\n> The result is the evisceration of the Democrats as a party with even a rhetorical claim to the working class, as it has become a club for egotistical, self-branding urbanites who pay lip service to identity politics while having no sympathy for real wealth redistribution. This loss of even the semblance of a liberal policy framework in the domestic and international arenas continued apace during the Obama administration. Obama was immune to liberal criticism, because he fit the identity politics matrix so perfectly. He may have ruthlessly deported millions of people, kept in place and strengthened the entire extra-constitutional surveillance apparatus, and escalated illegal drone attacks and assassinations, but the color of his skin provided immunity from real criticism.\n\nFrom the second article. Seriously read it, it **slaughters** neoliberal elites.\n\nEdit: [I'm archiving this shit just in case, it's too good.](http://archive.is/ZXyr6)"

'So sad me and others called this immediately when we saw the headlines about Russia\'s facebook ads but the stories carefully admitted stating the content of those ads. It is like how the media omits the killers race you know it is a minority for sure. If the ads were pro Trump msm wouldn\'t have displayed them all or at least say so, but they had to go with "the ads were divisive" instead of saying yeah they were pro hillary and blm, oops there goes our narrative.\n\nNext MSM will probably try to pull the "Those crafty Russians are so manipulative they knew we would blame them for hacking the election so they made pro-Hillary ads to discredit us and defend themselves before they were caught" yeah ok, and people will believe that conspiracy theory worthy of Infowars.'

'This isn\'t a bombshell, and he wasn\'t "caught" doing anything.\n\nThis was a skit on his show, and the women were more than willing to play along.\n\nYou could argue he shouldn\'t be such a moralizing douche now, and that he should go back to being funny, given that this behavior doesn\'t exactly paint him as a paragon of virtue but is a bit funny.'
'man I love calling a spade a spade and calling anyone out regardless of political affiliation. The left have been hypocrites for a long time..but let\'s not be disingenuous here...in the video posted he did NOT ask an 18 year old girl to put her mouth on it, they were 2 separate girls...one he asked her age, the other girl he said "why don\'t you put your mouth on it\'.  \n\nDisgusting behavior nonetheless because Jimmy is a hypocrite...though the man show was funny as hell and clearly these women aren\'t being forced to do any of this stuff.

"The most effective way to increase the pay for low skilled jobs is to decrease the number of people who are willing to work for less than $15 dollars an hour.  If we build a wall and deport the illegals, we won't even need a minimum wage since employers would have to compete with each other to have people work for them."
"The only tenet of capitalism's is maximizing profit, NOT providing a job for everyone. Remember that! "
'They need to be able to save your order as a code like \nX234 or something simple.\n\nOr on the phone and skip the machine and pre order and pay at once.\n\nThen you walk up hit the code and confirm then pay with phone or card.'
"I guarantee that those kiosks won't mess up your order nor give you an attitude. "
"This proves the theory that low wage low skilled workers are holding back progress. Automation is the wave of the future and redundant, often poorly performing humans are in the way. This why we do not need migrants we need better robotics engineers. \n\nO V E R P O P U L A T I O N is the cause of all of the world's problems."
"I don't like it on a pure esthetics angle.\n\nThere has to be a more appealing looking solution to this.\n\nOtherwise, I honestly don't care.  I use a kiosk at the Sheetz drive up and it works just fine."
'I used those in France and liked them. Much better than ordering from the illegal who barely speaks English in Southern California '
'If you increase minimum wages prices go up. They used to call this inflation. If you double the wage then cost of living doubles. So have you really received a raise?  Fyi in 1992 you could live decently on $10 per hour 1600$ a month rent food and car! $20 would fill up a pickup truck for the entire week minimum wage was then 4-5$ per hour range'

'Na there\'s no need for basic ID. Instead we need a massive surveillance state to monitor every communication on planet earth, including all US citizens, judges, congressmen, everything. Because the russians might get into peoples heads through words and memes. Monitoring the words and thoughts of all white people on earth in case they wrongthink and become a "bot", is what we need to do. Make sure to try and manipulate everyone\'s feelings by actively paying people to "correct the record", and passively manipulate everyone\'s google searches, facebook feed, twitter trending topics and twitter feed.

"> This may sound odd, but I admire Anthony Weiner for what he did on Monday. He stood tearfully before the judge and acknowledged several compatible truths: that he was responsible for his action, that he is accepting the consequences, and that he needs help so that he can liberate himself from those compulsions, or, at the very least, stop acting on them.\n\nWhat a load of BS. Admire someone for taking responsibility for begin a pedophile? \n\nAt this rate the NYT can also Admire people that take responsibility for killing other people, or raping, or mass murdering. As long as they take responsibility. \n\nLe'ts admire people that never commit hideous crimes. "

I saw him on a YT someone linked here (please link again: it\'s like hours long but WELL WORTH IT because it has original footage), and **he look shady AF**. Before JFK even got off the plane, that bitch was boxing up JFK\'s shit basically. *Someone should\'ve done him just for looking so shady and blaming the Italians.*\n\nItalians don\'t forget slights like this. My parents, hell my **grandparents** (RIP RIP RIP RIP) and all their friends and my Godparents, they **all** say on good authority that LBJ was in on that hit and tried to blame Italians for it, when it was really (whatever spooks call their capos). ( <--- "spooks" just means spies, btw, not Brits or anything rayciss. Though they DO tend to be white guys, don\'t they? Marxists, too.)\n\nSame people probably put down Martin Luther King Jr as well. (Note I said KING, not Cream; Martin Luther Cream is a wannabe Sotero son but has too much Swede in him. 100% Swede. I hear you gotta wear shades around White Lightning or he can damage your eyes he so bright white.) But who did those 60s people blame? That\'s right: **the Italians.** Romans. HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE people (really Sicilians btw).\n\nWe\'ve got to make sure **JFK\'s legacy of GREATNESS** lives on though CIA spooks and Hitlary want to put the kibosh on JFK.'

Does a person with a 200k income qualify as "rich"? What if that person is paying off 150k in professional school debt? Not every "rich" person was born into wealth; the significant majority of them go out and earn it. If someone works 12, 14, 16 hours a day for years, doesn\'t he deserve more of his money? In fact, don\'t we all deserve more of our money? Why do we have to justify keeping our own incomes away from the thieving hand of the government?\n\n"Rich" people are not assholes. The government already robs them of far too much money, and for what? More wars and invasions? Health care for every single person who walks into this country? Free college education for any student with a pulse? How altruistic and naive must one become before realizing that you cannot finance your pet projects and bleeding heart fantasies off of the backs of people who work fourteen hours a day? '

It should arguably be higher than that, but anything less than that is a nonstarter. \n\nAs was also mentioned, strange as it may sound to someone just scraping by on minimum wage in Middle America, there are plenty of areas of the country where a household income of $225K or $275K or $310K certainly don\'t feel very "rich" once you consider property taxes, a mortgage, college funds for your kids, transportation, etc.\n\nSo this conversation starts at 1 million dollars, nothing less.

The whole night was magical in a weird way, sitting there with popcorn and some rootbeer, watching Hillary overtake in Florida, then Donald then Hillary again, then finally Donald. Once CNN started realizing even the 'firewall' states were swinging red, they stopped showing the electoral map at all, and just cut to Van Jones and his infamous 'white lash' comment. \n\nThe next few hours was the liberal panel complaining how butthurt they were, and Pennsylvania stuck at 99% for 7 hours.

'It\'s so disgusting listening to all these so called journalists bashing Trump and the WH for banning one lousy "reporter" from an event. They act like it\'s an attack on the free press when there were plenty of other reporters there. Those that cover the WH don\'t have the right to be there in that capacity. It is a privilege and if you act like an ungrateful brat, you should lose that privilege. It\'s not like all reporters were banned and things are being kept secret. Trump is the most accessible and transparent of any President in my lifetime by far. Just another phony thing for the media to whine about, but they are all perfectly fine with banning people from social media if they say something they consider wrong. I\'d argue it\'s far more important for citizens to be able to express themselves freely online than it is for 1 shitty reporter to have privileged access to the WH. '

(heavily Hispanic community) our soccer teams were made up of primarily Hispanic players and if we played a high school (predominantly white) that started chanting usa I would know it was meant to be a racist chant even though I'm a proud American myself. And root for the USA national team as a die hard. I wouldn't throw a fit about it to be honest but I would understand the underlying meaning. Now a days some people really are using their patriotism as a mask to their racism. I hope most of you aren't as I browse this sub for a different perspective. I know most of you aren't actually racist and really do love your country but I want you to see things from a other perspective. At the surface something like this may just seem patriotic but in certain circumstances we know what you really mean. "

'Was an opportunity to cash in for sleazy Russian entrepreneurs - selling bullshit tabloid stories on Donald Trump to a cabal-scheming HRC/DNC Democrats and their Obama administration Deep State cohorts.\n\nKind of like the recent punking of Democrat Rep. Schiff where two Russian journalist easily hijink their way into getting direct access to Schiff, recording the conversation, in which Schiff is desperately anxious to get his hands on Trump nudes that they claim they are peddling. (This little vignette is essentially a kind of a microcosm of the entire Russian narrative that has slow drip unwound over the last year.)\n\nIn the case of Schiff, he was motivated by desperation as his *"Muh Russian"* narrative had gone down in flames. Whereas HRC/DNC-Dems, Obama-admin/Deep-State were entirely motivated by a malicious and seditious intent from the get go - first political opposition spying and then that quickly morphing into a conspiracy of coup de\'tat post election.\n\nOf course, as more unravels on the Hillary Clinton collusion with the Russian govt. per the Uranium One scandal, and how Carter Page was a one time FBI asset in 2013 and then FBI flipped and began using him as a patsy so FBI could get a pretext to spy on Trump campaign (and then the Trump administration), it is looking like HRC has been working closely with the Russian govt. all along. So the tabloid trash that Steel put into the FusionGPS dossier really could have been fed in part by his Russian sources that were operating in their intelligence apparatus. Steel certainly never made and effort to meet and verify his sources, nor did the FBI, which took on his info and used it without verification to get FISA warrants.'

'The two best things Republicans could do now is 1) undo the alienation of the black vote, or at least black males, and 2) drop voodoo economics and pursue economic nationalist and populist economics. Economic nationalism was what Trump initially ran on and that sort of ‚Äútake care of our own‚Äù populism had some crossover appeal with Bernie voters. \n\nIn my recent conversations with American black males,  two things stick out. They tend to be socially moderate or conservative, while embracing economic populism. One ex Army male I spoke with was downright nationalist. He was fed up with the situation where people from central and east Asia are promised money and stipends here because the military paid them off for using their land to stage military operations. He was pissed that we give money to people who have no interest in assimilating - yet ignore our own. \n\nIf Republicans can build bridges to socially moderate black males and females, and their churches, we will find good allies.  \n\nBLM isn‚Äôt really aligned with Antifa. BLM just thinks they have common opposition. \n'

"What I don't understand is why lazy fat entitled illegals should be given amnesty just because they came here at a certain age. They act like they're owed amnesty like we better give it to them and advocate for their criminal parents. They are one in the same they both broke the law and continue by being here unauthorized. Most of these so called dreamers are older than me 25 or 26 they've have 7 or 8 years to get their dang butts over the border and have not done so they've willing broken the law yet we're supposed to treat these adult illegal alien like innocent children when they're guilty of living here illegal as an adult as well. No one should be given amnesty this is why we have this mess at the border and that's the reason I've felt like I can't make a second vote on our president because he never said he was going to give amnesty when he took office. Might as well have Rubio or Cruz in there at least I agree on abortion with them. That's what makes me so disappointed. Because when I actually voted in the general election there were like 2 or 3 reasons I actually decided to vote when waiting for a computer at the library was because this old lady was talking voting and Mexican immigrants reffering to illegals and that enpowered me to vote for him added to the debate on partial birth abortion and Hillary's stance on it and the fact that justice Scalia died and needed a replacement. Now I feel like there's no need or reason to vote in 2020 because he's going to legalize everyone anyhow. And the justice was picked already and Hillary's not going to be president. Even the things I agreed with him he always flips on like the death penalty and prison sentences and then he pardons that drug dealer who should have been left in prison as long as possible. I just don't feel he's what he said he was when he was running where's school choice? I mean also I don't like the stelrategy or credit not given to black Americans who did not vote or voted for him. This was a key factor in Michigan Wisconsin and Ohio especially Michigan the numbers in Detroit were low so the rest of Michigan could turn it red.  Detroit is a black city majority. Yet this is totally ignored. You aggravate that part of the country and it's sure to turn into a blue wall again. I feel like our president tries to cater to Hispanic to get their favor instead of the people that elected him. I feel he prefers the favor from illegal aliens over the people that voted for him the only reason he's here imo is because Americans put him here and in the primaries he claimed he was against amnesty which was a major role in his campaign. I feel like what was the point and why him? There were many Republicans in the primaries that would have allowed amnesty and had the same policies. So I don't get what it was all for. I feel like this next general election I am going to care as much as I cared with Romney v. Obama. I hardly noticed there was an election."

If you take any of Trump\'s speeches and every time he says "America" you edit the video so it says "white" or some grammatically correct conjugation of it, he would sound like a racist bigot.  If this editing is actually occurring inside of their minds, their behavior makes perfect sense.  If I thought we had elected a President whose campaign slogan was literally "Make whites great again" I would freak out and protest too, anyone would except actual white supremacists.  This also explains why they\'re calling us racists, because they think we\'re hearing the same thing they are when we\'re not because we don\'t have this mental illness.'

"I don't believe this- not one bit.\nEverything we know tells us the fortunes of the Clinton's-Obama's-Podesta's-Comey-Mueller ALL inextricably linked.\nThis is pure BS- Mueller might claim to go after Podesta's to lock down information and prevent it's release- solidify cover up- provide immunity and absolution\nSame as was done by Comey during the supposed server investigation.

Explain how the class is differing from its original stated objectives.  Identify something the professor said that was untrue, then disprove it.  With sources.  That should give your argument some weight.\n\nThen send your explanation to the professor and the University.  1-2 pages.  There are tons of websites that let people rate their professors.

The professor preaches about how gender is a social construct yet she demands that when a crime is reported we must immediately identify the perpetrator as male or female.

It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre drowning and clinging to each other to not drown and aren‚Äôt aware that they‚Äôll only end up drowning as a group.\n\nSummary: The memo is fake! There‚Äôs still a chance for impeachment because the Republicans won‚Äôt allow the release of the Democrat memo which is the real memo that says the Nunes memo is wrong so all we have is a fake memo and that means Hillary still has a chance to win. One quote: ‚ÄúIf you had a brain at all, you‚Äôd know this is probably a sham since there‚Äôs another memo so why would there be another memo if the first one wasn‚Äôt full of lies?‚Äù\n\nThen they went into how the investigation will go on and how Mueller will present his findings and they should keep it going till November when the results will make the most impact even though the Republican Congress won‚Äôt vote to impeach but Trump is guilty as hell and no phony memo is going to change their mind and if the findings about collusion and obstruction are really bad, it will help Democrats take back Congress.\n\nThe champagne is still in the refrigerator; it‚Äôs getting really cold; they can‚Äôt wait to open the bottle.\n\n(!!!)\n\nIt‚Äôs fascinating. They are determined to die on Muh Russia Hill; the contents of the memo mean nothing to them, because they are so invested in getting rid of the orange jerky jerk face, and they are so dedicated to Hillary, Obama, et al, that I think we could present video evidence of Hillary baking cookies mixed with the baby parts from Planned Parenthood and they‚Äôd still say she should be president because she won the popular vote and Russia hacked the election.\n\nThey‚Äôre acting as if this memo truly means nothing, and thus nothing will change, but if what we‚Äôve read is anything close to the truth, I cannot imagine how Mueller can keep going."
'I think what we all learned today is to never, ever, under any circumstances ever talk to or contact the FBI about anything ever again.  \nTerrorist plot?  Grab a firearm and handle it yourself.  \nThe FBI can no longer be trusted for anything.  \nThanks, Obama.  '

' James Comey, June 8, 2017 testimony:\n\n> The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified.  Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing.\n\n Observe: Comey testified that he saw the dossier as a "salacious and unverified" attempt to discredit the President. Therefore on January 6, 2017 he personally briefed the President on the dossier to defend the incoming President. \n\n October 21, 2016; three months prior to that briefing, the FBI/DOJ FISA warrant application depends on the same dossier in order to get a warrant to spy on Carter Page.

Between all the highway shutdowns and protesting around fairs and just otherwise shutting down traffic, they have garnered the ill will of the nation.\n\nGender - Everyone I know has been rolling their eyes at all the invented genders and most people are not that concerned about a wage gap given that women are generally already ahead when adjusting for leave time.\n\nWe live in a time where minorities, women, enjoy benefits white males do not.

This was crowded at mid-day and her husband/SO was with her.  I didn‚Äôt see it happen because the gang surrounded her and then scattered- it happened very, very fast. Her screams lasted long after they ran away like roaches.  \n\nLater, our taxi driver acknowledged attacks may occasionally happen but best not to dwell... lovely day in Paris, after all! \n\nWe travel far and frequently.

'And thats wonderful. \n\nSo many people are brainwashed by globalist fantasies and lies and cant understand this. As a nationalist, (and yes i will use that term regardless of if leftists want to claim its evil or something) i think our government, especially the president, should always have the interest of america first; Every other country should be comsidered secondary.

'5/7 perfect comment, would vote for him again.  '
"These smug European cunts who claim to be our allies built their entire welfare States on American bedrock. They live under our shield, maintain laughable ceremonial armies and use the money we spend on their defense, and that they rip off from American labor and intellectual property to prop up their welfare economies. \n\nThey got a little high on the hog though, a little cocky. Who blames them after 16 years of globalist like Bush and Obama, the latter who felt maybe it was time for America to step away from a global leadership role and allow the UN and alliances, developing nations, more of a say in the international order. \n\nNow that bedrock is sending tremors through their dependent nations. They'll fall in line, once they realize that if they don't cut is a fair share, they're going to have to run on austerity, and that won't let them keep power because taking away people's welfare doesn't exactly keep you in office. \n\nThey've become thralls, they just have to at least go through the motions of a reasonable resistance before they fall in line."

'This is really amazing.  CNN is saying that Brazile has no credibility because she worked for a corrupt organization--CNN!  But that now you can trust them to tell you that Brazile is corrupt?  FAKE FUCKING NEWS'
'> CNN‚Äôs connections to the Clintons go above and beyond a shared **progressive** worldview.\n\nI think it\'s high time to launch a campaign to stamp out the use of this meaningless, feel-good, Orwellian term, by journalists who want our respect.  There is *nothing* "progressive" about the Clintons\' worldview, or the worldviews of powerful and ruthless enablers of the Clintons and other left-wing power-grabbers.  The clueless whining/protesting/rioting masses who call themselves "progressive" are just pawns, and their vague concepts of what they mean by "progressive" are subject to frequent, unacknowledged changes as directed by their manipulators.\n\nThere\'s nothing "progessive" about old-fashioned corruption, fueled by modern communication technology and the professional manipulation of millions of "useful idiots".'

'Jeff Zucker is the biggest Hillary lover in CNN next to Wolf Blitzer and Don Lemon.'
"Donna is a one woman army.... armed with nukes.  Won't be much left of that party when things are done."
'The dnc is a failing pile of garbage, I hope they smash each other up real good in the process'

'Nah, Obamas are ready to throw Hillary under the bus if necessary now.'
'Donna Brazile and CNN are blowing every dog whistle known to man.  And the sign over her door way she is trying to call everyone back through is **"Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here"** '
'Pretty funny that CNN is trying to discredit Brazile by bringing up the fact that she leaked debate questions to Hillary, when it was CNN that leaked the questions to Brazile.'
'This comment is extremely underrated. A lot of pedes would benefit from realizing this too. Theres a reason our side is doing so well, its because the entire left has been at war with itself and somehow still doesnt realize it.'

"Why don't we see more infographics like this showing what happened and how it works?"
"In my social work and law class my law professor listed actions done by Trump, asking the class whether he was allowed to do such actions (e.g. build a wall).  It was a fair game since the class was just reviewing what can and can't be done by the a sitting president. After the little game was over I wanted to ask if we could move on to Obama's actions. But I didn't. Ironically she explained future weeks and subject matters, where immigration was one of them. A student expressed his feelings that deportation was equal to the Nazis gathering up the Jews and stripping their citizenship away. This reddit post speaks of this inane, emotional double standards of leftists."
'I hope he vetos it if congress passes it.'

Did he target the concert because country = Trump supporters, or did he go off because someone needed a distraction for a few days? A distraction from Awan, perhaps, or something worse?

"Of course the simplest answer is that the media, both left and right, have largely quit covering it because there's no credible political angle and therefore nothing for talking heads to screech at each other about and no points to be scored or agendas to be advanced.\n\nIf, after a reasonable period of time, they can't put together a coherent timeline then you've got to question the competence of the investigation. But with the number of witness interviews they'll have to conduct and hours of security footage they'll have to review, that's a process that will take a number of weeks.\n\nIf they wanted to engage in a cover-up, you'd have a simple, consistent answers being given. On the other hand early mistakes regarding the facts of the case followed by later corrections is precisely what you would expect to see in a complex, ongoing investigation."

'That was the original version. It was updated to include "under God" in 1954.'

"The original pledge if allignece didn't have that line in it. It wasn't added until the 50s."

'Its grabbing from Wiki. Just go in and add "Under God" it is a public website that has public authors. '
'I consider myself a patriot and I\'m torn on this. "Under good" was inserted in 1954. If you\'re a Christian, you\'re probably fine with or without it. It doesn\'t add much, really.'

Not as good as Google, but it doesn\'t have the shitlib bias either.\n\nI believe in Bing. It\'s a good place. They respect important days Goolag does not.'
"Originally the Pledge of Allegiance didn't have Under God. It was added later to distance even more from the communist rise. Google is just pulling one of the several revisions from Wikipedia. The United States wasn't and still isn't a Christian nation. There are plenty of non religious people in the US. "

Every private conversations between Trump and Manafort were wiretapped. That's essentially the same as wiretapping Trump.

Then we have unfunded liabilities (disability payments, retirement, pensions, etc...) that is handled by the VA. That adds a couple hundred billion alone, not to mention the cost of the VA itself. That is military spending regardless of how you want to spin it. There are dozens of other items like this you can find. \n\nBack in 2012, I heard Ron Paul state that number and didn't understand where it came from. So I began digging. A few other people did as well so I believe this stuff is available if you want to look for it.\n\nAs much as I love our military, it is an incredibly wasteful organization. Everyone knows the story of how the Army spent Five Billion Dollars ($5,000,000,000) on the camoflage they are now looking to replace because it sucks so badly. This doesn't end at the US Army. "

"He's absolutely correct. Unsubstantiated allegations notwithstanding, there were significant problems with Moore as a candidate. We *cannot* continue running candidates that are caricatures of what leftists think conservatives are. Roy Moore was a backwards thinking, evolution-denying, Bible thumping loon who believes the Constitution is second to his interpretation of Scripture. I am a Christian, but your faith CANNOT be a cornerstone of your campaign and CANNOT be a substitute for an argument.\n\nFurthermore, leftists will continue substituting arguments with allegations that are nearly impossible to prove. They now know they can try this and WIN. The best course of action is to call them out on it, deny it, and throw it back in their faces. They don't care about sexual abuse. That much is clear based on their history. Let's let them know we consider this a war as well, because they sure do."

"We're gonna pay to arm teachers when we already can't supply them properly otherwise? C'mon guys, we're better than this."
"I don't necessarily agree that arming teachers is the solution. If they want to be armed they should be allowed to be, but I think it's a little silly to think that every teacher should be armed. I think hiring private security is the way to go."
'So interesting that the Libs response to school shootings solutions is the same as the response to immigration and DACA..........."No". üòê '

'First Democrats create gun free zones.  Then Democrats shoot up a bunch of people in gun free zones, including Republican Senators.  Now Democrats want your guns.'
"That would be putting an unfair burden onto teachers. They have a right to own a gun sure, but forcing them to carry at school, put themselves in harms way, and take the life of a child? That isn't something they sign up for when they decided to become teachers. We have plenty of qualified police members who took that oath to protect and serve. In the court system we force judges to spend a few years presiding over juvenile or family law cases. I think the same thing could be implemented here where police officers have a probationary period where they work within the school for a year. It could also be a viable option for veterans when they come home. It shouldn't be seen as some lower form of policing either, protecting our nations youth is a job you can be proud of. We don't need to arm teachers we need to arm people who know what they are doing and put them into places where they can save lives. "
'This is one directive I can‚Äôt get behind. There‚Äôs no way arming teachers is the best method for thwarting school shootings.'
"Rather than arm teachers, I'd rather see more security at schools. Make it so a teacher, if they choose, can bring their firearm to the classroom. But not mandatory. "
"That's an effective cartoon "

'This cartoon guy looks just like that student/ child actor '
"Arm teachers with EXTREME vetting. Increase security in schools too. Then let's sort out this FBI incompetency and mental illness epidemic. "

"The solution is to give a kindergarten teacher a 9mm handgun to carry with her in her classroom of walking tornado 5 year olds? C'mon. Get real. That's not a solution."
"That doesn't seem like the solution as over 90% of teachers don't want to be armed. We can't force guns onto people. This solution has been discussed and detected by the people implementing it. I don't think banning guns solves things either though this is a ridiculous suggestion. "

Instead you virtue signaled to a fan base consisting mostly of hard workers who consider your sportball a three-hour vacation from the hardships of life and therefore didn\'t want it politicized under any circumstances.\n\nAnd no, being paid millions of dollars has nothing to do with being or not being allowed to speak your mind, so any cucks coming with that line of defense can fuck right off. The sportball field was Crappernick\'s "workplace" (I use that term loosely since these grown ass men are being paid millions to play a highly refined version of a schoolyard game). If you politicize the workplace, you deal with consequences, whether you\'re a construction laborer (fired) or a CEO (hit in the pocketbook by consumers who are tired of your shit and decide to go elsewhere). If you want to be active behind the scenes, good, go do that, that\'s your business. But keep your product and your politics separate. It\'s not rocket science.'

'Please note, the accumulated trade deficits of over 12 Trillion dollars mainly went to China, today our #1 geopolitical and military rival.  Thanks to this influx of cash, they now enjoy the world‚Äôs #2 economy and access to western industrial secrets - whereas before Bush 1, they were backwards and poor and not considered a major threat.\n \nThis is where ‚Äúfree trade‚Äù has taken us.  America once had a central rule - No Trading with Communists.  Leaders spoke of the importance of letting the Chinese dragon sleep.  At the time, most US consumer products were manufactured in America or imported from friendly nations who also stood against communism.  I recall from those times that the American middle class had everything it wanted easily available, and the products were of high quality generally.  We knew that our industrial capabilities provided a fortress for the nation in case of a world war - just as it did in WW2, when the factories quickly converted from producing consumer goods to supporting our soldiers with war materials.\n \nFor the sake of saving a few pennies on consumer items, this is where the globalists have taken America.  A hollow and dying industrial base, the loss of our hard-won intellectual property and manufacturing secrets, and facing a now-wealthy and dangerously empowered rival (who wields trade as just another weapon against us).'

South? Not specified,) China, Ecuador, and Vietnam.** (Interestingly, illegal immigrants from majority-ROP jihad enthusiast nations don\'t make this list.)\n\n\n\n\nAlso interesting: that website lists the top occupations that employed illegal immigrants in 2008. #1 was **Brickmasons, blockmasons, and stonemasons.** \n\n\n\n\nMy personal experience supports this: I recently had work done at my house, and hired a company of guys I know personally. I specified that I wanted no illegal immigrants whatsoever on my property, and certainly none working on this job. Surprise surprise, they subcontracted another local contractor to do the brick/blockwork, who showed up with a dozen non-English-speaking presumably Hispanic "workers" who did a rather shoddy job. They were already half-done by the time I saw this, or I would have sent them packing. Oh well, I will have to content myself with reporting them to ICE. I feel no guilt about this on any level, because I specifically requested this work to be done by Legal American Citizens only, and did not want to support illegal immigrant labor.'

In this case, it is up to local election boards to decide if they want to take them as ID - and I will bet many precincts will not be allowing them, if any of them do.  I will definitely not be the only one here watching to see if any local election boards are planning to accept them for voter registration.  Additionally, though - this story is about Lake County.

Edgar Hoover‚Äù on Trump, briefing him on salacious blackmail material fabricated by British intelligence and Clinton campaign operative Christopher Steele. It is a pure Hoover blackmail operation.\n\nComey signals to Trump, ‚Äúgive up your fantasy about cooperation with Russia and we won‚Äôt release this.‚Äù Trump doesn‚Äôt budge. The very next day the whole Steele dossier is leaked all over the international news media, accusing the President-elect of perverse sexual acts with Russian hookers. Comey admitted as much in his testimony June 8, saying **he was aware that that briefing could be construed as a ‚ÄúJ.

That's not going to scale to a real election.\n\nI live in a solid republican district.  Democrats never seriously run.  If the democrats here suddenly had a incredibly high budget, and a likable candidate, of course the margin will shrink.  Again, in a national election that money would go towards competitive races, not to ones that will certainly lose.  \n\nThe funds spent on this election were designed to spread FUD and create articles like these to distract from ongoing events.\n"

'This guy is a real example of character & integrity (NOT) - A little bedtime History story:  \n\nThe slime story starts in 1977 probably before Spez and 90+% of the people on here were born.  \n  \nHe was appointed as a Federal Judge in Florida by President Carter.  \n  \nIn 1981 he was charged with accepting a $150,000 bribe in the  racketeering case against Frank and Thomas Romano this bribe was in exchange for a light sentence and the return of their seized assets.  As a Cherry on Top he was also charged with perjury because of his testimony about the case.  \n  \nHe stayed on as a Judge  \n  \nIn 1983, he was acquitted by a jury after his alleged co-conspirator, Attorney William Borders, refused to testify in court and went to jail.    \n  \nHe stayed on as a Judge  \n  \nIn 1988, the ***Democrat Controlled*** House of Representatives took up the case, and Hastings was impeached for bribery and perjury by a vote of 413‚Äì3.   \n  \nHe stayed on as a Judge\n  \nIn 1989 he was convicted by the ***Democrat Controlled*** United States Senate - (Robert Byrd D KKK Presiding)  \n  \nHe became the ***the sixth federal judge*** in the history of the United States to be removed from office by the Senate.  \n  \nThe Senate, in two hours of roll calls, voted on 11 of the 17 articles of impeachment and convicted him on 8 of the 11  articles.   \n  \nHe was fired as a Judge - ***BUT*** -   \n  \nThe Senate had the option to ban him from ever holding Federal Office again, they did not do so.  \n  \nRemember his co-conspirator William Borders? he went to jail again for refusing to testify in the impeachment proceedings.  - ***But Wait***  \n  \nHe was later given a full pardon by President Bill Clinton on his last day in office.  \n  \nAs for Hastings  \n  \nIn 1993 the new Florida 23rd District was Created   \n  \nHastings was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1992, representing this new district which has been his (in corruption) ever since.  \n  \n2009 was a good ethical year first he voted to impeach Texas federal judge Samuel B. Kent on all four counts presented.  This was also the year that The Wall Street Journal reported that in 2008 he spent over $24,000 in taxpayer money, meant to pay for office expenses,  to lease a luxury Lexus hybrid sedan.  It was **determined** that this was a legitimate and acceptable use of Taxpayers money.  \n  \nThis guy could be the poster boy for a life of corruption and unethical behavior because in 2012 he was ranked ***First*** in all of the members of the House of Representatives for paying salaries and fees to family members, #1 out of 435 - Stellar Performance,   \n  \nAn independent report in 2012 had this nugget of interest:  \n  \nAlcee Hastings (self):\n\n‚Ä¢ During the 2010 election cycle, Rep. Hastings‚Äô campaign committee reimbursed Rep. Hastings $15,674 for travel and event expenses.   \n\nPatricia Williams (girlfriend):   \n\n‚Ä¢ Ms. Williams is Rep. Hastings‚Äô deputy district director. 6 Between 2007 and 2010, Rep. Hastings‚Äô congressional office paid Ms. Williams $622,574. 7 Her most recent annual salary was $166,000. 8 In addition, Rep. Hastings owes Ms. Williams, a lawyer, between $500,001 and $1,000,000 for defending him during an impeachment trial. \n  \n\n\n  \n'
">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcee_Hastings#Judicial_career_(1977‚Äì1989)\n\nThat's quite impressive to be honest.

"The Chelsea Clinton thing will be interesting going forward, mostly as a barometer for just how out-of-touch the Democrat Party actually is. \n\nAcross America (even among rank-and-file Democrats, I'd imagine), there is ZERO appetite for a Chelsea Clinton candidacy. Absolutely no one is demanding it. No one is looking to Chelsea for leadership or vision on anything of import. I mean, MAYBE if she finds the right state or district, she can get elected to Congress, but as far as her national campaign prospects, Chelsea's would be, much like her mother's campaign, doomed to fail before it ever began, for a whole host of reasons.\n\nSurely top Democrats understand this, just as I'm sure many of them understood it about Hillary. But they weren't strong/brave/powerful enough to convince Hillary she wasn't the national candidate America wanted and found themselves losing to Donald Trump. \n\nBy the time Chelsea decides to run, I wonder if the Democrat Party will have any adults left in it who will squash the Chelsea nonsense before it gets too big. If not, then they're gonna be living deja vu all over again as they pin their hopes to another Clinton who will inevitably go down in flames."

So the only way to make American car competitive in China is give them technology to make components and build a factory in China and help China grow GDP. God, commies are smart. "

They test the material and look it\'s the same as iran (and Israel). We either nuke Tehran or use conventional warfare and who would benefit once the dust settles?

He watched me drink, and waited for me to say something "stupid"....\nI didn\'t, and he accused me of being somebody who doesn\'t have views that are worthy of the "public" because I said that I don\'t want to run for state congress. He literally used my declination of a future imaginary state representative run as a way to call me a bigot. Even my other left winger friend agreed with me when I said that it was an unsubstantiated attack on my character. The left wingers are showing themselves. Far right vs. far left? No such fucking thing. 10,000 maybe "semi" active members in white supremacist movements around the country, and the alternative left is growing by edgelords every day.'

"That vote was telling because it wasn't like it was some huge issue for most politicians so it was really a proxy for how many members of the US Senate are bought off shills of the Foreign Interest Lobby. 98-2 is a pretty sad revelation.

'Start the trucks.  It is deporting season.   Start rewarding community members who turn in illegals.'
'They can only do one smear campaign at a time. They don‚Äôt have the energy, or the intellect, or the multi tasking skills to talk about DACA and guns at the same time. Now would be a good time to just drop Obamacare. They won‚Äôt even remember it. '
'Hopefully the media will take a breather from organizing to repeal the 2A for a few days while they organize for amnesty as these people get deported.'
'But dems care about the dreamers! (They don‚Äôt)'
"It's obvious that the Democrats are desperately scrambling in search of an issue that will get them some traction.  This is difficult for them to do, because they are genuinely opposed to essentially all policies that would help normal Americans.  If they continue to find no issue that resonates with voters, expect the 2018 elections to be nothing but personal attacks from them.  It will be all they have to run on.  "
'I predict they will suddenly care next week as we get close to expiry, and then obstruct as usual.'
'To be fair, so have I Mr. President. '
'He‚Äôs a bucket getter. Doesn‚Äôt miss a chance for a clean shot. '

"Holy Shit I was just thinking about this..  I wondered if I had missed some amazing news that it was solved and done because I haven't seen a peep about it from the left-wing crowd and *time is ticking*!\n\nSo what's this all about? They figured out that it doesn't get them votes and so they don't give a shit about the 'Dreamers' anymore?"
'Donald is giving them the jab-jab-uppercut nonstop right now.'
"Liberal judge has blocked the March 5th enforcement, so they've won for now anyway--nothing will happen to DACAs-- and can use it as a campaign issue for midterms.  Must go to Supremes for an overturn."

"Lol he's trolling with class. Awesome!"
'He just exposed the Democrats as opportunists who pretend to care as long as it garners votes.\n\nThey really are disgusting people, and I‚Äôm glad the GEOTUS called them out on it!'
'Good let it expire and start those deportations '
"gd he's keeping it real lately hahaha"
'The Democrats just want Trump out. They could care less about DACA unless they can use it for their political purposes. '
'So if the date passes and we get Supreme Court to overturn they‚Äôd all immediately be going right?'
'They‚Äôre focused right now on milking the deaths of schoolchildren'
'Burrrrned. Gun control is way more interesting to them than DACA. Dems would probably deport everyone if it meant they had an opportunity to grab some guns. '

"Not a bad idea, at least as long you don't bow to pressure when high-ranking journalists tell you to change the scores. "
'Online voting sites are easy to manipulate.'
"I'd also like to see a site that links retractions and corrections to their original stories and make ratings based on that. So they can't quietly publish them, a site that brings them front and center."

"They need to weigh this guys' balls when he dies I can almost guarantee the sheer size of them would be a record he stood up to the most powerful people on the planet and told them they were all trash lmaooo"
"The natural outcome of socialism is that those at the top will always take more than those at the bottom.  They feel they deserve it for 'running' society.  They take all the resources under their control and see soo much, that taking some to enrich themselves, seems like taking crumbs off a giant sandwich; insignificant. And the people are soo powerless to do anything about it anyways, that it doesn't matter.  \n\nIt's funny because when you think about it, they don't even follow socialism truly.  A true socialist nation wouldn't have a leader or people at the top, and would instead have normal people constantly rotating the positions that need to be filled to make society function....but even then, who gets to decide that?  Someone, somewhere.  Even if you had it run through a machine to random pick people, there's no guarantee it isn't rigged and no guarantee they will leave those positions.  Whoever can force them to leave, is then the one with the most power in society......and then they will eventually abuse it.  That's the thing about power in socialism.....somewhere, at some point, it all comes down to the actions/decisions of one person, which is what leads to a dictatorship even if that wasn't the original intent.\n\nThen they turn it into multi generation leaderships that are passed down from father to son.  But that's just one of the fundamental reasons why socialism is doomed to fail on inception.  \n\nTo run a nation, you need people making decisions, and inevitably one person is going to have the most pull, the most power, to make the final decisions.  The pure idea of what they try to paint socialism as, isn't compatible with having a leadership.  True socialism in its purest ideal form would be a leadership-less society....which would make it kind of hard to function properly as a cohesive society because somewhere at some point there will be conflicts or decisions that need to be made, and someone is going to have to arbitrate/adjudicate/implement them, which gives some people power over others, which leads to those people using that power to get more for themselves and thinking that it's their right because of what they 'do for the people'.    \n\nI always think of it like this: Socialism isn't about being as wealthy as your neighbor, it's about being as poor as everyone else.  \n\nSure, the rich are on the top too in capitalist nations, but the difference is you can potentially change your living conditions, and become one of them, and even if you don't you can still end up somewhere in the middle.\n\nWithout competition there isn't incentive for advancement.  After all, it's easy to keep people like N. Koreans busy and distracted by having them toiling in the fields.  We wouldn't have an iphone if it wasn't for capitalism.  The only advancements communism/socialists make is based on the left overs of capitalists.  They only have technology because they got it from us.  And when they do make technology themselves, it's typically derived from the need to keep control over their own people, to increase the resources their people produce to further increase their control and self enrichment, and for attacking outsiders.

"Jesus Christ, what happened to Salon? Look at this:\n\n>What could be a greater indictment of identity politics than the utter hollowing-out of the Democratic Party, its rank electoral defeat at every level of government, which began in earnest with Bill Clinton‚Äôs commitment to neoliberalism in 1991-1992, going hand in hand with identity politics of a kind that had little patience with actual poor people? That period is especially revealing, because Clinton went out of his way, as he would during his entire administration, to celebrate identity politics for the right people, namely, those who are good capitalists, doing everything he could to suggest, by way of policies, that the unreformable poor were no longer welcome in the party.\n\n> The result is the evisceration of the Democrats as a party with even a rhetorical claim to the working class, as it has become a club for egotistical, self-branding urbanites who pay lip service to identity politics while having no sympathy for real wealth redistribution. This loss of even the semblance of a liberal policy framework in the domestic and international arenas continued apace during the Obama administration. Obama was immune to liberal criticism, because he fit the identity politics matrix so perfectly. He may have ruthlessly deported millions of people, kept in place and strengthened the entire extra-constitutional surveillance apparatus, and escalated illegal drone attacks and assassinations, but the color of his skin provided immunity from real criticism.\n\nFrom the second article.

' Twitter fucked up.\n\n They blocked way more than "Russia linked accounts":\n\n> With respect to #DNCLeak, approximately 23,000 users posted around 140,000 unique Tweets with that hashtag in the relevant period. Of those Tweets, **roughly 2% were from potentially Russian-linked accounts.** As noted above, our automated systems at the time detected, labeled, and hid just under half (48%) of all the original Tweets with #DNCLeak. **Of the total Tweets with the hashtag, 0.84% were hidden and also originated from accounts that met at least one of the criteria for a Russian-linked account**\n\n And they over-inflated the number of "Russia linked accounts":\n\n> Because there is no single characteristic that reliably determines geographic origin or affiliation, we relied on a number of criteria, including whether the account was created in Russia, whether the user registered the account with a Russian phone carrier or a Russian email address, whether the user‚Äôs display name contains Cyrillic characters, whether the user frequently Tweets in Russian, and whether the user has logged in from any Russian IP address, even a single time. **We considered an account to be Russian-linked if it had even one of the relevant criteria.**\n\n *This would have included any user from any country using Cyrillic characters. It would have included any user from any country using a free email service with a .ru. It would have included any user in any country that simply writes tweets in the Russian language.*\n'

'I understand that James is excited about the new investigation, but I wonder if his pre-announcement is actually working against his efforts. By pre-announcing his work I suspect that all he is doing is notifying the opposition and giving them caution to prepare at least one diversionary story or tactic to minimize his impact. Maybe he should wait and release his information and catch his Target completely blindsided and unprepared'

"The most effective way to increase the pay for low skilled jobs is to decrease the number of people who are willing to work for less than $15 dollars an hour.  If we build a wall and deport the illegals, we won't even need a minimum wage since employers would have to compete with each other to have people work for them."
"The only tenet of capitalism's is maximizing profit, NOT providing a job for everyone. Remember that! "
'They need to be able to save your order as a code like \nX234 or something simple.\n\nOr on the phone and skip the machine and pre order and pay at once.\n\nThen you walk up hit the code and confirm then pay with phone or card.'
"I guarantee that those kiosks won't mess up your order nor give you an attitude. "
"This proves the theory that low wage low skilled workers are holding back progress. Automation is the wave of the future and redundant, often poorly performing humans are in the way. This why we do not need migrants we need better robotics engineers. \n\nO V E R P O P U L A T I O N is the cause of all of the world's problems."
"I don't like it on a pure esthetics angle.\n\nThere has to be a more appealing looking solution to this.\n\nOtherwise, I honestly don't care.  I use a kiosk at the Sheetz drive up and it works just fine."
'I used those in France and liked them. Much better than ordering from the illegal who barely speaks English in Southern California '
'If you increase minimum wages prices go up. They used to call this inflation. If you double the wage then cost of living doubles. So have you really received a raise?  Fyi in 1992 you could live decently on $10 per hour 1600$ a month rent food and car! $20 would fill up a pickup truck for the entire week minimum wage was then 4-5$ per hour range'
"They did this where I'm from, it resulted in them expanding their kitchen, and they didn't fire anyone, every single employee kept their job."

I've never witnessed anything like it in my life, all the bullshit was gone and we were all on the same page doing what we could to be there for one another. It's the one thing that gives me hope that deep down we are all on the same page.

Because the russians might get into peoples heads through words and memes.

Admire someone for taking responsibility for begin a pedophile? \n\nAt this rate the NYT can also Admire people that take responsibility for killing other people, or raping, or mass murdering.

I saw him on a YT someone linked here (please link again: it\'s like hours long but WELL WORTH IT because it has original footage), and **he look shady AF**. Before JFK even got off the plane, that bitch was boxing up JFK\'s shit basically. *Someone should\'ve done him just for looking so shady and blaming the Italians.*\n\nItalians don\'t forget slights like this.

Marxists, too.)\n\nSame people probably put down Martin Luther King Jr as well. (Note I said KING, not Cream; Martin Luther Cream is a wannabe Sotero son but has too much Swede in him. 100% Swede.

'200k in New York is middle class because of cost of living. (You can barely afford to buy a dinky one bedroom.) 200k in most parts of the country is rich. But a person making 200k in New York would make much less if they moved: different job markets. How can we then fairly define middle class by income? Should be adjusted by cost of living.'
'Shitlibs cannot handle him actually following through on his promises, they have never seen a politician do it '
'Lower taxes for everyone, and stop vilifying the "rich." "Rich" is a subjective, political term. It does not exclusively mean hedge fund managers on Park Avenue. Does a person with a 200k income qualify as "rich"? What if that person is paying off 150k in professional school debt? Not every "rich" person was born into wealth; the significant majority of them go out and earn it. If someone works 12, 14, 16 hours a day for years, doesn\'t he deserve more of his money? In fact, don\'t we all deserve more of our money? Why do we have to justify keeping our own incomes away from the thieving hand of the government?\n\n"Rich" people are not assholes. The government already robs them of far too much money, and for what? More wars and invasions? Health care for every single person who walks into this country? Free college education for any student with a pulse? How altruistic and naive must one become before realizing that you cannot finance your pet projects and bleeding heart fantasies off of the backs of people who work fourteen hours a day? '
'Time for more alternative nostril breathing to calm down.'
'How is cutting taxes to the privledged rich, a gain to the middle and poor classes?'
'As has been mentioned elsewhere in this thread, this debate always hinges on what "rich" means in 2017 America, who\'s defining it, and how.\n\nA true populist (as opposed to a pandering politician) would set it at something like a household AGI of $1M at a minimum. It should arguably be higher than that, but anything less than that is a nonstarter. \n\nAs was also mentioned, strange as it may sound to someone just scraping by on minimum wage in Middle America, there are plenty of areas of the country where a household income of $225K or $275K or $310K certainly don\'t feel very "rich" once you consider property taxes, a mortgage, college funds for your kids, transportation, etc.\n\nSo this conversation starts at 1 million dollars, nothing less. It really isn\'t that complicated, from a political standpoint. '

It is a privilege and if you act like an ungrateful brat, you should lose that privilege. It\'s not like all reporters were banned and things are being kept secret. Trump is the most accessible and transparent of any President in my lifetime by far. Just another phony thing for the media to whine about, but they are all perfectly fine with banning people from social media if they say something they consider wrong.

'Was an opportunity to cash in for sleazy Russian entrepreneurs - selling bullshit tabloid stories on Donald Trump to a cabal-scheming HRC/DNC Democrats and their Obama administration Deep State cohorts.\n\nKind of like the recent punking of Democrat Rep. Schiff where two Russian journalist easily hijink their way into getting direct access to Schiff, recording the conversation, in which Schiff is desperately anxious to get his hands on Trump nudes that they claim they are peddling. (This little vignette is essentially a kind of a microcosm of the entire Russian narrative that has slow drip unwound over the last year.)\n\nIn the case of Schiff, he was motivated by desperation as his *"Muh Russian"* narrative had gone down in flames. Whereas HRC/DNC-Dems, Obama-admin/Deep-State were entirely motivated by a malicious and seditious intent from the get go - first political opposition spying and then that quickly morphing into a conspiracy of coup de\'tat post election.\n\nOf course, as more unravels on the Hillary Clinton collusion with the Russian govt. per the Uranium One scandal, and how Carter Page was a one time FBI asset in 2013 and then FBI flipped and began using him as a patsy so FBI could get a pretext to spy on Trump campaign (and then the Trump administration), it is looking like HRC has been working closely with the Russian govt. all along. So the tabloid trash that Steel put into the FusionGPS dossier really could have been fed in part by his Russian sources that were operating in their intelligence apparatus. Steel certainly never made and effort to meet and verify his sources, nor did the FBI, which took on his info and used it without verification to get FISA warrants.'

"* Manafort accepted money from Yanukovich in 2011 (presumably for helping to engineer the Ukraine election)\n* While working with Podesta\n* Manafort resigned from his role as chairman months into Trump's campaign in 2016--five years later.\n* This links Trump and Russia by....*delusion*.\n\n\nWhat pisses me off about this though is the DNC is *actually* issuing indictments for this goose chase, and what progress have *we* made in draining the swamp? None.\n\nThe dossier, Uranium One, the FBI-restricted servers, Comey and his memos--mountains and mountains of evidence, and not a single indictment."
'As expected, CNBC is playing up the fact that he was Trump‚Äôs former campaign manager (failed to mention the part about money laundering during his time with the Podesta group for Uranium One deal)'

'As a black man I can confirm this, the statues have never been brought up in conversation with anyone I know. Only on social media and the news am I seeing this virtue signaling about it. Also it is mostly millenial blacks that have been indoctrinated by marxists and ghetto blacks who pretty much just read headlines and believe it. Believe it or not most blacks are socially conservative on things like gay marriage and all this gender bullshit. The media and Democrats just influence them because most are not really deep into politics. They just watch the news and catch headlines on social media. I was not even involved until Ron Paul in 2012. Now I am addicted to red pills.'
"BLM didn't even care about the statues. lmao"
"Those statues aren't stupid - they represent the evolution of our nation into what we have today.  Important that we learn from our past."
'The local chapter of the NAACP also said they didn\'t care about the statues.  Only the brainwashed readers of the fake news media have been whipped up into a frenzy to "cleanse" the nation of signs of racism.\n\nThis ethnic cleansing looks so much like ISIS destroying the old temples and statues in the Middle East.  Yep, we sure taught history a lesson by doing that.  \n\nI\'m sure that when all the "racist" statues are gone the ghettos will magically transform into Beverly Hills and new Nikes will appear on everyone\'s feet and an Escalade will be in their garages.

They tend to be socially moderate or conservative, while embracing economic populism. One ex Army male I spoke with was downright nationalist. He was fed up with the situation where people from central and east Asia are promised money and stipends here because the military paid them off for using their land to stage military operations. He was pissed that we give money to people who have no interest in assimilating - yet ignore our own. \n\nIf Republicans can build bridges to socially moderate black males and females, and their churches, we will find good allies.  \n\nBLM isn‚Äôt really aligned with Antifa.

"What I don't understand is why lazy fat entitled illegals should be given amnesty just because they came here at a certain age. They act like they're owed amnesty like we better give it to them and advocate for their criminal parents. They are one in the same they both broke the law and continue by being here unauthorized. Most of these so called dreamers are older than me 25 or 26 they've have 7 or 8 years to get their dang butts over the border and have not done so they've willing broken the law yet we're supposed to treat these adult illegal alien like innocent children when they're guilty of living here illegal as an adult as well. No one should be given amnesty this is why we have this mess at the border and that's the reason I've felt like I can't make a second vote on our president because he never said he was going to give amnesty when he took office. Might as well have Rubio or Cruz in there at least I agree on abortion with them. That's what makes me so disappointed. Because when I actually voted in the general election there were like 2 or 3 reasons I actually decided to vote when waiting for a computer at the library was because this old lady was talking voting and Mexican immigrants reffering to illegals and that enpowered me to vote for him added to the debate on partial birth abortion and Hillary's stance on it and the fact that justice Scalia died and needed a replacement. Now I feel like there's no need or reason to vote in 2020 because he's going to legalize everyone anyhow. And the justice was picked already and Hillary's not going to be president. Even the things I agreed with him he always flips on like the death penalty and prison sentences and then he pardons that drug dealer who should have been left in prison as long as possible. I just don't feel he's what he said he was when he was running where's school choice? I mean also I don't like the stelrategy or credit not given to black Americans who did not vote or voted for him. This was a key factor in Michigan Wisconsin and Ohio especially Michigan the numbers in Detroit were low so the rest of Michigan could turn it red.  Detroit is a black city majority. Yet this is totally ignored. You aggravate that part of the country and it's sure to turn into a blue wall again. I feel like our president tries to cater to Hispanic to get their favor instead of the people that elected him. I feel he prefers the favor from illegal aliens over the people that voted for him the only reason he's here imo is because Americans put him here and in the primaries he claimed he was against amnesty which was a major role in his campaign. I feel like what was the point and why him? There were many Republicans in the primaries that would have allowed amnesty and had the same policies. So I don't get what it was all for. I feel like this next general election I am going to care as much as I cared with Romney v. Obama. I hardly noticed there was an election."

'The MSM sees all non-Whites as allies with their anti-White agenda.\n\nUnfortunately for them a few non-Whites are beginning to realise what living in an America without White people is really going to be like for them.'
'Of course, they do. The whole house of cards \ncould come down, and their fat benefits with it.'
'Liberals wants minority to be ignorant so they can pretend to protect them and virtue signal. Also if minority, LGBT or women disagrees with them they treat them like a traitor. They want to stereotype and generalize those people.'

'Yeah it\'s kinda funny how both liberals and white supremacists don\'t treat minorities equally as whites. Liberals think of minorities as helpless, mindless people who act like their stereotypes and likes SJW garbage. They invent crap like "cultural appropriation" that doesn\'t offend most minorities(they try to brainwash minorities in to thinking that it is offensive though). They try to get minorities to hate majorities to achieve their goal. They are the ones who are truly dividing America and rest of the world with their unfair identity politics. And yes. Real Americans or anyone who believes equality will treat person like a person. Not "black person" or "gay person". \n\nBy the way I\'m not white but I kinda lost my "minority card" by not having liberal opinions haha'
"Not to rain on your parade, but in the actual movie the guy in the glasses is from, he's seeing less clearly through the glasses than he does without them. "
'I\'m pretty sure they have a mental filter that replaces the word "America(n)" with "white(s)".  If you take any of Trump\'s speeches and every time he says "America" you edit the video so it says "white" or some grammatically correct conjugation of it, he would sound like a racist bigot.  If this editing is actually occurring inside of their minds, their behavior makes perfect sense.  If I thought we had elected a President whose campaign slogan was literally "Make whites great again" I would freak out and protest too, anyone would except actual white supremacists.  This also explains why they\'re calling us racists, because they think we\'re hearing the same thing they are when we\'re not because we don\'t have this mental illness.'

'Hey mate something similar has happened in the UK.\n\nI voted Brexit and Brexit won, Trump said before the vote that he wants Brexit to win lol... and the left leaning in crowd are so upset and annoyed.\n\nTo give you some context, 80% of our laws are made in the EU, in the EU parliament the MEPS (members of European Parliament - that the EU countries vote in) can ONLY VOTE on what an unelected european comission puts before them.\n\nEven our conservative prime minister supported remain lol and was shocked when the ppl voted leave.\n\nIt pretty much amounts to a soviet europe. And guess what? Im racist for voting leave now. For wanting to live in a democratic nation and believing the goverment serves us - the ppl and our will, not the other way around.\n\nAnd its racist to think that lol according to the left anyway. '

'Mueller is trying to save his skin. The writing is on the wall though since the U1 docs got dropped.'

'I feel like this probe is going everywhere with no results. Though this looks like it may blow back on Hillary and the Dems!'
'Don‚Äôt fall for this shit. \n\nThese investigation leaks have been 50/50 true/false. \n\nSecondly this is a transparent attempt to keep Mueller around. Don‚Äôt go for it. \n\n**This serves a dual purpose of taking the heat off Mueller currently, as well as giving Poedesta a free pass later on. ‚ÄúSee, they ‚Äòinvestigated‚Äô us and found nothing wrong!!!‚Äù.**'
'Almost certainly not true.  A distraction to make it look like Mueller is not as compromised as he actually is.'
'only so he can exonerate them . Mueller is one of them. '
"That's great but Mueller needs step down/be removed before it becomes Mueller investigating Mueller's connections to Russia.\n"
"Prediction:\nWhen you watch a magician do an illusion, you don't realize that the actual trick is done before the set-up is through.  \n\n\nThis investigation will be open and closed in less time than it took me to read the story, and the Podesta brothers will be found not guilty of any impropriety.\n\n"

"Mueller is not there to investigate, Mueller is there to exonerate. Liberals NEVER face the consequences of what they do. It's just one of the many reasons we HAVE to keep them out of power."
'This to me seems more and more like Mueller was put in place to cover up everything.'
"I don't believe this- not one bit.\nEverything we know tells us the fortunes of the Clinton's-Obama's-Podesta's-Comey-Mueller ALL inextricably linked.\nThis is pure BS- Mueller might claim to go after Podesta's to lock down information and prevent it's release- solidify cover up- provide immunity and absolution\nSame as was done by Comey during the supposed server investigation. He gave immunity to all material witnesses- to silence them- or permit their lies unchallenged- either way\nNOT A CHANCE Mueller truly goes after Podesta's"
"Corruption investigating corruption. Yeah, a whole lot is going to come out of this. It's a shame all of the high profile investigations are done by this one guy. So much trust in him."

One quote: ‚ÄúIf you had a brain at all, you‚Äôd know this is probably a sham since there‚Äôs another memo so why would there be another memo if the first one wasn‚Äôt full of lies?‚Äù\n\nThen they went into how the investigation will go on and how Mueller will present his findings and they should keep it going till November when the results will make the most impact even though the Republican Congress won‚Äôt vote to impeach but Trump is guilty as hell and no phony memo is going to change their mind and if the findings about collusion and obstruction are really bad, it will help Democrats take back Congress.\n\nThe champagne is still in the refrigerator; it‚Äôs getting really cold; they can‚Äôt wait to open the bottle.\n\n(!!!)\n\nIt‚Äôs fascinating. They are determined to die on Muh Russia Hill; the contents of the memo mean nothing to them, because they are so invested in getting rid of the orange jerky jerk face, and they are so dedicated to Hillary, Obama, et al, that I think we could present video evidence of Hillary baking cookies mixed with the baby parts from Planned Parenthood and they‚Äôd still say she should be president because she won the popular vote and Russia hacked the election.\n\nThey‚Äôre acting as if this memo truly means nothing, and thus nothing will change, but if what we‚Äôve read is anything close to the truth, I cannot imagine how Mueller can keep going."

' James Comey, June 8, 2017 testimony:\n\n> The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified.  Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing.\n\n Observe: Comey testified that he saw the dossier as a "salacious and unverified" attempt to discredit the President. Therefore on January 6, 2017 he personally briefed the President on the dossier to defend the incoming President. \n\n October 21, 2016; three months prior to that briefing, the FBI/DOJ FISA warrant application depends on the same dossier in order to get a warrant to spy on Carter Page. This warrant is renewed three times.\n'

But with the number of witness interviews they'll have to conduct and hours of security footage they'll have to review, that's a process that will take a number of weeks.\n\nIf they wanted to engage in a cover-up, you'd have a simple, consistent answers being given. On the other hand early mistakes regarding the facts of the case followed by later corrections is precisely what you would expect to see in a complex, ongoing investigation."

"Here's the part that blows my mind:\n\n>Republican lawmakers have spent the better part of this year investigating whether the dossier, which was funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, served as the basis for the Justice Department and the FBI to obtain FISA surveillance last year on a Trump campaign adviser named Carter Page.\n\nThey've spent a year trying to find out what was on the fisa application??? Is no one in elected government authorised to look at the damn application? Where's the oversight?"

Samson attended high school in Tennessee."  \n\nHe was either 7 or 8 when he came from the Sudan if it was 1999.  He spent at least 18 years here in the U.S., in Tennessee.  '

'That was the original version. It was updated to include "under God" in 1954.'

'That was added back in the day. Under God is not an official pledge.'
"The original pledge if allignece didn't have that line in it. It wasn't added until the 50s."
"For some reason it's picking up the 1923 version. I think it's funny that you call Google commies for listing a prior version of the Pledge of Allegiance. That's the opposite of patriotic."
'Its grabbing from Wiki. Just go in and add "Under God" it is a public website that has public authors. '
'I consider myself a patriot and I\'m torn on this. "Under good" was inserted in 1954. If you\'re a Christian, you\'re probably fine with or without it. It doesn\'t add much, really.'

Not as good as Google, but it doesn\'t have the shitlib bias either.\n\nI believe in Bing. It\'s a good place. They respect important days Goolag does not.'
"Originally the Pledge of Allegiance didn't have Under God. It was added later to distance even more from the communist rise. Google is just pulling one of the several revisions from Wikipedia. The United States wasn't and still isn't a Christian nation. There are plenty of non religious people in the US. "

Closing inequality between black and white can‚Äôt be done by building a wall to keep out people, who in many instances, look like you. Instead, it begins with the very real work of addressing the institutional racism that has been essential to this country long before there was even a border to cross.\n\nThe wall IS key to rebuilding our economic prospects, because ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS undercut American workers, including BLACK workers. So yes, let\'s address the institutional racism coming from the party of segregation, the party that\'s done everything they can to keep us at each other\'s throats, the party that would be very happy to replace Americans with more compliant servants from the Third World.

If bernie wants to take peoples money and give to the less well off why not take it from people who have made their fortunes from the usery of other people.'
'Ah. I remember when all my white friends turned into adults, and went down and got their $116,000 check, and I went down and got my $2,000 check.\n\nBecause that‚Äôs how it works. Not by personal gain and hard work, it‚Äôs just set up like that.\n\n/s'

Not enough Frenchmen? Send in lookalike Spaniards: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7984436.stm\n\n* Footnote: It\'s always curious to me that Americans have a similar colonial set-up and history and understand that Saxons from England aren\'t the same thing as Navajos in the U.S., but are utterly convinced that Spaniards back in Europe are supposed to be Aztecs from Mexico, lol. It\'s like they don\'t understand that (just as with their own history) Spain had the Europeans who sailed to the New World and forced Indians to speak a European language (but are not themselves Indians). One is a European colonizer, the other is the Native colonized. The two are no more related to  each other than a German is related to an Inuit.

No, thanks.\n\nMarsha Blackburn is a political opportunist leeching off of taxpayers. She doesn\'t represent anyone but herself and the political elites in Washington, who undoubtedly tell the dumbass how to vote because she is dense as a box of rocks. She will ride Trump\'s name as long as she can benefit from it and dump him the moment it becomes politically expedient to do so.\n\nI will not be voting for her.

"The US spends far more than that on the military. I did a breakdown a long time ago and I can assure you that the US spends upwards of 1.1 to 1.2 trillion.\n\nFor example, our nuclear arsenal is handled by the [Department of Energy](http://dailycaller.com/2017/01/19/why-does-the-energy-department-control-the-nuclear-arsenal/). This funding isn't counted in military spending but it is clearly military. So we add money to that 685 number. Then there's the collaboration between NASA and the Air Force which isn't free. Then we have unfunded liabilities (disability payments, retirement, pensions, etc...) that is handled by the VA. That adds a couple hundred billion alone, not to mention the cost of the VA itself. That is military spending regardless of how you want to spin it. There are dozens of other items like this you can find. \n\nBack in 2012, I heard Ron Paul state that number and didn't understand where it came from. So I began digging. A few other people did as well so I believe this stuff is available if you want to look for it.\n\nAs much as I love our military, it is an incredibly wasteful organization. Everyone knows the story of how the Army spent Five Billion Dollars ($5,000,000,000) on the camoflage they are now looking to replace because it sucks so badly. This doesn't end at the US Army. "

"He's absolutely correct. Unsubstantiated allegations notwithstanding, there were significant problems with Moore as a candidate. We *cannot* continue running candidates that are caricatures of what leftists think conservatives are. Roy Moore was a backwards thinking, evolution-denying, Bible thumping loon who believes the Constitution is second to his interpretation of Scripture. I am a Christian, but your faith CANNOT be a cornerstone of your campaign and CANNOT be a substitute for an argument.\n\nFurthermore, leftists will continue substituting arguments with allegations that are nearly impossible to prove. They now know they can try this and WIN. The best course of action is to call them out on it, deny it, and throw it back in their faces. They don't care about sexual abuse. That much is clear based on their history. Let's let them know we consider this a war as well, because they sure do."

"We're gonna pay to arm teachers when we already can't supply them properly otherwise? C'mon guys, we're better than this."
"I don't necessarily agree that arming teachers is the solution. If they want to be armed they should be allowed to be, but I think it's a little silly to think that every teacher should be armed. I think hiring private security is the way to go."
'So interesting that the Libs response to school shootings solutions is the same as the response to immigration and DACA..........."No". üòê '
'I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd want my teachers in high school armed.  There was a couple that were real snap-shows.  I liked the armed guards idea, but something about teachers having one just makes me nervous.'
'First Democrats create gun free zones.  Then Democrats shoot up a bunch of people in gun free zones, including Republican Senators.  Now Democrats want your guns.'
"That would be putting an unfair burden onto teachers. They have a right to own a gun sure, but forcing them to carry at school, put themselves in harms way, and take the life of a child? That isn't something they sign up for when they decided to become teachers. We have plenty of qualified police members who took that oath to protect and serve. In the court system we force judges to spend a few years presiding over juvenile or family law cases. I think the same thing could be implemented here where police officers have a probationary period where they work within the school for a year. It could also be a viable option for veterans when they come home. It shouldn't be seen as some lower form of policing either, protecting our nations youth is a job you can be proud of. We don't need to arm teachers we need to arm people who know what they are doing and put them into places where they can save lives. "
'This is one directive I can‚Äôt get behind. There‚Äôs no way arming teachers is the best method for thwarting school shootings.'
"Rather than arm teachers, I'd rather see more security at schools. Make it so a teacher, if they choose, can bring their firearm to the classroom. But not mandatory. "
"That's an effective cartoon "

'This cartoon guy looks just like that student/ child actor '
"Arm teachers with EXTREME vetting. Increase security in schools too. Then let's sort out this FBI incompetency and mental illness epidemic. "

"The solution is to give a kindergarten teacher a 9mm handgun to carry with her in her classroom of walking tornado 5 year olds? C'mon. Get real. That's not a solution."
"That doesn't seem like the solution as over 90% of teachers don't want to be armed. We can't force guns onto people. This solution has been discussed and detected by the people implementing it. I don't think banning guns solves things either though this is a ridiculous suggestion. "

Fortunately, the RNC wasn't built by design to prevent populist uprisings, unlike the superdelegate system the DNC had.

'Please note, the accumulated trade deficits of over 12 Trillion dollars mainly went to China, today our #1 geopolitical and military rival.  Thanks to this influx of cash, they now enjoy the world‚Äôs #2 economy and access to western industrial secrets - whereas before Bush 1, they were backwards and poor and not considered a major threat.\n \nThis is where ‚Äúfree trade‚Äù has taken us.  America once had a central rule - No Trading with Communists.  Leaders spoke of the importance of letting the Chinese dragon sleep.  At the time, most US consumer products were manufactured in America or imported from friendly nations who also stood against communism.  I recall from those times that the American middle class had everything it wanted easily available, and the products were of high quality generally.  We knew that our industrial capabilities provided a fortress for the nation in case of a world war - just as it did in WW2, when the factories quickly converted from producing consumer goods to supporting our soldiers with war materials.\n \nFor the sake of saving a few pennies on consumer items, this is where the globalists have taken America.  A hollow and dying industrial base, the loss of our hard-won intellectual property and manufacturing secrets, and facing a now-wealthy and dangerously empowered rival (who wields trade as just another weapon against us).'

South? Not specified,) China, Ecuador, and Vietnam.** (Interestingly, illegal immigrants from majority-ROP jihad enthusiast nations don\'t make this list.)\n\n\n\n\nAlso interesting: that website lists the top occupations that employed illegal immigrants in 2008. #1 was **Brickmasons, blockmasons, and stonemasons.** \n\n\n\n\nMy personal experience supports this: I recently had work done at my house, and hired a company of guys I know personally. I specified that I wanted no illegal immigrants whatsoever on my property, and certainly none working on this job. Surprise surprise, they subcontracted another local contractor to do the brick/blockwork, who showed up with a dozen non-English-speaking presumably Hispanic "workers" who did a rather shoddy job. They were already half-done by the time I saw this, or I would have sent them packing. Oh well, I will have to content myself with reporting them to ICE.

They specifically say right on the front in red NOT VALID FOR IDENTIFICATION and they also look different.  I've never actually seen one in person - not sure how often they're actually issued, as I have never actually seen one in person.\n\nOP may be confusing this with Chicago, which recently announced they would be issuing a city-wide ID card for anyone - but especially illegals since they can't get any other valid ID.  In this case, it is up to local election boards to decide if they want to take them as ID - and I will bet many precincts will not be allowing them, if any of them do.  I will definitely not be the only one here watching to see if any local election boards are planning to accept them for voter registration.  Additionally, though - this story is about Lake County.  That's not Chicago.  So these are people who were living in the far north suburbs and voting illegally.\n\nThe important point, I think here, is that it can happen anywhere.  This is something that can happen anywhere - it is not unique to Chicago or Illinois.  These are people who flat-out lied during voter registration by attesting that they were eligible to vote.  I guarantee this is not only happening here.  This is happening everywhere people are trying to get away with this.

If less people pay into it it'll get worse, because they pull out when they're healthy then want in when they need it, but at that point they'd be screwed by like a huge premium or something. It should be single payer, the government, with them picking up the cost overruns, which they can just cover with taxes. Revise and repeat."

"There's a pretty simple answer to this one really:\n\nBecause the FBI didn't think Trump would win."
"What's been clear is that the FBI is really more of a counter intel operation rather than a criminal investigative / law enforcement body. Just look at the way they handled the Clinton email probe (1) the didn't know about stone tear (2) they gave immunity for shit information (immunity should be to get somebody to throw target under the bus for successful prosecution) (3) they let targets sit in as counsel for another target (4) they did compel DNC to hand over their servers (5) they relied on conclusions of Crowd Strike etc etc etc."
'> Because the FBI totally NEVER intervenes.\n\nThey would rather hang onto any information they find and try to use it to gain leverage over the president.

According to Comey‚Äôs own words and their actual implication, on January 6, two weeks before Trump‚Äôs inauguration, FBI Director Comey is selected by Obama‚Äôs intelligence chiefs to do a ‚ÄúJ. Edgar Hoover‚Äù on Trump, briefing him on salacious blackmail material fabricated by British intelligence and Clinton campaign operative Christopher Steele. It is a pure Hoover blackmail operation.\n\nComey signals to Trump, ‚Äúgive up your fantasy about cooperation with Russia and we won‚Äôt release this.‚Äù Trump doesn‚Äôt budge. The very next day the whole Steele dossier is leaked all over the international news media, accusing the President-elect of perverse sexual acts with Russian hookers. Comey admitted as much in his testimony June 8, saying **he was aware that that briefing could be construed as a ‚ÄúJ.

As a Cherry on Top he was also charged with perjury because of his testimony about the case.  \n  \nHe stayed on as a Judge  \n  \nIn 1983, he was acquitted by a jury after his alleged co-conspirator, Attorney William Borders, refused to testify in court and went to jail.    \n  \nHe stayed on as a Judge  \n  \nIn 1988, the ***Democrat Controlled*** House of Representatives took up the case, and Hastings was impeached for bribery and perjury by a vote of 413‚Äì3.   \n  \nHe stayed on as a Judge\n  \nIn 1989 he was convicted by the ***Democrat Controlled*** United States Senate - (Robert Byrd D KKK Presiding)  \n  \nHe became the ***the sixth federal judge*** in the history of the United States to be removed from office by the Senate.  \n  \nThe Senate, in two hours of roll calls, voted on 11 of the 17 articles of impeachment and convicted him on 8 of the 11  articles.   \n  \nHe was fired as a Judge - ***BUT*** -   \n  \nThe Senate had the option to ban him from ever holding Federal Office again, they did not do so.  \n  \nRemember his co-conspirator William Borders? he went to jail again for refusing to testify in the impeachment proceedings.  - ***But Wait***  \n  \nHe was later given a full pardon by President Bill Clinton on his last day in office.  \n  \nAs for Hastings  \n  \nIn 1993 the new Florida 23rd District was Created   \n  \nHastings was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1992, representing this new district which has been his (in corruption) ever since.  \n  \n2009 was a good ethical year first he voted to impeach Texas federal judge Samuel B. Kent on all four counts presented.  This was also the year that The Wall Street Journal reported that in 2008 he spent over $24,000 in taxpayer money, meant to pay for office expenses,  to lease a luxury Lexus hybrid sedan.  It was **determined** that this was a legitimate and acceptable use of Taxpayers money.  \n  \nThis guy could be the poster boy for a life of corruption and unethical behavior because in 2012 he was ranked ***First*** in all of the members of the House of Representatives for paying salaries and fees to family members, #1 out of 435 - Stellar Performance,   \n  \nAn independent report in 2012 had this nugget of interest:  \n  \nAlcee Hastings (self):\n\n‚Ä¢ During the 2010 election cycle, Rep. Hastings‚Äô campaign committee reimbursed Rep. Hastings $15,674 for travel and event expenses.   \n\nPatricia Williams (girlfriend):   \n\n‚Ä¢ Ms. Williams is Rep.

"The Chelsea Clinton thing will be interesting going forward, mostly as a barometer for just how out-of-touch the Democrat Party actually is. \n\nAcross America (even among rank-and-file Democrats, I'd imagine), there is ZERO appetite for a Chelsea Clinton candidacy. Absolutely no one is demanding it. No one is looking to Chelsea for leadership or vision on anything of import. I mean, MAYBE if she finds the right state or district, she can get elected to Congress, but as far as her national campaign prospects, Chelsea's would be, much like her mother's campaign, doomed to fail before it ever began, for a whole host of reasons.\n\nSurely top Democrats understand this, just as I'm sure many of them understood it about Hillary. But they weren't strong/brave/powerful enough to convince Hillary she wasn't the national candidate America wanted and found themselves losing to Donald Trump. \n\nBy the time Chelsea decides to run, I wonder if the Democrat Party will have any adults left in it who will squash the Chelsea nonsense before it gets too big. If not, then they're gonna be living deja vu all over again as they pin their hopes to another Clinton who will inevitably go down in flames."

What if the Iran deal was the set up to a nuclear false flag?\n\nNow hear me out.\n\nThe nuclear materials sold to Russia and then to Iran would be indistinguishable from nuclear materials ised in an American made nuclear weapon according to science used to trace nuclear materials to their original source.\n\nTheoretically a nuke given to Israel using nuclear materials from a US source would have the same signature as a nuke made in Iran from nuclear materials from that same source sold to Russia as a go between to Iran.\n\nSo in short, two nukes, same materials, one iran one Israel, no way to tell who set it off. \n\nNow imagine a nuke in the USA going off. They test the material and look it\'s the same as iran (and Israel). We either nuke Tehran or use conventional warfare and who would benefit once the dust settles?

Much money would be spent in inflating certain lies as truth and certain truths as lies and certain conservative journalists as liars and propped up talking heads as honest journalists.

"I agree with you, but one thing . . . they keep toppling ME governments so two countries can ultimately rule the ME.  And the pipeline, if they had gotten rid of Assad, was to destroys Russia's economy.  Which would have caused WWIII, IMHO.  And she promised WWIII to her donors.  If she won, we would have been in a WW, I think.  That is what she still wants and have to look forward to, besides globalism, if they accomplish what they are trying to do now.  Mueller had to be fired.  The people need to know the truth.  The above is a drop in the bucket compared to all their crimes."

'That feeling is understandable, but this is a lonnnnggg game being played.  If you were to go after Hillary right after inauguration, before everything is lined up and all the pieces *and players* are in position, the country would be torn apart.  \n\nWhen you govern a nation, you have to be aware of how much they can bend in your direction before breaking...little by little, you get there.'
'Because that makes her such a better person /s time for you to get deported from here'
'My understanding is if the petro-dollar collapses, which happens if we stop meddling, the US economy collapses. We\'d need a much stronger economy than we have to divest ourselves of the middle east at this point, if that\'s true. It might explain why Trump "plays ball" with the ME. He may not like them, but business is business. You just try to get the best deal, if you\'re forced to deal at all.'

"Do people actually read these political books, or is buying one just just a way to support the author? Truth be told, I bought Been Carson's book (way back before Trump was even running) but only read 1 chapter.  I also bought multiple books by Michael Savage but never finished reading them.

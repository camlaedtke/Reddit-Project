I think he had access to information and he wanted to safeguard the integrity of the investigation, and the integrity of the process, and I probably ought to just leave it right there,” Gowdy replied.  \n\n...\n\n> “Trust me when I tell you this, Martha — I know what it was and I have been a critic of James Comey in the past. But he made the only decision he could have made with respect to appropriating that decision away from the Department of Justice and making the decision himself,” he continued. \n"

The key to a long living nation I seem to find is being as moderate as possible.

"They need to weigh this guys' balls when he dies I can almost guarantee the sheer size of them would be a record he stood up to the most powerful people on the planet and told them they were all trash lmaooo"
"The natural outcome of socialism is that those at the top will always take more than those at the bottom.  They feel they deserve it for 'running' society.  They take all the resources under their control and see soo much, that taking some to enrich themselves, seems like taking crumbs off a giant sandwich; insignificant. And the people are soo powerless to do anything about it anyways, that it doesn't matter.  \n\nIt's funny because when you think about it, they don't even follow socialism truly.  A true socialist nation wouldn't have a leader or people at the top, and would instead have normal people constantly rotating the positions that need to be filled to make society function....but even then, who gets to decide that?  Someone, somewhere.  Even if you had it run through a machine to random pick people, there's no guarantee it isn't rigged and no guarantee they will leave those positions.  Whoever can force them to leave, is then the one with the most power in society......and then they will eventually abuse it.  That's the thing about power in socialism.....somewhere, at some point, it all comes down to the actions/decisions of one person, which is what leads to a dictatorship even if that wasn't the original intent.\n\nThen they turn it into multi generation leaderships that are passed down from father to son.  But that's just one of the fundamental reasons why socialism is doomed to fail on inception.  \n\nTo run a nation, you need people making decisions, and inevitably one person is going to have the most pull, the most power, to make the final decisions.  The pure idea of what they try to paint socialism as, isn't compatible with having a leadership.  True socialism in its purest ideal form would be a leadership-less society....which would make it kind of hard to function properly as a cohesive society because somewhere at some point there will be conflicts or decisions that need to be made, and someone is going to have to arbitrate/adjudicate/implement them, which gives some people power over others, which leads to those people using that power to get more for themselves and thinking that it's their right because of what they 'do for the people'.    \n\nI always think of it like this: Socialism isn't about being as wealthy as your neighbor, it's about being as poor as everyone else.  \n\nSure, the rich are on the top too in capitalist nations, but the difference is you can potentially change your living conditions, and become one of them, and even if you don't you can still end up somewhere in the middle.\n\nWithout competition there isn't incentive for advancement.  After all, it's easy to keep people like N. Koreans busy and distracted by having them toiling in the fields.  We wouldn't have an iphone if it wasn't for capitalism.  The only advancements communism/socialists make is based on the left overs of capitalists.  They only have technology because they got it from us.  And when they do make technology themselves, it's typically derived from the need to keep control over their own people, to increase the resources their people produce to further increase their control and self enrichment, and for attacking outsiders.

"Jesus Christ, what happened to Salon? Look at this:\n\n>What could be a greater indictment of identity politics than the utter hollowing-out of the Democratic Party, its rank electoral defeat at every level of government, which began in earnest with Bill Clinton’s commitment to neoliberalism in 1991-1992, going hand in hand with identity politics of a kind that had little patience with actual poor people? That period is especially revealing, because Clinton went out of his way, as he would during his entire administration, to celebrate identity politics for the right people, namely, those who are good capitalists, doing everything he could to suggest, by way of policies, that the unreformable poor were no longer welcome in the party.\n\n> The result is the evisceration of the Democrats as a party with even a rhetorical claim to the working class, as it has become a club for egotistical, self-branding urbanites who pay lip service to identity politics while having no sympathy for real wealth redistribution. This loss of even the semblance of a liberal policy framework in the domestic and international arenas continued apace during the Obama administration. Obama was immune to liberal criticism, because he fit the identity politics matrix so perfectly. He may have ruthlessly deported millions of people, kept in place and strengthened the entire extra-constitutional surveillance apparatus, and escalated illegal drone attacks and assassinations, but the color of his skin provided immunity from real criticism.\n\nFrom the second article. Seriously read it, it **slaughters** neoliberal elites.\n\nEdit: [I'm archiving this shit just in case, it's too good.](http://archive.is/ZXyr6)"

"Who is saying that the Russian government is behind that. Everybody can hire a Russian marketing company to promote a cause on facebook. It's very likely that Soros or other Clinton donors are behind it to avoid campaign financing laws. From what other countries were ads bought to promote Clinton? This will be very interesting!"
'So sad me and others called this immediately when we saw the headlines about Russia\'s facebook ads but the stories carefully admitted stating the content of those ads. It is like how the media omits the killers race you know it is a minority for sure. If the ads were pro Trump msm wouldn\'t have displayed them all or at least say so, but they had to go with "the ads were divisive" instead of saying yeah they were pro hillary and blm, oops there goes our narrative.\n\nNext MSM will probably try to pull the "Those crafty Russians are so manipulative they knew we would blame them for hacking the election so they made pro-Hillary ads to discredit us and defend themselves before they were caught" yeah ok, and people will believe that conspiracy theory worthy of Infowars.'
'Cuckerberg must find himself in a Catch-22 when he claims the ads did not influence the elections while at the same time selling the benefits of advertising Facebook.\n'
'Thank you, patriot! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸'
"Um.... I actually think that's about right. Kind of like getting behind Nancy Pelosi for POTUS."
'They published so much truth they had to change the title, HAHAHAHA'
"Anyone going to ask why cuckerberg let Russian ads on his website? Oh, he didn't know about them? Hmm that's really strange he does love to censor pages and people that don't fall in line with his own political views.\n\nAgain, so cuckerberg let Russian ads run on his website and only now has told people and share info on it.

'I actually think this is pretty funny.'
'This video isn\'t a "BOMBSHELL".  It just shows adult females who gave their consent to participate in Kimmel\'s, albeit, sleezy bit.  Even though I can\'t stand Kimmel, this video isn\'t a very good example of him sexually abusing women. '
'This isn\'t a bombshell, and he wasn\'t "caught" doing anything.\n\nThis was a skit on his show, and the women were more than willing to play along.\n\nYou could argue he shouldn\'t be such a moralizing douche now, and that he should go back to being funny, given that this behavior doesn\'t exactly paint him as a paragon of virtue but is a bit funny.'
'man I love calling a spade a spade and calling anyone out regardless of political affiliation. The left have been hypocrites for a long time..but let\'s not be disingenuous here...in the video posted he did NOT ask an 18 year old girl to put her mouth on it, they were 2 separate girls...one he asked her age, the other girl he said "why don\'t you put your mouth on it\'.  \n\nDisgusting behavior nonetheless because Jimmy is a hypocrite...though the man show was funny as hell and clearly these women aren\'t being forced to do any of this stuff.  But wanted to point out he did not ask an 18 year old girl to put her mouth on it.'
"Nothing wrong with this.\n\nDon't act like crazy PC liberals "

'It was a set up.  Who owns this tech? Who is profiting from this?'
"The most effective way to increase the pay for low skilled jobs is to decrease the number of people who are willing to work for less than $15 dollars an hour.  If we build a wall and deport the illegals, we won't even need a minimum wage since employers would have to compete with each other to have people work for them."
"The only tenet of capitalism's is maximizing profit, NOT providing a job for everyone. Remember that! "
'They need to be able to save your order as a code like \nX234 or something simple.\n\nOr on the phone and skip the machine and pre order and pay at once.\n\nThen you walk up hit the code and confirm then pay with phone or card.'
"I guarantee that those kiosks won't mess up your order nor give you an attitude. "
"This proves the theory that low wage low skilled workers are holding back progress. Automation is the wave of the future and redundant, often poorly performing humans are in the way. This why we do not need migrants we need better robotics engineers. \n\nO V E R P O P U L A T I O N is the cause of all of the world's problems."
"I don't like it on a pure esthetics angle.\n\nThere has to be a more appealing looking solution to this.\n\nOtherwise, I honestly don't care.  I use a kiosk at the Sheetz drive up and it works just fine."
'I used those in France and liked them. Much better than ordering from the illegal who barely speaks English in Southern California '
'If you increase minimum wages prices go up. They used to call this inflation. If you double the wage then cost of living doubles. So have you really received a raise?  Fyi in 1992 you could live decently on $10 per hour 1600$ a month rent food and car! $20 would fill up a pickup truck for the entire week minimum wage was then 4-5$ per hour range'

Marxists, too.)\n\nSame people probably put down Martin Luther King Jr as well. (Note I said KING, not Cream; Martin Luther Cream is a wannabe Sotero son but has too much Swede in him. 100% Swede.

We eventually found out that there was a "protest" of some sort scheduled. \n\nI\'ll never, ever forget this ... A whopping total of 5 - FIVE - people showed up and each of the camera crews and respective reporters *took turns* bunching those five souls together and have them scream, chant, and wave their signs, etc. Of course, on the local """news""" it was played up as a "big protest" about ... *something*. \n\nThere\'s the world that the likes of leddit and the media would have you see, and then there\'s reality.

But a person making 200k in New York would make much less if they moved: different job markets. How can we then fairly define middle class by income? Should be adjusted by cost of living.'
'Shitlibs cannot handle him actually following through on his promises, they have never seen a politician do it '
'Lower taxes for everyone, and stop vilifying the "rich." "Rich" is a subjective, political term. It does not exclusively mean hedge fund managers on Park Avenue. Does a person with a 200k income qualify as "rich"? What if that person is paying off 150k in professional school debt? Not every "rich" person was born into wealth; the significant majority of them go out and earn it. If someone works 12, 14, 16 hours a day for years, doesn\'t he deserve more of his money? In fact, don\'t we all deserve more of our money? Why do we have to justify keeping our own incomes away from the thieving hand of the government?\n\n"Rich" people are not assholes. The government already robs them of far too much money, and for what? More wars and invasions? Health care for every single person who walks into this country? Free college education for any student with a pulse? How altruistic and naive must one become before realizing that you cannot finance your pet projects and bleeding heart fantasies off of the backs of people who work fourteen hours a day? '
'Time for more alternative nostril breathing to calm down.'
'How is cutting taxes to the privledged rich, a gain to the middle and poor classes?'
'As has been mentioned elsewhere in this thread, this debate always hinges on what "rich" means in 2017 America, who\'s defining it, and how.\n\nA true populist (as opposed to a pandering politician) would set it at something like a household AGI of $1M at a minimum. It should arguably be higher than that, but anything less than that is a nonstarter. \n\nAs was also mentioned, strange as it may sound to someone just scraping by on minimum wage in Middle America, there are plenty of areas of the country where a household income of $225K or $275K or $310K certainly don\'t feel very "rich" once you consider property taxes, a mortgage, college funds for your kids, transportation, etc.\n\nSo this conversation starts at 1 million dollars, nothing less. It really isn\'t that complicated, from a political standpoint. '

The effort in producing my own power would be well worth it, in terms of the health and well-being of my electronics.\n\n\n\n\nThese screeching blue-haired miscreants and their soyboy lapdogs\' primary function in society is consuming resources paid for and developed by others, and helping to rile up the police-car-burning gangbangers.

As in does anyone actually know any real antifa, associate with them, are friends with any? Why are these guys not being interviewed, can anyone even name any of them? These guys are like ghosts.

The whole night was magical in a weird way, sitting there with popcorn and some rootbeer, watching Hillary overtake in Florida, then Donald then Hillary again, then finally Donald. Once CNN started realizing even the 'firewall' states were swinging red, they stopped showing the electoral map at all, and just cut to Van Jones and his infamous 'white lash' comment. \n\nThe next few hours was the liberal panel complaining how butthurt they were, and Pennsylvania stuck at 99% for 7 hours.

'It\'s so disgusting listening to all these so called journalists bashing Trump and the WH for banning one lousy "reporter" from an event. They act like it\'s an attack on the free press when there were plenty of other reporters there. Those that cover the WH don\'t have the right to be there in that capacity. It is a privilege and if you act like an ungrateful brat, you should lose that privilege. It\'s not like all reporters were banned and things are being kept secret. Trump is the most accessible and transparent of any President in my lifetime by far. Just another phony thing for the media to whine about, but they are all perfectly fine with banning people from social media if they say something they consider wrong. I\'d argue it\'s far more important for citizens to be able to express themselves freely online than it is for 1 shitty reporter to have privileged access to the WH. '

"It doesn't stop there President Trump!\n\nNot only did the asking price get bargained down to 1 million but it was to be paid in installments of 100,000... with the delivery of secrets to be made after the first installment.  The agents went to Berlin to drop off the cash.  The Russian took the cash and ran without saying anything.\n\nIn other words this Russian bilked our intelligence services out of $100k in exchange for nothing."
'But we need to increase the budget 20%???????????????????????????'
'Was an opportunity to cash in for sleazy Russian entrepreneurs - selling bullshit tabloid stories on Donald Trump to a cabal-scheming HRC/DNC Democrats and their Obama administration Deep State cohorts.\n\nKind of like the recent punking of Democrat Rep. Schiff where two Russian journalist easily hijink their way into getting direct access to Schiff, recording the conversation, in which Schiff is desperately anxious to get his hands on Trump nudes that they claim they are peddling. (This little vignette is essentially a kind of a microcosm of the entire Russian narrative that has slow drip unwound over the last year.)\n\nIn the case of Schiff, he was motivated by desperation as his *"Muh Russian"* narrative had gone down in flames. Whereas HRC/DNC-Dems, Obama-admin/Deep-State were entirely motivated by a malicious and seditious intent from the get go - first political opposition spying and then that quickly morphing into a conspiracy of coup de\'tat post election.\n\nOf course, as more unravels on the Hillary Clinton collusion with the Russian govt. per the Uranium One scandal, and how Carter Page was a one time FBI asset in 2013 and then FBI flipped and began using him as a patsy so FBI could get a pretext to spy on Trump campaign (and then the Trump administration), it is looking like HRC has been working closely with the Russian govt. all along. So the tabloid trash that Steel put into the FusionGPS dossier really could have been fed in part by his Russian sources that were operating in their intelligence apparatus. Steel certainly never made and effort to meet and verify his sources, nor did the FBI, which took on his info and used it without verification to get FISA warrants.'

Believe it or not most blacks are socially conservative on things like gay marriage and all this gender bullshit.

"Bill Clinton is responsible for the fact NK has nukes and selling out our manufacturing to China and allowing them into WTO, which makes this situation a total clusterfuck, iff China's government is behind this.  \n\nAmazing what can happen in 25 years."

'So, looks like this occurred back in November. \n\nAnyone know whether it was state owned or private Chinese held corps involved in the trading?\n\nIn the event they were private companies, any action taken by the Chinese in response to this?'

"Loretta Lynch more than likely. The informant wanted to talk back in 2016, so I assume that's when NDA was written, to keep from talking about Uranium One during election. Or it could've been put in place earlier by Holder. Either way Obama definitely ordered it to be covered up."

'The two best things Republicans could do now is 1) undo the alienation of the black vote, or at least black males, and 2) drop voodoo economics and pursue economic nationalist and populist economics. Economic nationalism was what Trump initially ran on and that sort of “take care of our own” populism had some crossover appeal with Bernie voters. \n\nIn my recent conversations with American black males,  two things stick out. They tend to be socially moderate or conservative, while embracing economic populism. One ex Army male I spoke with was downright nationalist. He was fed up with the situation where people from central and east Asia are promised money and stipends here because the military paid them off for using their land to stage military operations. He was pissed that we give money to people who have no interest in assimilating - yet ignore our own. \n\nIf Republicans can build bridges to socially moderate black males and females, and their churches, we will find good allies.  \n\nBLM isn’t really aligned with Antifa. BLM just thinks they have common opposition. \n'

"What I don't understand is why lazy fat entitled illegals should be given amnesty just because they came here at a certain age. They act like they're owed amnesty like we better give it to them and advocate for their criminal parents. They are one in the same they both broke the law and continue by being here unauthorized. Most of these so called dreamers are older than me 25 or 26 they've have 7 or 8 years to get their dang butts over the border and have not done so they've willing broken the law yet we're supposed to treat these adult illegal alien like innocent children when they're guilty of living here illegal as an adult as well. No one should be given amnesty this is why we have this mess at the border and that's the reason I've felt like I can't make a second vote on our president because he never said he was going to give amnesty when he took office. Might as well have Rubio or Cruz in there at least I agree on abortion with them. That's what makes me so disappointed. Because when I actually voted in the general election there were like 2 or 3 reasons I actually decided to vote when waiting for a computer at the library was because this old lady was talking voting and Mexican immigrants reffering to illegals and that enpowered me to vote for him added to the debate on partial birth abortion and Hillary's stance on it and the fact that justice Scalia died and needed a replacement. Now I feel like there's no need or reason to vote in 2020 because he's going to legalize everyone anyhow. And the justice was picked already and Hillary's not going to be president. Even the things I agreed with him he always flips on like the death penalty and prison sentences and then he pardons that drug dealer who should have been left in prison as long as possible. I just don't feel he's what he said he was when he was running where's school choice? I mean also I don't like the stelrategy or credit not given to black Americans who did not vote or voted for him. This was a key factor in Michigan Wisconsin and Ohio especially Michigan the numbers in Detroit were low so the rest of Michigan could turn it red.  Detroit is a black city majority. Yet this is totally ignored. You aggravate that part of the country and it's sure to turn into a blue wall again. I feel like our president tries to cater to Hispanic to get their favor instead of the people that elected him. I feel he prefers the favor from illegal aliens over the people that voted for him the only reason he's here imo is because Americans put him here and in the primaries he claimed he was against amnesty which was a major role in his campaign. I feel like what was the point and why him? There were many Republicans in the primaries that would have allowed amnesty and had the same policies. So I don't get what it was all for. I feel like this next general election I am going to care as much as I cared with Romney v. Obama. I hardly noticed there was an election."

'It’s worth pointing out that Germany shut down their nuclear power plants after Fukushima. This didn’t help their energy independence with respect to the Russians. They also drank deeply of the Green Energy Kool-Aid. You can’t run a modern technological civilization on wind and solar, period, full stop.\n\nThey’ve really badly screwed themselves on energy policy, to go along with their self-screwing on immigration policy. And Trump just very publicly rubbed their noses in it! \n\nThis is something that just can’t be ignored in the context of NATO discussions, and boy oh boy, our GEOTUS really gave that anthill a big kick.'

They would have a problem with growing EU skepticism which you can see in countries like Italy and in part Greece. \n\nThey have to push the idea the EU is such a brilliant place.\n\nA "Trump like" leader within the EU would bring it all down.

'Support our troops. Bring them home.'
"This is great.  It shows Trump's knack for finding positions the silent majority of people will support, and where opponents will really harm themselves by opposing.\n\nOpponents will protest, moan, demean the Armed Forces and generally expose themselves as being against the military in principle. This will be very obvious when people call the parade fascist or say having pride in military service is only for Nazis.\n\nMeanwhile, most Americans (huge majority) will say thank you to those people in uniform and appreciate the parade."

Chuck Schumer met my mother who told him I worked for him. He lied straight to her face about how valuable I am and how much I mean to his staff. I picked up the phone in an office of 2 people and a set of interns and listened to constituents gripe about various issues they cared about.

ICE is a necessary bogeyman, but much like the gumball immigration speech, they aren't really part of the solution.  It has to be tackled at the policy level.  The welfare system needs to be eliminated entirely or completely restricted to citizens, businesses who employ illegals need to be penalized, birthright citizenship ended, and voter ID introduced and enforced."

'What is truly worrisome is when the entire notion of supporting Western Civilization is deemed racist and misogynistic... the saving grace is that these are all just trendy philosophies, they have no lasting power... in a decade they will all have new haircuts.  No one is truly willing to give up the wonders of our contemporary society, it’s all just a put-on, some kind of social signaling gone awry.  \nBut for some, they would rather all of us be stripped of our rights and privileges, so that we can all be naked and shivering under a highway overpass... they can’t see that it our duty to extend these rights and privileges to all of mankind, and to elevate everyone... this is a long, and arduous task, one that has been going on literally for millennia, but they are too impatient... they are a people obsessed with immediate feedback, with a “like” or a “share” within seconds of their inane utterances...'

"Proud American reporting in. My family came from Chile to the USA because we saw it as the land of opportunity. And it was, but only because my parents worked their asses off, and me and my brother concentrated on doing well in school. My family believes that hard work pays off, and this country is the place that let that happen. No other place I'd rather be, pedes."

"Too many lurkers!! 50k views. Lurkers don't forget to upvote all posts In here. Gotta BTHO Reddit! "
'Yeah it\'s kinda funny how both liberals and white supremacists don\'t treat minorities equally as whites. Liberals think of minorities as helpless, mindless people who act like their stereotypes and likes SJW garbage. They invent crap like "cultural appropriation" that doesn\'t offend most minorities(they try to brainwash minorities in to thinking that it is offensive though). They try to get minorities to hate majorities to achieve their goal. They are the ones who are truly dividing America and rest of the world with their unfair identity politics. And yes. Real Americans or anyone who believes equality will treat person like a person. Not "black person" or "gay person". \n\nBy the way I\'m not white but I kinda lost my "minority card" by not having liberal opinions haha'
"Not to rain on your parade, but in the actual movie the guy in the glasses is from, he's seeing less clearly through the glasses than he does without them. "
'I\'m pretty sure they have a mental filter that replaces the word "America(n)" with "white(s)".  If you take any of Trump\'s speeches and every time he says "America" you edit the video so it says "white" or some grammatically correct conjugation of it, he would sound like a racist bigot.  If this editing is actually occurring inside of their minds, their behavior makes perfect sense.  If I thought we had elected a President whose campaign slogan was literally "Make whites great again" I would freak out and protest too, anyone would except actual white supremacists.  This also explains why they\'re calling us racists, because they think we\'re hearing the same thing they are when we\'re not because we don\'t have this mental illness.'

'Meanwhile natives who are 1/16th and are actually white will still be considered in the crew if they agree with all the right things. '
'Hey mate something similar has happened in the UK.\n\nI voted Brexit and Brexit won, Trump said before the vote that he wants Brexit to win lol... and the left leaning in crowd are so upset and annoyed.\n\nTo give you some context, 80% of our laws are made in the EU, in the EU parliament the MEPS (members of European Parliament - that the EU countries vote in) can ONLY VOTE on what an unelected european comission puts before them.\n\nEven our conservative prime minister supported remain lol and was shocked when the ppl voted leave.\n\nIt pretty much amounts to a soviet europe. And guess what? Im racist for voting leave now. For wanting to live in a democratic nation and believing the goverment serves us - the ppl and our will, not the other way around.\n\nAnd its racist to think that lol according to the left anyway. '

"This sub always has me laughing, we have the most spicy memes don't we folks?"
"Let's remember, gang. Hillary went on Colbert and said how she doesn't feel this is how the POTUS should act.

"Pretty sure the speech is in his first language, so no barrier there. The content quite possibly the most succinct   recap of everything he has been talking about for the last 2 or more years. One day you'll get it and we'll have a coat ready for you after you disavow. "
'Mueller is trying to save his skin. The writing is on the wall though since the U1 docs got dropped.'

'I feel like this probe is going everywhere with no results. Though this looks like it may blow back on Hillary and the Dems!'
'Don’t fall for this shit. \n\nThese investigation leaks have been 50/50 true/false. \n\nSecondly this is a transparent attempt to keep Mueller around. Don’t go for it. \n\n**This serves a dual purpose of taking the heat off Mueller currently, as well as giving Poedesta a free pass later on. “See, they ‘investigated’ us and found nothing wrong!!!”.**'
'Almost certainly not true.  A distraction to make it look like Mueller is not as compromised as he actually is.'
'only so he can exonerate them . Mueller is one of them. '
"That's great but Mueller needs step down/be removed before it becomes Mueller investigating Mueller's connections to Russia.\n"
"Prediction:\nWhen you watch a magician do an illusion, you don't realize that the actual trick is done before the set-up is through.  \n\n\nThis investigation will be open and closed in less time than it took me to read the story, and the Podesta brothers will be found not guilty of any impropriety.\n\n"
'You know what\'s hilarious? EE in the UK blocks that archive link on a prepaid SIM. How\'s that for "nothing to see here"?'

'Oh yeah.  Meuller is going to get to the bottom of the Podesta items.  Hold your breath.'
"Mueller is not there to investigate, Mueller is there to exonerate. Liberals NEVER face the consequences of what they do. It's just one of the many reasons we HAVE to keep them out of power."
'This to me seems more and more like Mueller was put in place to cover up everything.'
"I don't believe this- not one bit.\nEverything we know tells us the fortunes of the Clinton's-Obama's-Podesta's-Comey-Mueller ALL inextricably linked.\nThis is pure BS- Mueller might claim to go after Podesta's to lock down information and prevent it's release- solidify cover up- provide immunity and absolution\nSame as was done by Comey during the supposed server investigation. He gave immunity to all material witnesses- to silence them- or permit their lies unchallenged- either way\nNOT A CHANCE Mueller truly goes after Podesta's"
"Corruption investigating corruption. Yeah, a whole lot is going to come out of this. It's a shame all of the high profile investigations are done by this one guy. So much trust in him."
"Funny didn't hear about this much anywhere "

"The other shoe has yet to drop.  The foreign troll army was put in place to help Hillary in the primaries, and all of her 'pied piper' candidates in the GOP.  The activity in the indictment glosses over what those 80 people in St Petersburg were really doing for $1.25 million PER MONTH.\n\nThe tiny amount of money they spent on Facebook ads and promoting Trump events in Florida is purely a cover story for the focus of their work."
"Russians didn't like the sanctions imposed by OBama over Crimea Annexation in early 2014.  Russians wanted to encourage Trump over HRC.   Russians liked Trump and Trump and Tillerson liked Russians.  After the election, Trump was more or less forced to go along with sanctions against Russia because if he didn't it would look like he was their puppet.  Thats whats going on."

"You should explain why you are transferring out of the class.  It's a University, so you are going to have to provide an argument, not just 'he sucks' or 'liberal bullshit'.  Explain that the professor is not using facts or sources.  Explain that the professor is targeting one demographic group, while omitting other demographic groups and the human rights violations they have inflicted.  Explain how the class is differing from its original stated objectives.  Identify something the professor said that was untrue, then disprove it.  With sources.  That should give your argument some weight.\n\nThen send your explanation to the professor and the University.  1-2 pages.  There are tons of websites that let people rate their professors.  Post it on every one.  Put them all on notice: the free ride is over.  Indoctrination will not be suffered without repercussions.  Write it well."

'Looks like we are going to get 4 pages full of black squares. '
'In the end it might be best to simply let the 5 days run out.  From what I understand if President Trump does not object it automatically will be released after 5 days.  That would avoid the whole explosive issue being pinned on him and blunt any claims of obstruction in the Muller "investigation".'

Wouldn't it be interesting if that group/person were called to testify at congress, or at the IG's probe?\n\nComey and Strzok  have committed treason/sedition/conspiracy against the people of the United States. They should be dealt with to the full extent of the law. Perhaps a deal for them to be truthful and to give the whole story. Might I suggest life imprisonment instead of firing squad?"
'Here is the key question:\n\nWhat blackmail dirt did they have on Comey that they were able to force him to accept these edits??\nIn other words, if he was originally willing to basically incriminate Clinton, how could he allow it to be twisted like this into a forced exoneration letter?

The reason for the massive increase this year is because the Obama Federal Subsidies expired, but the insurance companies still have to subsidize those who qualify.  So they Jack up the price on those who aren't subsidized to cover those who are. "

"My liberal co-workers are furious. I mean the butt-hurt level left 11 behind and is now rising to 25. I haven't seen them this furious since November 9th, 2016.\n\nThey are angry and raising their voices. They are talking over each other. It’s hilarious. It’s like they’re drowning and clinging to each other to not drown and aren’t aware that they’ll only end up drowning as a group.\n\nSummary: The memo is fake! There’s still a chance for impeachment because the Republicans won’t allow the release of the Democrat memo which is the real memo that says the Nunes memo is wrong so all we have is a fake memo and that means Hillary still has a chance to win. One quote: “If you had a brain at all, you’d know this is probably a sham since there’s another memo so why would there be another memo if the first one wasn’t full of lies?”\n\nThen they went into how the investigation will go on and how Mueller will present his findings and they should keep it going till November when the results will make the most impact even though the Republican Congress won’t vote to impeach but Trump is guilty as hell and no phony memo is going to change their mind and if the findings about collusion and obstruction are really bad, it will help Democrats take back Congress.\n\nThe champagne is still in the refrigerator; it’s getting really cold; they can’t wait to open the bottle.\n\n(!!!)\n\nIt’s fascinating. They are determined to die on Muh Russia Hill; the contents of the memo mean nothing to them, because they are so invested in getting rid of the orange jerky jerk face, and they are so dedicated to Hillary, Obama, et al, that I think we could present video evidence of Hillary baking cookies mixed with the baby parts from Planned Parenthood and they’d still say she should be president because she won the popular vote and Russia hacked the election.\n\nThey’re acting as if this memo truly means nothing, and thus nothing will change, but if what we’ve read is anything close to the truth, I cannot imagine how Mueller can keep going."
'I think what we all learned today is to never, ever, under any circumstances ever talk to or contact the FBI about anything ever again.  \nTerrorist plot?  Grab a firearm and handle it yourself.  \nThe FBI can no longer be trusted for anything.  \nThanks, Obama.  '
'I’m absolutely amazed at how nothing about this memo is on the front page or /all/. But surprised? No. It’s fucking reddit censoring as usual. '
'It’s time for final preperarions folks. The 2nd amendment exists for this purpose. When the liberals try to break the law and remove President Trump, we all must stand up and defend him with every means possible and available to us as citizens.\n\nWe are ready up here in New Hampshire.'

'Dems would impeach regardless of legal precedent.  You can take that to the bank !'
'And despite all that, if they dems get enough seats, they’ll still successfully impeach trump for no reason.\n\nFucking traitors, the lot of them.'
"Another juicy tidbit that's not being mentioned enough.  The total number of FISA applications since the start of the secret court, the total number of FISA warrants issued, the percentage of successful FISA applications, and the fact that the initial FISA application against the Trump campaign was denied.  It's astonishing.  See for yourself."

'So they used the FISA on Page as the thin end of a wedge to spy on the whole Trump team. And the FISA was obtained by hiding the bias, effectively by spinning a story to the court and saying "Trust us"'
"Hopefully Trump's team of lawyers is all over this."
' James Comey, June 8, 2017 testimony:\n\n> The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified.  Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing.\n\n Observe: Comey testified that he saw the dossier as a "salacious and unverified" attempt to discredit the President. Therefore on January 6, 2017 he personally briefed the President on the dossier to defend the incoming President. \n\n October 21, 2016; three months prior to that briefing, the FBI/DOJ FISA warrant application depends on the same dossier in order to get a warrant to spy on Carter Page. This warrant is renewed three times.\n'

The MSM loves to blur the lines between anchors, reporters and editorialists.  I agree with /u/BitsoupLol, infra.  This administration was elected.  CNN was not.  CNN is not without rights.  CNN can listen, take notes, and then report.  There is no right to argue with the White House during a press conference.  This was totally inappropriate.'

This was crowded at mid-day and her husband/SO was with her.  I didn’t see it happen because the gang surrounded her and then scattered- it happened very, very fast. Her screams lasted long after they ran away like roaches.  \n\nLater, our taxi driver acknowledged attacks may occasionally happen but best not to dwell... lovely day in Paris, after all! \n\nWe travel far and frequently.

"Of course the simplest answer is that the media, both left and right, have largely quit covering it because there's no credible political angle and therefore nothing for talking heads to screech at each other about and no points to be scored or agendas to be advanced.\n\nIf, after a reasonable period of time, they can't put together a coherent timeline then you've got to question the competence of the investigation. But with the number of witness interviews they'll have to conduct and hours of security footage they'll have to review, that's a process that will take a number of weeks.\n\nIf they wanted to engage in a cover-up, you'd have a simple, consistent answers being given. On the other hand early mistakes regarding the facts of the case followed by later corrections is precisely what you would expect to see in a complex, ongoing investigation."

Instead, it begins with the very real work of addressing the institutional racism that has been essential to this country long before there was even a border to cross.\n\nThe wall IS key to rebuilding our economic prospects, because ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS undercut American workers, including BLACK workers.

'Rasmussen doesn\'t include the "No Opinion", so when they have 50% approval they also have 50% disapproval. With the other polls, they include the no opinions, and then the media reports mainly on the approval rating without mentioning disapproval. So, for instance, under Gallup, Trump could have a 42% approval but his disapproval might only be 42% as well if 8% have no opinion. You have to watch out for that.'
"I think Trump's rating will increase more and more as more people realized that they got so many benefits from the tax cut.\n\nLots of people are foaming at mouth to hate Trump, but secretly these people do like him, because for most people, money is king. A president that increases income of people, using any methods, is a president that will be voted again and again. \n\nYou will get no money if you just march for life or do some Soros-sponsored marches.

Liberals think entirely with their emotions and art is a way of making emotions tangible. Without a successful entertainment industry, liberal logic will die out because they’ll have to start relying on actual logic if they want to convince anyone of anything.'

'Interesting how those numbers are [a total lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_in_the_United_States_by_household_income#By_race), and that Asian households have a median income nearly twice that of white households.\n\nAlmost like there\'s a racial motivation here, but surely that can\'t be...\n\nEDIT:  Noticed that Crazy Bernie\'s numbers are "wealth," not "income," but I have no idea if the former\'s ever been reliably recorded.'

If bernie wants to take peoples money and give to the less well off why not take it from people who have made their fortunes from the usery of other people.'
'Ah. I remember when all my white friends turned into adults, and went down and got their $116,000 check, and I went down and got my $2,000 check.\n\nBecause that’s how it works. Not by personal gain and hard work, it’s just set up like that.\n\n/s'

"The last time I even saw a dicks was... 10 years ago? I went in once and didn't by anything because they're really overpriced. I mean usually sporting goods stores have a mark up (Academy) But wow dicks really ran with it. So I guess I'll continue to never shop there lol. "
'Who cares? Stop reacting to the liberal traps, and they\'ll have nothing to talk about. As of right now, the CNN headlines read something like: "Trump supporters outraged at DICKS"\n\nJust ignore it. It isn\'t worth the effort. '
'Real talk though.  Dicks has never really had any decent firearms for an ok price (at least in New England).  It will be funny to watch them lose some revenue.'
'Need a lawyerpede here to help, but if the legal age is 18 I think they should be compelled to sell or else pull all remaining rifles from their stores.\n\nWhy would this be any different than the cake controversy? It’s a constitutional right that you can buy a rifle at 18, correct?'
'I recommend a name change from DICK\'s to "PU$$Y\'s"'
"Funny, you're old enough to vote, to fuck, to join the military and fire the shit out of an M16... but DICK's wants to treat you with kid gloves until you're 21?"

"I'm actually okay with this. If a private company wants to limit who they sell to, then more power to them. Same as a bakery if they wish not to bake cakes for someone for a particular reason."
"Yes, makes sense.  You sell firearms, yet are alienating customers who want to purchase firearms in an effort to attract customers who despise firearms.  Stick to selling overpriced cross country shoes.  Frankly, I'm surprised you still exist - who shops there anyway?  "
'To be fair, There’s nothing wrong with this, hasn’t trump wanted to raise the legal gun Age?, anyways, I need my soccer stuff from there.'
'Not a problem.  Everything they sell is way overpriced.'
"Let's be honest does anyone really shop there for guns?"

'Because they wanted Hillary to win and they rigged absolutely everything against Trump'
"Obama,  MSM & friends all thought they rigged the election enough for Hillary that they didn't give a shit about no russian collusion until it bit them in the ass."
"He's got a point.\n\nObama told them to step down, then went around telling everyone the election couldn't be rigged.\n\nIf there was an American who colluded with the Russians to fix the election for Trump, it looks like it was Barack Obama."
'How does anyone know that the Russian military hacked the DNC or Hilary if they never had access to the server? His name was Seth Rich. '
"Because they never thought she'd lose the (rigged) election"
'The cyber security team responsible for protecting America’s infrastructure was told to “ stand down” by team obama so they’d have incidents to frame trump for Russia collusion. This was their plan all along. '
'By allowing the crimes to be committed they had an insurance policy in case Trump won.\n\n'

'Keep Tweeting this info out Mr. President. Our truth detector.'
'🤔..... good question.'
"because charging 12 russians  who will be disappeared by  the next day and never see a day in court isn't really going to accomplish anything unless you are just putting on a show and Obama didn't want anyone to be able to question the results when the sure thing hillary took office. "

'I hope Trump shoves this in the faces of every single person that criticized him for saying he was wire tapped. I hope he mentions it every god damn day for the next 8 years. '
"It's almost like Trump was right about Trump Tower being wiretapped and his campaign being spied on... \n\n\u2003\u2003 \n\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to add that Manafort at the time was Trump's campaign chairman. Every private conversations between Trump and Manafort were wiretapped. That's essentially the same as wiretapping Trump.  And the fact that we are only just learning about Manafort now means there's probably more Trump associates living in Trump tower who were all wiretapped similarly by the Obama administration. "
'there is some fuckery afoot. I saw that CNN was reporting this, they only report the truth when they have to cover up a bigger lie. Wonder what that bigger lie is? '
'So, I was privy to many of those conversations. Nothing bad of course... Mainly delegate situation. '
'Ya, but did obama himself personally enter trump tower and physically do the wiretapping on campaign staff or trump lines? Mental gymnastics keep reaching new levels. '
'There seriously needs to be a special prosecutor.\n\nPaging jeff sessions.... '
'Seems like mueller zeroing in on manafort to justify his existence '
'Trump was right all along. Can we not stop winning?'
'Liberals and deep state aficionados will try to point out that there was some kind of "probable cause" to justify a warrant for these wiretaps.

'Obviously, Donna likes being alive. \n\nIt appears to me that her book is a very elaborate way to “I am not, nor have I ever been suicidal. I do not have any issues with my heart or its function. If anything happens to me, investigate.” \n\nSome folks do this on Twitter. She, on the other hand, did this. '
'By pushing the Seth Rich narrative, Brazile will be able to claim all the bad stuff she did was "under duress" as she feared for her life.\n\nWhether she believes or knows about Seth Rich is irrelevant, she\'s trying to protect her ass.'
"She's been 'whistling' Seth Rich on at least four occasions that I've counted.  I don't know how more obvious you could get.  \n\nIF it came out that it was Seth as the leak, and not Russian Phishers (not the same as hacking as the press says it was) it would change everything.... EVERYTHING!"

'She is trying to tie Seth Rich to the Russians.\n\nMaybe Seth was sent by Putin to collect their bribe money from the clintons.'
"I'm just curious as to whether Seth's parents have received any lump sums in the past year."

Send in lookalike Spaniards: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7984436.stm\n\n* Footnote: It\'s always curious to me that Americans have a similar colonial set-up and history and understand that Saxons from England aren\'t the same thing as Navajos in the U.S., but are utterly convinced that Spaniards back in Europe are supposed to be Aztecs from Mexico, lol. It\'s like they don\'t understand that (just as with their own history) Spain had the Europeans who sailed to the New World and forced Indians to speak a European language (but are not themselves Indians).

No, thanks.\n\nMarsha Blackburn is a political opportunist leeching off of taxpayers. She doesn\'t represent anyone but herself and the political elites in Washington, who undoubtedly tell the dumbass how to vote because she is dense as a box of rocks. She will ride Trump\'s name as long as she can benefit from it and dump him the moment it becomes politically expedient to do so.\n\nI will not be voting for her.

"The US spends far more than that on the military. I did a breakdown a long time ago and I can assure you that the US spends upwards of 1.1 to 1.2 trillion.\n\nFor example, our nuclear arsenal is handled by the [Department of Energy](http://dailycaller.com/2017/01/19/why-does-the-energy-department-control-the-nuclear-arsenal/). This funding isn't counted in military spending but it is clearly military. So we add money to that 685 number. Then there's the collaboration between NASA and the Air Force which isn't free. Then we have unfunded liabilities (disability payments, retirement, pensions, etc...) that is handled by the VA. That adds a couple hundred billion alone, not to mention the cost of the VA itself. That is military spending regardless of how you want to spin it. There are dozens of other items like this you can find. \n\nBack in 2012, I heard Ron Paul state that number and didn't understand where it came from. So I began digging. A few other people did as well so I believe this stuff is available if you want to look for it.\n\nAs much as I love our military, it is an incredibly wasteful organization. Everyone knows the story of how the Army spent Five Billion Dollars ($5,000,000,000) on the camoflage they are now looking to replace because it sucks so badly. This doesn't end at the US Army. "

"He's absolutely correct. Unsubstantiated allegations notwithstanding, there were significant problems with Moore as a candidate. We *cannot* continue running candidates that are caricatures of what leftists think conservatives are. Roy Moore was a backwards thinking, evolution-denying, Bible thumping loon who believes the Constitution is second to his interpretation of Scripture. I am a Christian, but your faith CANNOT be a cornerstone of your campaign and CANNOT be a substitute for an argument.\n\nFurthermore, leftists will continue substituting arguments with allegations that are nearly impossible to prove. They now know they can try this and WIN. The best course of action is to call them out on it, deny it, and throw it back in their faces. They don't care about sexual abuse. That much is clear based on their history. Let's let them know we consider this a war as well, because they sure do."

He won\'t throw white Southerners who love their heritage under the bus, just to cave in to the leftist fake media and score PC points. \n\nHe was exactly right to bring up Washington and Jefferson, and the fact that eventually that\'s who the leftists will target, since they were slave owners. They will try to eradicate the legacy of our founders. No other politician would dare to touch that subject.\n\nThe "alt-left" are indeed extremely violent totalitarians who hate this country and want to erase its history.

However, there are no direct testimonies that the business deal had any political implications. \n\nEdit: So it's actually a Canadian company, not an American one?\n\n> The article, in January 2013, detailed how the Russian atomic energy agency, Rosatom, had taken over a Canadian company with uranium-mining stakes stretching from Central Asia to the American West. The deal made Rosatom one of the world’s largest uranium producers and brought Mr. Putin closer to his goal of controlling much of the global uranium supply chain.\n\n> But the untold story behind that story is one that involves not just the Russian president, but also a former American president and a woman who would like to be the next one.

"We're gonna pay to arm teachers when we already can't supply them properly otherwise? C'mon guys, we're better than this."
"I don't necessarily agree that arming teachers is the solution. If they want to be armed they should be allowed to be, but I think it's a little silly to think that every teacher should be armed. I think hiring private security is the way to go."
'So interesting that the Libs response to school shootings solutions is the same as the response to immigration and DACA..........."No". 😐 '

'First Democrats create gun free zones.  Then Democrats shoot up a bunch of people in gun free zones, including Republican Senators.  Now Democrats want your guns.'
"That would be putting an unfair burden onto teachers. They have a right to own a gun sure, but forcing them to carry at school, put themselves in harms way, and take the life of a child? That isn't something they sign up for when they decided to become teachers. We have plenty of qualified police members who took that oath to protect and serve. In the court system we force judges to spend a few years presiding over juvenile or family law cases. I think the same thing could be implemented here where police officers have a probationary period where they work within the school for a year. It could also be a viable option for veterans when they come home. It shouldn't be seen as some lower form of policing either, protecting our nations youth is a job you can be proud of. We don't need to arm teachers we need to arm people who know what they are doing and put them into places where they can save lives. "
'This is one directive I can’t get behind. There’s no way arming teachers is the best method for thwarting school shootings.'

"The solution is to give a kindergarten teacher a 9mm handgun to carry with her in her classroom of walking tornado 5 year olds? C'mon. Get real. That's not a solution."
"That doesn't seem like the solution as over 90% of teachers don't want to be armed. We can't force guns onto people. This solution has been discussed and detected by the people implementing it. I don't think banning guns solves things either though this is a ridiculous suggestion. "

"Gf's dad just said he wouldn't attend another game if any of our team's players kneel. Season ticket holder since the late 70s and huge Trump supporter. He currently has 8 club seats as a season ticket holder. \n\nEdit: Confirmed. He's out. Giving seats away to military members and spending the cash on toys for their kids. If no action is taken, he won't renew. "
"They are all doubling down - either kneeling as a group or not even coming out for the Anthem. Time to break out a book and head to the beach after church today.  Not even going to a sports bar for lunch.  As a former HS and College player and coach for 10 years it's hard but better than the alternative "
'Ravens fan here but glad they got their asses kicked today. Not buying any tickets this season or memorabilia until they get their heads on straight. When did the NFL lose its focus on football? '
'Just play the fucking game!           \nretards.'

'If the NFL sinks in popularity, this weekend will be the point where it began'
"So let me get this straight:  A group of people who because they are football players, got to coast through high school, with their coaches and admin who  threaten teachers to pass them so they can play regardless of their grades.   A group of people who went to college for free, while millions of others have to struggle, work and get into debt to afford college.  A group of people who make millions of dollars playing a fucking game.  A group of people who commit crimes way above the national average and get a slap on the wrist for each crime.\n\nThese are the people who are going to disrespect our flag, our anthem, our military.  These privileged fucking babies are going to lecture US on 'institutional racism'.  People who coast through life without working an honest day in their life.  Give me a fucking break.  "

'Far left will start supporting NFL to protest Trump. Go ANTIFA Redskins'

'I can\'t be the only one who thinks Crappernick\'s body language here is screaming "I really wish I hadn\'t opened ~~Pandora\'s~~ Obama\'s box now." He looks so done.\n\nToo bad, buddy. You could have played your sportball, collected your $126 million, actually used some of it to bring legitimate benefit to people in need and been known as a good person. Instead you virtue signaled to a fan base consisting mostly of hard workers who consider your sportball a three-hour vacation from the hardships of life and therefore didn\'t want it politicized under any circumstances.\n\nAnd no, being paid millions of dollars has nothing to do with being or not being allowed to speak your mind, so any cucks coming with that line of defense can fuck right off. The sportball field was Crappernick\'s "workplace" (I use that term loosely since these grown ass men are being paid millions to play a highly refined version of a schoolyard game). If you politicize the workplace, you deal with consequences, whether you\'re a construction laborer (fired) or a CEO (hit in the pocketbook by consumers who are tired of your shit and decide to go elsewhere). If you want to be active behind the scenes, good, go do that, that\'s your business. But keep your product and your politics separate. It\'s not rocket science.'
"So let me get this straight. You get paid millions of dollars, get to live in a mansion, drive cars that cost more than most people... and you don't think it's appropriate to stand in support of the country where all of these things were made possible?"
'A little chess being played also....Hillary was grabbing headlines..even if they were idiotic. How to make her irrelevant and put her on the small print of the back page...POTUS Trump did it in 2 tweets on a sure fire popular theme.He took her spotlight away again.No one is talking about her now. Thank You POTUS Trump'

"Sotero getting excited to see so many young bucks down on a knee, it's usually barry who is the swallower......"

"Yeah I don't understand this whole kneeling thing you are paid incredibly well to play football nobody wants politics added to the game it's just stupid they are just creating more issues for people to fight over and get distracted from actual problems if you want to be a asshole who doesn't want to stand and thinks kneeling is some magnificent form of protest do it on your own time not while the fans are lining your pockets "

It's about time we had a POTUS that has an actual backbone. One that stands by his ideals and fights for the American people instead of kissing the ass of every ally and pandering to the pc squad.\n\nAfter years of having chihuahuas for presidents it's about damn time we let a pitbull handle things. Thank you Mr. President you have finally given me some hope for the people running this country."
"The funny thing is that Bernie and Trump are very similar on their trade stance and how it is hurting the US worker.

'Please note, the accumulated trade deficits of over 12 Trillion dollars mainly went to China, today our #1 geopolitical and military rival.  Thanks to this influx of cash, they now enjoy the world’s #2 economy and access to western industrial secrets - whereas before Bush 1, they were backwards and poor and not considered a major threat.\n \nThis is where “free trade” has taken us.  America once had a central rule - No Trading with Communists.  Leaders spoke of the importance of letting the Chinese dragon sleep.  At the time, most US consumer products were manufactured in America or imported from friendly nations who also stood against communism.  I recall from those times that the American middle class had everything it wanted easily available, and the products were of high quality generally.  We knew that our industrial capabilities provided a fortress for the nation in case of a world war - just as it did in WW2, when the factories quickly converted from producing consumer goods to supporting our soldiers with war materials.\n \nFor the sake of saving a few pennies on consumer items, this is where the globalists have taken America.  A hollow and dying industrial base, the loss of our hard-won intellectual property and manufacturing secrets, and facing a now-wealthy and dangerously empowered rival (who wields trade as just another weapon against us).'

South? Not specified,) China, Ecuador, and Vietnam.** (Interestingly, illegal immigrants from majority-ROP jihad enthusiast nations don\'t make this list.)\n\n\n\n\nAlso interesting: that website lists the top occupations that employed illegal immigrants in 2008. #1 was **Brickmasons, blockmasons, and stonemasons.** \n\n\n\n\nMy personal experience supports this: I recently had work done at my house, and hired a company of guys I know personally. I specified that I wanted no illegal immigrants whatsoever on my property, and certainly none working on this job. Surprise surprise, they subcontracted another local contractor to do the brick/blockwork, who showed up with a dozen non-English-speaking presumably Hispanic "workers" who did a rather shoddy job. They were already half-done by the time I saw this, or I would have sent them packing. Oh well, I will have to content myself with reporting them to ICE.

"IL pede here.\n\nIllegals don't get drivers licenses in IL.  We have TVDL's - Temporary Visitor Driver's Licenses.  They specifically say right on the front in red NOT VALID FOR IDENTIFICATION and they also look different.  I've never actually seen one in person - not sure how often they're actually issued, as I have never actually seen one in person.\n\nOP may be confusing this with Chicago, which recently announced they would be issuing a city-wide ID card for anyone - but especially illegals since they can't get any other valid ID.  In this case, it is up to local election boards to decide if they want to take them as ID - and I will bet many precincts will not be allowing them, if any of them do.  I will definitely not be the only one here watching to see if any local election boards are planning to accept them for voter registration.  Additionally, though - this story is about Lake County.  That's not Chicago.  So these are people who were living in the far north suburbs and voting illegally.\n\nThe important point, I think here, is that it can happen anywhere.  This is something that can happen anywhere - it is not unique to Chicago or Illinois.  These are people who flat-out lied during voter registration by attesting that they were eligible to vote.  I guarantee this is not only happening here.  This is happening everywhere people are trying to get away with this.

If less people pay into it it'll get worse, because they pull out when they're healthy then want in when they need it, but at that point they'd be screwed by like a huge premium or something.

'Trust me, POTUS knew Manafort was implicates in these deals with or without the FBI letting him know. But by including Manafort in his campaign, he drew attention to Manafort’s connection to the Clinton’s and will be able to implicate them in Russian collusion. '
"There's a pretty simple answer to this one really:\n\nBecause the FBI didn't think Trump would win."
"What's been clear is that the FBI is really more of a counter intel operation rather than a criminal investigative / law enforcement body. Just look at the way they handled the Clinton email probe (1) the didn't know about stone tear (2) they gave immunity for shit information (immunity should be to get somebody to throw target under the bus for successful prosecution) (3) they let targets sit in as counsel for another target (4) they did compel DNC to hand over their servers (5) they relied on conclusions of Crowd Strike etc etc etc."
'> Because the FBI totally NEVER intervenes.\n\nThey would rather hang onto any information they find and try to use it to gain leverage over the president. They tried to do this with the [Steele dossier](https://larouchepub.com/other/editorials/2017/4424_lar_stop_fbi_fraud_coup.html):\n\n"Here’s how the actual conspiracy worked in general outline. According to Comey’s own words and their actual implication, on January 6, two weeks before Trump’s inauguration, FBI Director Comey is selected by Obama’s intelligence chiefs to do a “J. Edgar Hoover” on Trump, briefing him on salacious blackmail material fabricated by British intelligence and Clinton campaign operative Christopher Steele. It is a pure Hoover blackmail operation.\n\nComey signals to Trump, “give up your fantasy about cooperation with Russia and we won’t release this.” Trump doesn’t budge. The very next day the whole Steele dossier is leaked all over the international news media, accusing the President-elect of perverse sexual acts with Russian hookers. Comey admitted as much in his testimony June 8, saying **he was aware that that briefing could be construed as a “J. Edgar Hoover moment,**” in response to a question from Senator Susan Collins of Maine."'

If the democrats here suddenly had a incredibly high budget, and a likable candidate, of course the margin will shrink.

'This guy is a real example of character & integrity (NOT) - A little bedtime History story:  \n\nThe slime story starts in 1977 probably before Spez and 90+% of the people on here were born.  \n  \nHe was appointed as a Federal Judge in Florida by President Carter.  \n  \nIn 1981 he was charged with accepting a $150,000 bribe in the  racketeering case against Frank and Thomas Romano this bribe was in exchange for a light sentence and the return of their seized assets.  As a Cherry on Top he was also charged with perjury because of his testimony about the case.  \n  \nHe stayed on as a Judge  \n  \nIn 1983, he was acquitted by a jury after his alleged co-conspirator, Attorney William Borders, refused to testify in court and went to jail.    \n  \nHe stayed on as a Judge  \n  \nIn 1988, the ***Democrat Controlled*** House of Representatives took up the case, and Hastings was impeached for bribery and perjury by a vote of 413–3.   \n  \nHe stayed on as a Judge\n  \nIn 1989 he was convicted by the ***Democrat Controlled*** United States Senate - (Robert Byrd D KKK Presiding)  \n  \nHe became the ***the sixth federal judge*** in the history of the United States to be removed from office by the Senate.  \n  \nThe Senate, in two hours of roll calls, voted on 11 of the 17 articles of impeachment and convicted him on 8 of the 11  articles.   \n  \nHe was fired as a Judge - ***BUT*** -   \n  \nThe Senate had the option to ban him from ever holding Federal Office again, they did not do so.  \n  \nRemember his co-conspirator William Borders? he went to jail again for refusing to testify in the impeachment proceedings.  - ***But Wait***  \n  \nHe was later given a full pardon by President Bill Clinton on his last day in office.  \n  \nAs for Hastings  \n  \nIn 1993 the new Florida 23rd District was Created   \n  \nHastings was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1992, representing this new district which has been his (in corruption) ever since.  \n  \n2009 was a good ethical year first he voted to impeach Texas federal judge Samuel B. Kent on all four counts presented.  This was also the year that The Wall Street Journal reported that in 2008 he spent over $24,000 in taxpayer money, meant to pay for office expenses,  to lease a luxury Lexus hybrid sedan.  It was **determined** that this was a legitimate and acceptable use of Taxpayers money.  \n  \nThis guy could be the poster boy for a life of corruption and unethical behavior because in 2012 he was ranked ***First*** in all of the members of the House of Representatives for paying salaries and fees to family members, #1 out of 435 - Stellar Performance,   \n  \nAn independent report in 2012 had this nugget of interest:  \n  \nAlcee Hastings (self):\n\n• During the 2010 election cycle, Rep. Hastings’ campaign committee reimbursed Rep. Hastings $15,674 for travel and event expenses.   \n\nPatricia Williams (girlfriend):   \n\n• Ms. Williams is Rep. Hastings’ deputy district director. 6 Between 2007 and 2010, Rep. Hastings’ congressional office paid Ms. Williams $622,574. 7 Her most recent annual salary was $166,000. 8 In addition, Rep. Hastings owes Ms. Williams, a lawyer, between $500,001 and $1,000,000 for defending him during an impeachment trial. \n  \n\n\n  \n'
">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcee_Hastings#Judicial_career_(1977–1989)\n\nThat's quite impressive to be honest. Think about the balls and lack of shame it takes to do all of that.\n\n>Alleged co-conspirator attorney William Borders went to jail again for refusing to testify in the impeachment proceedings, but was later given a full pardon by President Bill Clinton on his last day in office\n\nJesus Christ. And this guy is *still* serving."

"The Chelsea Clinton thing will be interesting going forward, mostly as a barometer for just how out-of-touch the Democrat Party actually is. \n\nAcross America (even among rank-and-file Democrats, I'd imagine), there is ZERO appetite for a Chelsea Clinton candidacy. Absolutely no one is demanding it. No one is looking to Chelsea for leadership or vision on anything of import. I mean, MAYBE if she finds the right state or district, she can get elected to Congress, but as far as her national campaign prospects, Chelsea's would be, much like her mother's campaign, doomed to fail before it ever began, for a whole host of reasons.\n\nSurely top Democrats understand this, just as I'm sure many of them understood it about Hillary. But they weren't strong/brave/powerful enough to convince Hillary she wasn't the national candidate America wanted and found themselves losing to Donald Trump. \n\nBy the time Chelsea decides to run, I wonder if the Democrat Party will have any adults left in it who will squash the Chelsea nonsense before it gets too big. If not, then they're gonna be living deja vu all over again as they pin their hopes to another Clinton who will inevitably go down in flames."

So the only way to make American car competitive in China is give them technology to make components and build a factory in China and help China grow GDP. God, commies are smart. "

They test the material and look it\'s the same as iran (and Israel). We either nuke Tehran or use conventional warfare and who would benefit once the dust settles?

'So if the date passes and we get Supreme Court to overturn they’d all immediately be going right?'
'They’re focused right now on milking the deaths of schoolchildren'

I think he had access to information and he wanted to safeguard the integrity of the investigation, and the integrity of the process, and I probably ought to just leave it right there,” Gowdy replied.  \n\n...\n\n> “Trust me when I tell you this, Martha — I know what it was and I have been a critic of James Comey in the past. But he made the only decision he could have made with respect to appropriating that decision away from the Department of Justice and making the decision himself,” he continued. \n"

The key to a long living nation I seem to find is being as moderate as possible. Any country that went too far leftist like the USSR or too right-wing like Nazi Germany or Mussolini\'s Italy, never last long. This is why America is still here over 200+ years while all those extreme countries couldn\'t last more than decades. '
"They need to weigh this guys' balls when he dies I can almost guarantee the sheer size of them would be a record he stood up to the most powerful people on the planet and told them they were all trash lmaooo"
"The natural outcome of socialism is that those at the top will always take more than those at the bottom.  They feel they deserve it for 'running' society.  They take all the resources under their control and see soo much, that taking some to enrich themselves, seems like taking crumbs off a giant sandwich; insignificant. And the people are soo powerless to do anything about it anyways, that it doesn't matter.  \n\nIt's funny because when you think about it, they don't even follow socialism truly.  A true socialist nation wouldn't have a leader or people at the top, and would instead have normal people constantly rotating the positions that need to be filled to make society function....but even then, who gets to decide that?  Someone, somewhere.  Even if you had it run through a machine to random pick people, there's no guarantee it isn't rigged and no guarantee they will leave those positions.  Whoever can force them to leave, is then the one with the most power in society......and then they will eventually abuse it.  That's the thing about power in socialism.....somewhere, at some point, it all comes down to the actions/decisions of one person, which is what leads to a dictatorship even if that wasn't the original intent.\n\nThen they turn it into multi generation leaderships that are passed down from father to son.  But that's just one of the fundamental reasons why socialism is doomed to fail on inception.  \n\nTo run a nation, you need people making decisions, and inevitably one person is going to have the most pull, the most power, to make the final decisions.  The pure idea of what they try to paint socialism as, isn't compatible with having a leadership.  True socialism in its purest ideal form would be a leadership-less society....which would make it kind of hard to function properly as a cohesive society because somewhere at some point there will be conflicts or decisions that need to be made, and someone is going to have to arbitrate/adjudicate/implement them, which gives some people power over others, which leads to those people using that power to get more for themselves and thinking that it's their right because of what they 'do for the people'.    \n\nI always think of it like this: Socialism isn't about being as wealthy as your neighbor, it's about being as poor as everyone else.  \n\nSure, the rich are on the top too in capitalist nations, but the difference is you can potentially change your living conditions, and become one of them, and even if you don't you can still end up somewhere in the middle.\n\nWithout competition there isn't incentive for advancement.  After all, it's easy to keep people like N. Koreans busy and distracted by having them toiling in the fields.  We wouldn't have an iphone if it wasn't for capitalism.  The only advancements communism/socialists make is based on the left overs of capitalists.  They only have technology because they got it from us.  And when they do make technology themselves, it's typically derived from the need to keep control over their own people, to increase the resources their people produce to further increase their control and self enrichment, and for attacking outsiders.

"Jesus Christ, what happened to Salon? Look at this:\n\n>What could be a greater indictment of identity politics than the utter hollowing-out of the Democratic Party, its rank electoral defeat at every level of government, which began in earnest with Bill Clinton’s commitment to neoliberalism in 1991-1992, going hand in hand with identity politics of a kind that had little patience with actual poor people? That period is especially revealing, because Clinton went out of his way, as he would during his entire administration, to celebrate identity politics for the right people, namely, those who are good capitalists, doing everything he could to suggest, by way of policies, that the unreformable poor were no longer welcome in the party.\n\n> The result is the evisceration of the Democrats as a party with even a rhetorical claim to the working class, as it has become a club for egotistical, self-branding urbanites who pay lip service to identity politics while having no sympathy for real wealth redistribution. This loss of even the semblance of a liberal policy framework in the domestic and international arenas continued apace during the Obama administration. Obama was immune to liberal criticism, because he fit the identity politics matrix so perfectly. He may have ruthlessly deported millions of people, kept in place and strengthened the entire extra-constitutional surveillance apparatus, and escalated illegal drone attacks and assassinations, but the color of his skin provided immunity from real criticism.\n\nFrom the second article. Seriously read it, it **slaughters** neoliberal elites.\n\nEdit: [I'm archiving this shit just in case, it's too good.](http://archive.is/ZXyr6)"

It would have included any user from any country using a free email service with a .ru. It would have included any user in any country that simply writes tweets in the Russian language.*\n'

'So sad me and others called this immediately when we saw the headlines about Russia\'s facebook ads but the stories carefully admitted stating the content of those ads. It is like how the media omits the killers race you know it is a minority for sure. If the ads were pro Trump msm wouldn\'t have displayed them all or at least say so, but they had to go with "the ads were divisive" instead of saying yeah they were pro hillary and blm, oops there goes our narrative.\n\nNext MSM will probably try to pull the "Those crafty Russians are so manipulative they knew we would blame them for hacking the election so they made pro-Hillary ads to discredit us and defend themselves before they were caught" yeah ok, and people will believe that conspiracy theory worthy of Infowars.'

'man I love calling a spade a spade and calling anyone out regardless of political affiliation. The left have been hypocrites for a long time..but let\'s not be disingenuous here...in the video posted he did NOT ask an 18 year old girl to put her mouth on it, they were 2 separate girls...one he asked her age, the other girl he said "why don\'t you put your mouth on it\'.  \n\nDisgusting behavior nonetheless because Jimmy is a hypocrite...though the man show was funny as hell and clearly these women aren\'t being forced to do any of this stuff.

'It was a set up.  Who owns this tech? Who is profiting from this?'
"The most effective way to increase the pay for low skilled jobs is to decrease the number of people who are willing to work for less than $15 dollars an hour.  If we build a wall and deport the illegals, we won't even need a minimum wage since employers would have to compete with each other to have people work for them."
"The only tenet of capitalism's is maximizing profit, NOT providing a job for everyone. Remember that! "
'They need to be able to save your order as a code like \nX234 or something simple.\n\nOr on the phone and skip the machine and pre order and pay at once.\n\nThen you walk up hit the code and confirm then pay with phone or card.'
"I guarantee that those kiosks won't mess up your order nor give you an attitude. "
"This proves the theory that low wage low skilled workers are holding back progress. Automation is the wave of the future and redundant, often poorly performing humans are in the way. This why we do not need migrants we need better robotics engineers. \n\nO V E R P O P U L A T I O N is the cause of all of the world's problems."
"I don't like it on a pure esthetics angle.\n\nThere has to be a more appealing looking solution to this.\n\nOtherwise, I honestly don't care.  I use a kiosk at the Sheetz drive up and it works just fine."
'I used those in France and liked them. Much better than ordering from the illegal who barely speaks English in Southern California '
'If you increase minimum wages prices go up. They used to call this inflation. If you double the wage then cost of living doubles. So have you really received a raise?  Fyi in 1992 you could live decently on $10 per hour 1600$ a month rent food and car! $20 would fill up a pickup truck for the entire week minimum wage was then 4-5$ per hour range'

My parents, hell my **grandparents** (RIP RIP RIP RIP) and all their friends and my Godparents, they **all** say on good authority that LBJ was in on that hit and tried to blame Italians for it, when it was really (whatever spooks call their capos). ( <--- "spooks" just means spies, btw, not Brits or anything rayciss. Though they DO tend to be white guys, don\'t they? Marxists, too.)\n\nSame people probably put down Martin Luther King Jr as well. (Note I said KING, not Cream; Martin Luther Cream is a wannabe Sotero son but has too much Swede in him. 100% Swede. I hear you gotta wear shades around White Lightning or he can damage your eyes he so bright white.) But who did those 60s people blame? That\'s right: **the Italians.** Romans. HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE people (really Sicilians btw).\n\nWe\'ve got to make sure **JFK\'s legacy of GREATNESS** lives on though CIA spooks and Hitlary want to put the kibosh on JFK.'

'Shitlibs cannot handle him actually following through on his promises, they have never seen a politician do it '

Does a person with a 200k income qualify as "rich"? What if that person is paying off 150k in professional school debt? Not every "rich" person was born into wealth; the significant majority of them go out and earn it. If someone works 12, 14, 16 hours a day for years, doesn\'t he deserve more of his money? In fact, don\'t we all deserve more of our money? Why do we have to justify keeping our own incomes away from the thieving hand of the government?\n\n"Rich" people are not assholes. The government already robs them of far too much money, and for what? More wars and invasions? Health care for every single person who walks into this country? Free college education for any student with a pulse? How altruistic and naive must one become before realizing that you cannot finance your pet projects and bleeding heart fantasies off of the backs of people who work fourteen hours a day? '

It should arguably be higher than that, but anything less than that is a nonstarter. \n\nAs was also mentioned, strange as it may sound to someone just scraping by on minimum wage in Middle America, there are plenty of areas of the country where a household income of $225K or $275K or $310K certainly don\'t feel very "rich" once you consider property taxes, a mortgage, college funds for your kids, transportation, etc.\n\nSo this conversation starts at 1 million dollars, nothing less.

Corporate political correctness and "ethics" is no different, they just have a greater discretion in firing you for disagreeing than a college would.\n\nIn theory, this is what private companies should be able to do, since free market etc., you have freedom of expression, not obliging others not to react to it, but how do you reconcile those principles with the fact that the company culture has now become extremely discriminatory and totalitarian? It wasn\'t supposed to be this way.'

'To be fair it\'s not counting one ideology as more toxic than the other, in the online surveys they did, those against Trump were counted as toxic as well.\n\nIn fact it just seems that having an opinion means you are toxic, regardless if you are on the left or right.\n\nAs for certain words being more toxic than others, they probably have sets of data that people marked as toxic, and if your word is part of a lot of toxic as opposed to non toxic sentences, it will be marked high as toxic.\n\nWhich is why muslim is 4% and muslims is 68%.\n\nThe API does have its purposes, as Wikipedia uses it, since you want neutral reporting.

'But in 50 years it will actually be republicans because of party switches.'
"We need to start infiltrating Antifa and recording them. It should be fairly simple. They don't plan well and they're filled with delusions. Just wear all black, put on some spying camera glasses (or a hidden GoPro), and inject ourselves into their group rallies. They won't notice because they're all dressed the same. Might capture a lot of interesting dialog. Maybe even find out who is helping them organize."
"Three hundred and ten. Trump won New Hampshire.\n\n(A weird formatting issue wouldn't let me write 310.)"
"The best place to watch the meltdown was CNN, right in the enemy's bunker. They'd invested so much in this nifty demographics technology to let you know precisely which districts had voted which way in the past and were trying to be 'unbiased' because they all thought Hillary would win.\n\n It was fun watching them pressing all those little screens as the results became painfully clear that the swing states were swinging right into DJT's open arms. The whole night was magical in a weird way, sitting there with popcorn and some rootbeer, watching Hillary overtake in Florida, then Donald then Hillary again, then finally Donald. Once CNN started realizing even the 'firewall' states were swinging red, they stopped showing the electoral map at all, and just cut to Van Jones and his infamous 'white lash' comment. \n\nThe next few hours was the liberal panel complaining how butthurt they were, and Pennsylvania stuck at 99% for 7 hours. "
'They stole Nevada. I know he won Nevada. '
'Thank you PA.'
'So looking at this map technically a Democratic candidate only really need 186 electoral votes to win, since they get Cali and NY by default.\n\nAnd yet even with all that Trump still won.'

'I like that he always uses "We" in his Tweets. That\'s right Mr. President, us. And we\'re 110% behind you.'
'>The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election!\n\nI’m afraid I’m going to have to disagree with this.  I believe the issue goes deeper than politics.  Trump’s use of twitter threatens the press in a way they’ve never seen.  He doesn’t need them to speak to the people.  He doesn’t have to kiss their ring to ensure his message is delivered.  He is proving that the mainstream media are as obsolete as the daily paper.  \n\nAnd that’s what drives them crazy.\n\n'

"As a black man (just to point out I'm not anti minority) but I hate this current agenda by politicians and media to shove the idea that diversity is somehow intrinsically good. You cannot fail if you simply diversify.\n\nWhat I don't get is why it's western countries that have to diversify. I for one think country = culture. You can bring a bit with you but if you plan to move to another country you really need to become part of that culture.\n\nNone of this, move first demand cultural changes after."

'It\'s so disgusting listening to all these so called journalists bashing Trump and the WH for banning one lousy "reporter" from an event. They act like it\'s an attack on the free press when there were plenty of other reporters there. Those that cover the WH don\'t have the right to be there in that capacity. It is a privilege and if you act like an ungrateful brat, you should lose that privilege. It\'s not like all reporters were banned and things are being kept secret. Trump is the most accessible and transparent of any President in my lifetime by far. Just another phony thing for the media to whine about, but they are all perfectly fine with banning people from social media if they say something they consider wrong. I\'d argue it\'s far more important for citizens to be able to express themselves freely online than it is for 1 shitty reporter to have privileged access to the WH. '

(This little vignette is essentially a kind of a microcosm of the entire Russian narrative that has slow drip unwound over the last year.)\n\nIn the case of Schiff, he was motivated by desperation as his *"Muh Russian"* narrative had gone down in flames. Whereas HRC/DNC-Dems, Obama-admin/Deep-State were entirely motivated by a malicious and seditious intent from the get go - first political opposition spying and then that quickly morphing into a conspiracy of coup de\'tat post election.\n\nOf course, as more unravels on the Hillary Clinton collusion with the Russian govt. per the Uranium One scandal, and how Carter Page was a one time FBI asset in 2013 and then FBI flipped and began using him as a patsy so FBI could get a pretext to spy on Trump campaign (and then the Trump administration), it is looking like HRC has been working closely with the Russian govt. all along. So the tabloid trash that Steel put into the FusionGPS dossier really could have been fed in part by his Russian sources that were operating in their intelligence apparatus. Steel certainly never made and effort to meet and verify his sources, nor did the FBI, which took on his info and used it without verification to get FISA warrants.'

Believe it or not most blacks are socially conservative on things like gay marriage and all this gender bullshit. The media and Democrats just influence them because most are not really deep into politics. They just watch the news and catch headlines on social media.

'The two best things Republicans could do now is 1) undo the alienation of the black vote, or at least black males, and 2) drop voodoo economics and pursue economic nationalist and populist economics. Economic nationalism was what Trump initially ran on and that sort of “take care of our own” populism had some crossover appeal with Bernie voters. \n\nIn my recent conversations with American black males,  two things stick out. They tend to be socially moderate or conservative, while embracing economic populism. One ex Army male I spoke with was downright nationalist. He was fed up with the situation where people from central and east Asia are promised money and stipends here because the military paid them off for using their land to stage military operations. He was pissed that we give money to people who have no interest in assimilating - yet ignore our own. \n\nIf Republicans can build bridges to socially moderate black males and females, and their churches, we will find good allies.  \n\nBLM isn’t really aligned with Antifa. BLM just thinks they have common opposition. \n'

"What I don't understand is why lazy fat entitled illegals should be given amnesty just because they came here at a certain age. They act like they're owed amnesty like we better give it to them and advocate for their criminal parents. They are one in the same they both broke the law and continue by being here unauthorized. Most of these so called dreamers are older than me 25 or 26 they've have 7 or 8 years to get their dang butts over the border and have not done so they've willing broken the law yet we're supposed to treat these adult illegal alien like innocent children when they're guilty of living here illegal as an adult as well. No one should be given amnesty this is why we have this mess at the border and that's the reason I've felt like I can't make a second vote on our president because he never said he was going to give amnesty when he took office. Might as well have Rubio or Cruz in there at least I agree on abortion with them. That's what makes me so disappointed. Because when I actually voted in the general election there were like 2 or 3 reasons I actually decided to vote when waiting for a computer at the library was because this old lady was talking voting and Mexican immigrants reffering to illegals and that enpowered me to vote for him added to the debate on partial birth abortion and Hillary's stance on it and the fact that justice Scalia died and needed a replacement. Now I feel like there's no need or reason to vote in 2020 because he's going to legalize everyone anyhow. And the justice was picked already and Hillary's not going to be president. Even the things I agreed with him he always flips on like the death penalty and prison sentences and then he pardons that drug dealer who should have been left in prison as long as possible. I just don't feel he's what he said he was when he was running where's school choice? I mean also I don't like the stelrategy or credit not given to black Americans who did not vote or voted for him. This was a key factor in Michigan Wisconsin and Ohio especially Michigan the numbers in Detroit were low so the rest of Michigan could turn it red.  Detroit is a black city majority. Yet this is totally ignored. You aggravate that part of the country and it's sure to turn into a blue wall again. I feel like our president tries to cater to Hispanic to get their favor instead of the people that elected him. I feel he prefers the favor from illegal aliens over the people that voted for him the only reason he's here imo is because Americans put him here and in the primaries he claimed he was against amnesty which was a major role in his campaign. I feel like what was the point and why him? There were many Republicans in the primaries that would have allowed amnesty and had the same policies. So I don't get what it was all for. I feel like this next general election I am going to care as much as I cared with Romney v. Obama. I hardly noticed there was an election."

Liberals think of minorities as helpless, mindless people who act like their stereotypes and likes SJW garbage. They invent crap like "cultural appropriation" that doesn\'t offend most minorities(they try to brainwash minorities in to thinking that it is offensive though). They try to get minorities to hate majorities to achieve their goal. They are the ones who are truly dividing America and rest of the world with their unfair identity politics. And yes. Real Americans or anyone who believes equality will treat person like a person. Not "black person" or "gay person". \n\nBy the way I\'m not white but I kinda lost my "minority card" by not having liberal opinions haha'

'I\'m pretty sure they have a mental filter that replaces the word "America(n)" with "white(s)".  If you take any of Trump\'s speeches and every time he says "America" you edit the video so it says "white" or some grammatically correct conjugation of it, he would sound like a racist bigot.  If this editing is actually occurring inside of their minds, their behavior makes perfect sense.  If I thought we had elected a President whose campaign slogan was literally "Make whites great again" I would freak out and protest too, anyone would except actual white supremacists.  This also explains why they\'re calling us racists, because they think we\'re hearing the same thing they are when we\'re not because we don\'t have this mental illness.'

'Don’t fall for this shit. \n\nThese investigation leaks have been 50/50 true/false. \n\nSecondly this is a transparent attempt to keep Mueller around. Don’t go for it. \n\n**This serves a dual purpose of taking the heat off Mueller currently, as well as giving Poedesta a free pass later on. “See, they ‘investigated’ us and found nothing wrong!!!”.**'
'Almost certainly not true.  A distraction to make it look like Mueller is not as compromised as he actually is.'
'only so he can exonerate them . Mueller is one of them. '
"That's great but Mueller needs step down/be removed before it becomes Mueller investigating Mueller's connections to Russia.\n"

"Mueller is not there to investigate, Mueller is there to exonerate. Liberals NEVER face the consequences of what they do. It's just one of the many reasons we HAVE to keep them out of power."
'This to me seems more and more like Mueller was put in place to cover up everything.'
"I don't believe this- not one bit.\nEverything we know tells us the fortunes of the Clinton's-Obama's-Podesta's-Comey-Mueller ALL inextricably linked.\nThis is pure BS- Mueller might claim to go after Podesta's to lock down information and prevent it's release- solidify cover up- provide immunity and absolution\nSame as was done by Comey during the supposed server investigation. He gave immunity to all material witnesses- to silence them- or permit their lies unchallenged- either way\nNOT A CHANCE Mueller truly goes after Podesta's"

"So, if Trump declassifies today, does that free Members up to discuss it then, even if the memo itself isn't released until tomorrow?"
'Looks like we are going to get 4 pages full of black squares. '
'In the end it might be best to simply let the 5 days run out.  From what I understand if President Trump does not object it automatically will be released after 5 days.  That would avoid the whole explosive issue being pinned on him and blunt any claims of obstruction in the Muller "investigation".'

"Surely this was not written by either Comey or Strzok, but by a lower level group or person within the FBI. Then the document is passed up the chain and revisions are made. I wonder how that group or person feels about what transpired? Wouldn't it be interesting if that group/person within the FBI started to talk? Wouldn't it be interesting if that group/person were called to testify at congress, or at the IG's probe?\n\nComey and Strzok  have committed treason/sedition/conspiracy against the people of the United States. They should be dealt with to the full extent of the law. Perhaps a deal for them to be truthful and to give the whole story. Might I suggest life imprisonment instead of firing squad?"
'Here is the key question:\n\nWhat blackmail dirt did they have on Comey that they were able to force him to accept these edits??\nIn other words, if he was originally willing to basically incriminate Clinton, how could he allow it to be twisted like this into a forced exoneration letter? They either blackmailed or bribed him. Or he was in on it all along??'

"The most shocking thing about Trump isn't how he's fixed the US economy. It isn't how he's bringing about world peace.  \n\nIt's how easy he's making it look. How is he making it all look so easy?"
'i think the wider public might be starting to realise what having a no-nonsense businessman in the white house is actually like. '
"The the DNC hates peace. GOPe hates it too. Embedded SES \\- yup...\n\nWhat to do... What to do...\n\nPursue peace! And don't get Arkancided,,,,,"

'Pretty sure they only give Nobel prizes to people that mutilate their bodies and call themselves a different gender and "scientists" that predict the end of the world via "climate change" and blame it on whatever group is the flavor of the month to hate on.\n\nIt\'s not a crowd that President Trump needs to be apart of.'

"I was one of the ones that were screaming this. So much energy. I won't be sleeping tonight. I'm going to just stay up and work for the next day or so. I feel the need to work. MAGA. Such a good rally!"

"Let's not forget that Rod recommended the James Comey firing which then led to the special counsel that HE HIMSELF appointed!  Unreal."
'He wasn’t supposed to win '
"My liberal co-workers are furious. I mean the butt-hurt level left 11 behind and is now rising to 25. I haven't seen them this furious since November 9th, 2016.\n\nThey are angry and raising their voices. They are talking over each other. It’s hilarious. It’s like they’re drowning and clinging to each other to not drown and aren’t aware that they’ll only end up drowning as a group.\n\nSummary: The memo is fake! There’s still a chance for impeachment because the Republicans won’t allow the release of the Democrat memo which is the real memo that says the Nunes memo is wrong so all we have is a fake memo and that means Hillary still has a chance to win. One quote: “If you had a brain at all, you’d know this is probably a sham since there’s another memo so why would there be another memo if the first one wasn’t full of lies?”\n\nThen they went into how the investigation will go on and how Mueller will present his findings and they should keep it going till November when the results will make the most impact even though the Republican Congress won’t vote to impeach but Trump is guilty as hell and no phony memo is going to change their mind and if the findings about collusion and obstruction are really bad, it will help Democrats take back Congress.\n\nThe champagne is still in the refrigerator; it’s getting really cold; they can’t wait to open the bottle.\n\n(!!!)\n\nIt’s fascinating. They are determined to die on Muh Russia Hill; the contents of the memo mean nothing to them, because they are so invested in getting rid of the orange jerky jerk face, and they are so dedicated to Hillary, Obama, et al, that I think we could present video evidence of Hillary baking cookies mixed with the baby parts from Planned Parenthood and they’d still say she should be president because she won the popular vote and Russia hacked the election.\n\nThey’re acting as if this memo truly means nothing, and thus nothing will change, but if what we’ve read is anything close to the truth, I cannot imagine how Mueller can keep going."
'I think what we all learned today is to never, ever, under any circumstances ever talk to or contact the FBI about anything ever again.  \nTerrorist plot?  Grab a firearm and handle it yourself.  \nThe FBI can no longer be trusted for anything.  \nThanks, Obama.  '
'I’m absolutely amazed at how nothing about this memo is on the front page or /all/. But surprised? No. It’s fucking reddit censoring as usual. '
'It’s time for final preperarions folks. The 2nd amendment exists for this purpose. When the liberals try to break the law and remove President Trump, we all must stand up and defend him with every means possible and available to us as citizens.\n\nWe are ready up here in New Hampshire.'
'The memo highlights the fact that they had nothing on Trump, they had to make up a fan fiction in order to get anything on their application!'
'let me get this straight all those involved are saying this memo NOW means nothing... \n\nbut just yesterday: STOP!!!! THIS WILL END AMERICA!!!'
'Nunes is savage on Fox News right now. Love this guy. '
'Well Carter Page was under surveillance since 2013, so how is the dossier considered as the thing that initiated his FISA warrent? '
'Man it feels good to drain the swamp '
'Surely this will be the end of trump!'
'Dems would impeach regardless of legal precedent.  You can take that to the bank !'
'And despite all that, if they dems get enough seats, they’ll still successfully impeach trump for no reason.\n\nFucking traitors, the lot of them.'
"Another juicy tidbit that's not being mentioned enough.  The total number of FISA applications since the start of the secret court, the total number of FISA warrants issued, the percentage of successful FISA applications, and the fact that the initial FISA application against the Trump campaign was denied.  It's astonishing.  See for yourself."
'Nothing on redacted is ever this thoughtful. '
'Donald Trump must be the cleanest person out there....investigatuons starting may 2016 and find absolutely nothing.  Makes me even prouder'

'#🎶MY EYES HAVE SEEN THE GLORY OF RELEASING OF THE MEMO🎶'
"I've been basically dancing around my house today like a goof. I can't dance worth shit! But I can't help it!! Weeee dawggie "
'So they used the FISA on Page as the thin end of a wedge to spy on the whole Trump team. And the FISA was obtained by hiding the bias, effectively by spinning a story to the court and saying "Trust us"'
"Hopefully Trump's team of lawyers is all over this."
' James Comey, June 8, 2017 testimony:\n\n> The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified.  Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing.\n\n Observe: Comey testified that he saw the dossier as a "salacious and unverified" attempt to discredit the President. Therefore on January 6, 2017 he personally briefed the President on the dossier to defend the incoming President. \n\n October 21, 2016; three months prior to that briefing, the FBI/DOJ FISA warrant application depends on the same dossier in order to get a warrant to spy on Carter Page. This warrant is renewed three times.\n'
'Jim Acosta got btfo.  The only way this entire episode could have gone better is if they would have had him escorted from the building; which they should have.'
'The press are supposed to report the news, not to become the news.  Reporters at a press conferences are not supposed to be opinion journalists.   The MSM loves to blur the lines between anchors, reporters and editorialists.  I agree with /u/BitsoupLol, infra.  This administration was elected.  CNN was not.  CNN is not without rights.  CNN can listen, take notes, and then report.  There is no right to argue with the White House during a press conference.  This was totally inappropriate.'
'Jim Acosta is a moron that thinks only white people speak English. Did he forget about South Africa, New Zealand, and India? Did he also forget that people of any background are perfectly capable of learning English? '
'I was hoping Miller would go further in treating him like a stupid schoolboy: "Jim, come stand up here in front of the class.  Okay, can anyone help Jim with the answer?  Hands up and no talking before I call on you, please."'
'The White House needs to PUBLICLY just go ahead and tell CNN they are free to send another reporter but Acosta is no longer welcome and will not be admitted to the WH press pool gatherings any more.'

Between all the highway shutdowns and protesting around fairs and just otherwise shutting down traffic, they have garnered the ill will of the nation.\n\nGender - Everyone I know has been rolling their eyes at all the invented genders and most people are not that concerned about a wage gap given that women are generally already ahead when adjusting for leave time.\n\nWe live in a time where minorities, women, enjoy benefits white males do not.

'I visited Paris for the last time a few years ago. Will not be back. There was a definite shift that had not previously been there. Specifically at the Eiffel Tower- we were a bit on edge with the certain types selling trinkets sort of aggressive and, sure enough, a gang of ... gypsies (men, though)... robbed a woman. This was crowded at mid-day and her husband/SO was with her.  I didn’t see it happen because the gang surrounded her and then scattered- it happened very, very fast. Her screams lasted long after they ran away like roaches.  \n\nLater, our taxi driver acknowledged attacks may occasionally happen but best not to dwell... lovely day in Paris, after all! \n\nWe travel far and frequently.

All the stuff about him converting to Islam, having a partner, etc also looks more and more likely as the media tries to black the story out. \n\nWhat I’m most curious about is the timing. Did he target the concert because country = Trump supporters, or did he go off because someone needed a distraction for a few days? A distraction from Awan, perhaps, or something worse? I’m seeing a pattern of every time a big story breaks, a new story pushes it out of the news cycle before we get resolution: Awan->Vegas->Weinstein->?'

"Of course the simplest answer is that the media, both left and right, have largely quit covering it because there's no credible political angle and therefore nothing for talking heads to screech at each other about and no points to be scored or agendas to be advanced.\n\nIf, after a reasonable period of time, they can't put together a coherent timeline then you've got to question the competence of the investigation. But with the number of witness interviews they'll have to conduct and hours of security footage they'll have to review, that's a process that will take a number of weeks.\n\nIf they wanted to engage in a cover-up, you'd have a simple, consistent answers being given. On the other hand early mistakes regarding the facts of the case followed by later corrections is precisely what you would expect to see in a complex, ongoing investigation."

'Thank you President Trump'
'It’s almost as if he wants to protect our citizens ?'
"Can you imagine if Hillary we're president right now?\n\nDon't. It might hurt your brain."
'Joined specifically for T_D and I want to do is help carry some bricks.'
"I have developed an addiction to checking for the news here. It's like being part of a secret organization that isn't that secret "
"I used to be a reddit addict who occasionally browsed t_d.  Now i'm a t_d addict who occasionally browses reddit.  I know there are more like me and I know that's the reason spez hasn't killed the sub.  They know how powerful we are.  He sees the data and that my/our browsing habits have changed significantly.  If they kill this sub they are committing harikari.  "
"I'm only here to support President Trump and be a thorn in the side of Reddit."
'My disdain for Reddit is only exceeded by my love for T_D.'
'T_D and boobs are the only thing reddit is good for. '
'I first heard of Reddit in 2007.  Never visited Reddit until May 2017.  Came here for the Seth Rich redpills.  Stayed for the MAGA.'
"I can count on one hand the amount of posts/comments I've made on other subs "
"Reddit user for 10 years.  The past year it's gotten to the point that I only visit T_D, and when I venture out it's only to see what the other side is REEEEEEEEEEing about.  Redacted makes cat gif's look like a serious drama.  "
"This is the only place to get news. And encouragement. There are some minor interests on other subs, apolitical, of course. But I would have forgotten about them ages ago if I weren't constantly checking TD. "
"I'd be gone. You can't visit any sub without nerds hating on the Trump. "
"Only reason I'm here. Get motivated is worth a glance every so often. "
'I always jump straight to T_D.'
'the Donald this the only sub reddit I actively and consistently follow.'
"I used to only comment in the Jeep and Wrangler subs but now I hardly ever remember to check them. Sometimes people MAGA over there though so it's cool. "
'{raises hand to be counted}'
"I'll be honest I use a multitude of other subs and I love them but without T_D I may not use reddit as much if at all"
"If The_D didn't exist... I would make it my life's mission to red pill every other sub with truth bombs all day."
'Know what cool feature almost all boats have?\n\nNO BRAKES!!!'
'I sometime wonder if I’m dreaming.  The winning has to stop eventually... right? '
'Except when you take the wide view, there would actually be like millions of boats out there with trump flags. Were looking through Speznoculars.'
'We make the best memes. The left makes us some really good stuff, but we still make the best.'
"This guy's a personal hero of mine."
'JUST WAIT TWO MORE YEARS AND OUR BOBBY SWAN WILL SURELY HAVE SOMETHING!'
'Did you see the latest approval ratings¿ were gonna need a bigger boat...'
"It's the simple memes in life that give you the strength to carry on"
'the irony of donald doing great things is something we can all unite over.'
'The saltier the tears, the better we float'
"You're at #20 on r/all get ready for the downvote squad OP.  Being on the salt shills you can't match T_D's energy! MAGA 🇺🇸👌🐸"
'Never have I seen such a low-effort meme be so funny lol.'
'Still amazes me that these liberal idiots don’t understand that they’re painting Trump as David and the swamp as Goliath.  Everyone roots for The underdog. Maybe Trump is just that good at controlling the narrative and the libs are that bad. Probably a little of column A and a little of column B.'
'I just got home from another semi hard day at work and this is the first post popping up? Help a family man out please!'
"Cool, so that means we'll be under investigation for two years without having any dirt on us?\n\nSign me up fam"
'Unbelievable lift, believe me'
'One of my all time favorite shitposts. '
'Seems to be a direct correlation between Active Facebook users and the job rate. '
"Walmart provides cheap goods, no-barrier jobs, and pays the most taxes of any single entity in the United States. (Edit: sounds like Apple has taken that title. Walmart had it for a long time though)\n\nMcDonald's parovides cheap food, no-barrier jobs, and a network of emergency restrooms for drivers on long trips.\n\nFacebook provides no useful goods or services and contributes nothing to society."
"It's pretty hard to manipulate society with cheap cheeseburgers.  "
'Permanently deleting facebook was one of the best decisions I\'ve ever made in my life - no more wasting hours looking at nonsense that dumbs your brain.

'quit years ago and never regretted or missed it for a second.  Such a time waster.'
"Well yeah because burger joints can't make people into burgers\n\n\n**if you're not the buyer, you're the product**"
'Eventually it will read like YouTube comment section. '
'I NEVER had a FAKEbook account..never!! Thank God!!'
'haha "facebitch"'
'If you want to stay in touch with your friends, fuckin call them'
'This is an extremely true statement'
"Well yah. Another felon. Only this one is a severely autistic sociopath felon who spends his free time fisting dogs. I can't imagine why he'd run such a toxic software that makes computer viruses look benevolant all while banning and censoring people illegally"
'I still have it.  Not for politics.  I follow certain groups with similar interests and try and learn from their mistakes.  It is very useful for social networking in that regard.  I just avoid any and all political discussions. For news, I use T_D and get news faster than anywhere else.'
'Hey at least he makes good cartoons:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/oAFrHHQyLTE'
'The takeaway highlight bullet point in a nutshell is: the sole motive of a business is to make profits.\n\nif any business/corporation is pushing any agenda other than maximising returns for their investors, they must be classified as non-profits, making it impossible for them to be listed on stock exchanges or give dividends to their investors.'
'To anyone still on FaceFuck, I’m sorry. It’s going to take a lot of faith to get off that drug. And when you cross that hurdle, getting off of Amazon will seem impossible.'
"FACECUCK is social engineering at it's worst.\n\nAt least Myspace was fun"
"Don't forget that they try to control your moods based on the content they choose to show you! https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/29/facebook-users-emotions-news-feeds"

"Here's the part that blows my mind:\n\n>Republican lawmakers have spent the better part of this year investigating whether the dossier, which was funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, served as the basis for the Justice Department and the FBI to obtain FISA surveillance last year on a Trump campaign adviser named Carter Page.\n\nThey've spent a year trying to find out what was on the fisa application??? Is no one in elected government authorised to look at the damn application? Where's the oversight?"
'Wow this is the real reason he was demoted... '
'Yes!  James Rosen has a great rep.  Deputy AG knew the dossier was crap, but proceeded with it anyway.  Heck, they were all on the same page and mounting a campaign to topple the duly elected president through crimes!'
"Ohh my the salty leftist downvotes are coming in heavy like Barack Obama's period. "
'Jesus...our government is just full of corruption. Thank the lord for our GEOTUS!'
'True if big. '
' Let\'s look into who the "housekeeper" was who was photocopying classified docs for Hillary.  Maybe Rod wasn\'t bringing home enough cash and Mrs. Rosenstein needed a little pocket money? If so that\'s cool, it takes two incomes to live in the DC area.  If she wasn\'t Hillary\'s maid, what exactly does Mrs. R do for a living?'
'Another name for the surprised, not surprised list.'
'This is a significant development.  Congratulations to Jim Rosen for uncovering this. Major cover-up in motion. '
'Why does this Ohr still has a job at the DoJ? This is a serious breach of ethical procedures and this article seems to indicate that there was no disclosure involved regarding Ohr and his wife who works or worked for the firm behind Steele’s dossier.'
'Even for somebody as cynical as I am, this is pretty damn amazing. The deep state is really trying to demolish Trump. '
'I sure as hell hope that with all these Domino\'s following that someone in authority is keeping track of names.  \n\nI hope this isn\'t wishful thinking on my part.  To me keeping all these people (Falling dominos) as part of "Bigly Winning". '

'To paraphrase Comey...."no producer would make this movie" \nbecause it is too unbelievable in terms of the swamp map.'
'Well...Surprise!  Surprise!  Surprise!'
'Wow what a strange coincidence '
'That he identifies as a fucking straight white male Christian!!!'
"I'll talk to my liberal brother and he will have no idea about this guy when I bring it up. I guess between virtue signalling and work he has no time to read. Meanwhile his wife will feed him whatever her vegan self thinks is important and he'll agree with her opinion"
'This is why they\'re Fake News.  Ree\'ers take "Fake News" so literally, just like they do our President.  Yes, the news event reported is factual but important facts are omitted!  Sad!'
'> Engle, who is a concealed carry permit holder, held Samson at gunpoint until police arrived.\n\nGuns save lives '
'Wow hiding this kind of information should be illegal.'
"bu...bu...buttttt why should his nationality matter???? he's a citizen of the United States, isn't he?\n\n\n\n/s"
"Wait I'm out of the loop. Please ELI5"
'In all honesty what difference does it make, and how is it an “important detail”?\n\n> 25-year-old Emanuel Kidega Samson is originally from Khartoum, Sudan and **legally immigrated** to the United States in the 1990s. \n\nSo, he’s been here for his entire adult life, and then some. This scenario is nothing like Swedish/German refugees who come as adults and do nothing but commit crime, and in this instance I’d say the motives are unknown. '
'> 25-year-old Emanuel Kidega Samson is originally from Khartoum, Sudan and legally immigrated to the United States in the 1990s. Samson attended high school in Tennessee.\n\nSo he is a proper American, just not American-born.  Immigrant parents, raised in America.'
'Just so we have this correct for the TL;DR\n "25-year-old Emanuel Kidega Samson is originally from\xa0Khartoum, Sudan and legally immigrated to the United States in the 1990s. Samson attended high school in Tennessee."  \n\nHe was either 7 or 8 when he came from the Sudan if it was 1999.  He spent at least 18 years here in the U.S., in Tennessee.  '
"Why hasn't talked about this? Why hasn't he praised the usher as a hero? "
"So he is 25, moved to the US in the 90s (so he's born in 1992) so he was minimal age of 8.....\n\nAnd 17 years later he shoot some people, and it does care that he's an immigrant??? FUCKING WHOLE AMERICA IS A FUCKING IMMIGRANT (execpt for the native-americans)"
'Well, he legally immigrated about 20 years ago, so I don’t think his nationality needs to be mentioned. He is most definitely American.'
'This surprises me perhaps .000000126%. MAYBE.'
'They do this in English regarding Sweden as well. They\'ll say "Swedish minister" about the Italian who married Bildt. She\'s Italian, not Swedish. Thus she is a MP in the Swedish Parliament, not "A Swedish MP"\n\nDrives me nuts.'
"My favorite is when they call them youths.  As though code for Muslim immigrant weren't evident."
'>25-year-old Emanuel Kidega Samson is originally from Khartoum, Sudan and legally immigrated to the United States in the 1990s. \n\nGuy has been here for his entire life it seems. Honestly, this incident does nothing for our point on a travel ban. '

"Love how she's still missing her shoe.\n\nAlso, based old lady yelling for her to go back to Costco."
'Why is she riding on top of Chelsea? What kind of parent does this?'
'Hahaha, clever inclusion of Chelsea in this one.'
'I once tweeted Ben asking him to always portray "Her" wearing only one shoe. Since then, she\'s only had one shoe. I like to think I did my part :P\n'
'And the donkey lost a shoe too, I love Ben.'
"Have you ever laughed while throwing up in your mouth?\n\nThat's what I did when I heard Paula Revere. "
'She must really be spiraling down.  You would think bill or Chelsea would tell her not to make a fool of herself.  Go garden or something.'
'If the Russians are working with anyone it\'s the Democratic Party. I mean c\'mon - the guy who essentially won the party\'s primary was a "socialist" a.k.a communist. Antifa and Leftists love the idea of communism and are willing to violently oppose anyone who disagrees with it. I don\'t think we\'ve seen conservatives fighting for anything Russia-related. '
'Looks like all the people yelling are from Blue States.'
'Please let her run again '
'Jeff Sessions, please do your job!  Lock her up!'
'I am glad this guy is on the right, he is the GOAT.'

'If Obama "knew" about Russian hacking attempts but did nothing to combat it and also being on hot mic stating he would have more flexibility after the election... wouldn\'t this have more grounds of investigating than the witch hunt going on now?'
'We’re lucky to have him.'

'That was the original version. It was updated to include "under God" in 1954.'
'God doesn’t belong in our government'
'The Pledge didn\'t originally have "Under God" in it.  It wasn\'t amended to have it until 1954.'
'"Under God" wasn\'t added till the 50s.'
'It should be taken out. Good on ya Google. '
'WHEN YOU START A WAR WITH GOD, GOD WINS EVERY TIME!'
'The phrase under god was added in the 50s so it’s just showing the old format'
'To be fair, the original pledge didn’t have the “under god” part. It was added around the 1950s or so\n\nEDIT: Nevermind. Didn’t read properly. Didn’t see that google was claiming to use the 1954 version. '
'Unpopular opinion. *One nation under God* wasnt added until 1954. Google is just being a patriot, saying it how its supposed to be said. As Edward Bellamy intended. Not everything in this country is about god'
'That was added back in the day. Under God is not an official pledge.'
"The original pledge if allignece didn't have that line in it. It wasn't added until the 50s."
"For some reason it's picking up the 1923 version. I think it's funny that you call Google commies for listing a prior version of the Pledge of Allegiance. That's the opposite of patriotic."
'Its grabbing from Wiki. Just go in and add "Under God" it is a public website that has public authors. '
'I consider myself a patriot and I\'m torn on this. "Under good" was inserted in 1954. If you\'re a Christian, you\'re probably fine with or without it. It doesn\'t add much, really.'
"According to the page, that is the original 1892 version. 'Under God' wasn't added until 1954.\n"
'Which god are we talking about'
'Will you idiots quit using Goolag already? I keep seeing "Google this, Google that" posts. STOP USING IT. I just checked this out on Bing and it had the Pledge with "Under God" included. It is a great search engine (especially for porn). It isn\'t anonymous like Startpage or DuckDuckGo, but the search results are 10000x more accurate. Not as good as Google, but it doesn\'t have the shitlib bias either.\n\nI believe in Bing. It\'s a good place. They respect important days Goolag does not.'
"Originally the Pledge of Allegiance didn't have Under God. It was added later to distance even more from the communist rise. Google is just pulling one of the several revisions from Wikipedia. The United States wasn't and still isn't a Christian nation. There are plenty of non religious people in the US. "
"There's a reason the pledge of allegiance was written without any reference to God. It was only until the 1950's that Christian fundamentalists added it to the pledge.  "
'Regurdless of political standing, I support the removal of "under god" in the pledge. '

'>If you’re one of the black folks who’s worried about our people’s economic prospects in this country, remember that the key isn’t finding a scapegoat or a shortcut to the problem at hand. Closing inequality between black and white can’t be done by building a wall to keep out people, who in many instances, look like you. Instead, it begins with the very real work of addressing the institutional racism that has been essential to this country long before there was even a border to cross.\n\nThe wall IS key to rebuilding our economic prospects, because ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS undercut American workers, including BLACK workers. So yes, let\'s address the institutional racism coming from the party of segregation, the party that\'s done everything they can to keep us at each other\'s throats, the party that would be very happy to replace Americans with more compliant servants from the Third World. Americans are too "uppity".\n\n'

It’s because they’ve run out of ideas and people have started to realize that there are better things to do than to devote your life to entertainment.\n\nThat being said, liberals are taking a huge hit from the entertainment industry failing, because from a liberal’s perspective, there’s nothing in the world more important than art. Liberals think entirely with their emotions and art is a way of making emotions tangible. Without a successful entertainment industry, liberal logic will die out because they’ll have to start relying on actual logic if they want to convince anyone of anything.'

'Interesting how those numbers are [a total lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_in_the_United_States_by_household_income#By_race), and that Asian households have a median income nearly twice that of white households.\n\nAlmost like there\'s a racial motivation here, but surely that can\'t be...\n\nEDIT:  Noticed that Crazy Bernie\'s numbers are "wealth," not "income," but I have no idea if the former\'s ever been reliably recorded.'

If bernie wants to take peoples money and give to the less well off why not take it from people who have made their fortunes from the usery of other people.'
'Ah. I remember when all my white friends turned into adults, and went down and got their $116,000 check, and I went down and got my $2,000 check.\n\nBecause that’s how it works. Not by personal gain and hard work, it’s just set up like that.\n\n/s'

"It's almost like Trump was right about Trump Tower being wiretapped and his campaign being spied on... \n\n\u2003\u2003 \n\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to add that Manafort at the time was Trump's campaign chairman. Every private conversations between Trump and Manafort were wiretapped. That's essentially the same as wiretapping Trump.  And the fact that we are only just learning about Manafort now means there's probably more Trump associates living in Trump tower who were all wiretapped similarly by the Obama administration. "
'there is some fuckery afoot. I saw that CNN was reporting this, they only report the truth when they have to cover up a bigger lie. Wonder what that bigger lie is? '
'So, I was privy to many of those conversations. Nothing bad of course... Mainly delegate situation. '

'By pushing the Seth Rich narrative, Brazile will be able to claim all the bad stuff she did was "under duress" as she feared for her life.\n\nWhether she believes or knows about Seth Rich is irrelevant, she\'s trying to protect her ass.'
"She's been 'whistling' Seth Rich on at least four occasions that I've counted.  I don't know how more obvious you could get.  \n\nIF it came out that it was Seth as the leak, and not Russian Phishers (not the same as hacking as the press says it was) it would change everything.... EVERYTHING!"

"I'm just curious as to whether Seth's parents have received any lump sums in the past year."

'How fucking dystopian does "Twitter Government" sound? Can you imagine if those fuckers actually were a government, as they clearly wish to be?\n\nIt\'s almost as bad as their "Trust and Safety Council".'
'Normally those accounts have access restrictions.  When I worked at a company in which we dealt with government officials if you so much as typed a certain high ranking officials name into the dialog box of the account lookup screen you’d have security walking you out so fast your head would spin.'

Not enough Frenchmen? Send in lookalike Spaniards: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7984436.stm\n\n* Footnote: It\'s always curious to me that Americans have a similar colonial set-up and history and understand that Saxons from England aren\'t the same thing as Navajos in the U.S., but are utterly convinced that Spaniards back in Europe are supposed to be Aztecs from Mexico, lol. It\'s like they don\'t understand that (just as with their own history) Spain had the Europeans who sailed to the New World and forced Indians to speak a European language (but are not themselves Indians). One is a European colonizer, the other is the Native colonized. The two are no more related to  each other than a German is related to an Inuit.

None of the recent Cuckflix stuff has really interested me except the new Stranger Things which was OK not  nearly as good at the first season of it."

They won\'t get a cent from me.'

'
'Democrats care more about illegals than Americans.'
'Trump should sign an EO that takes all wages for government employees that did not work during the shutdown and reallocates them into a fund for building the wall. The longer the shutdown continues, the greater the sum of money collected for funding the wall.'

"The Democrats depended on the black vote and they didn't have enough support among them to get Hillary elected or there just wasn't enough of them.

No, thanks.\n\nMarsha Blackburn is a political opportunist leeching off of taxpayers. She doesn\'t represent anyone but herself and the political elites in Washington, who undoubtedly tell the dumbass how to vote because she is dense as a box of rocks. She will ride Trump\'s name as long as she can benefit from it and dump him the moment it becomes politically expedient to do so.\n\nI will not be voting for her.

"Percentages aside, we are the country (Romania) with the lowest wages in EU, at par with Bulgaria. Note we contribute more than Germany, France, Spain, Italy.

"The US spends far more than that on the military. I did a breakdown a long time ago and I can assure you that the US spends upwards of 1.1 to 1.2 trillion.\n\nFor example, our nuclear arsenal is handled by the [Department of Energy](http://dailycaller.com/2017/01/19/why-does-the-energy-department-control-the-nuclear-arsenal/). This funding isn't counted in military spending but it is clearly military. So we add money to that 685 number. Then there's the collaboration between NASA and the Air Force which isn't free. Then we have unfunded liabilities (disability payments, retirement, pensions, etc...) that is handled by the VA. That adds a couple hundred billion alone, not to mention the cost of the VA itself. That is military spending regardless of how you want to spin it. There are dozens of other items like this you can find. \n\nBack in 2012, I heard Ron Paul state that number and didn't understand where it came from. So I began digging. A few other people did as well so I believe this stuff is available if you want to look for it.\n\nAs much as I love our military, it is an incredibly wasteful organization. Everyone knows the story of how the Army spent Five Billion Dollars ($5,000,000,000) on the camoflage they are now looking to replace because it sucks so badly. This doesn't end at the US Army. "

"He's absolutely correct. Unsubstantiated allegations notwithstanding, there were significant problems with Moore as a candidate. We *cannot* continue running candidates that are caricatures of what leftists think conservatives are. Roy Moore was a backwards thinking, evolution-denying, Bible thumping loon who believes the Constitution is second to his interpretation of Scripture. I am a Christian, but your faith CANNOT be a cornerstone of your campaign and CANNOT be a substitute for an argument.\n\nFurthermore, leftists will continue substituting arguments with allegations that are nearly impossible to prove. They now know they can try this and WIN. The best course of action is to call them out on it, deny it, and throw it back in their faces. They don't care about sexual abuse. That much is clear based on their history. Let's let them know we consider this a war as well, because they sure do."

There's an article about Ivanka's childhood on the frontpage of one newspaper though lol. \n\nFound one from 2015: [The White House claims it does not know anything about Russian donations to the Clinton Foundation](https://ria.ru/world/20150423/1060524340.html)\n\n> Russian government funds paid to the Uranium One company owners could have ended up on the accounts of the Clinton Foundation. However, there are no direct testimonies that the business deal had any political implications. \n\nEdit: So it's actually a Canadian company, not an American one?\n\n> The article, in January 2013, detailed how the Russian atomic energy agency, Rosatom, had taken over a Canadian company with uranium-mining stakes stretching from Central Asia to the American West. The deal made Rosatom one of the world’s largest uranium producers and brought Mr. Putin closer to his goal of controlling much of the global uranium supply chain.\n\n> But the untold story behind that story is one that involves not just the Russian president, but also a former American president and a woman who would like to be the next one.

"We're gonna pay to arm teachers when we already can't supply them properly otherwise? C'mon guys, we're better than this."
"I don't necessarily agree that arming teachers is the solution. If they want to be armed they should be allowed to be, but I think it's a little silly to think that every teacher should be armed. I think hiring private security is the way to go."
'So interesting that the Libs response to school shootings solutions is the same as the response to immigration and DACA..........."No". 😐 '
'I don’t know if I’d want my teachers in high school armed.  There was a couple that were real snap-shows.  I liked the armed guards idea, but something about teachers having one just makes me nervous.'
'First Democrats create gun free zones.  Then Democrats shoot up a bunch of people in gun free zones, including Republican Senators.  Now Democrats want your guns.'
"That would be putting an unfair burden onto teachers. They have a right to own a gun sure, but forcing them to carry at school, put themselves in harms way, and take the life of a child? That isn't something they sign up for when they decided to become teachers. We have plenty of qualified police members who took that oath to protect and serve. In the court system we force judges to spend a few years presiding over juvenile or family law cases. I think the same thing could be implemented here where police officers have a probationary period where they work within the school for a year. It could also be a viable option for veterans when they come home. It shouldn't be seen as some lower form of policing either, protecting our nations youth is a job you can be proud of. We don't need to arm teachers we need to arm people who know what they are doing and put them into places where they can save lives. "
'This is one directive I can’t get behind. There’s no way arming teachers is the best method for thwarting school shootings.'
"Rather than arm teachers, I'd rather see more security at schools. Make it so a teacher, if they choose, can bring their firearm to the classroom. But not mandatory. "

"The solution is to give a kindergarten teacher a 9mm handgun to carry with her in her classroom of walking tornado 5 year olds? C'mon. Get real. That's not a solution."
"That doesn't seem like the solution as over 90% of teachers don't want to be armed. We can't force guns onto people. This solution has been discussed and detected by the people implementing it. I don't think banning guns solves things either though this is a ridiculous suggestion. "

The sportball field was Crappernick\'s "workplace" (I use that term loosely since these grown ass men are being paid millions to play a highly refined version of a schoolyard game). If you politicize the workplace, you deal with consequences, whether you\'re a construction laborer (fired) or a CEO (hit in the pocketbook by consumers who are tired of your shit and decide to go elsewhere).

They were paranoid that he was going to hijack [a failing] party and put it back on a better track (away from identity politics to a leftist version of economic nationalism), much like Trump did to the GOP. Fortunately, the RNC wasn't built by design to prevent populist uprisings, unlike the superdelegate system the DNC had.

'Please note, the accumulated trade deficits of over 12 Trillion dollars mainly went to China, today our #1 geopolitical and military rival.  Thanks to this influx of cash, they now enjoy the world’s #2 economy and access to western industrial secrets - whereas before Bush 1, they were backwards and poor and not considered a major threat.\n \nThis is where “free trade” has taken us.  America once had a central rule - No Trading with Communists.  Leaders spoke of the importance of letting the Chinese dragon sleep.  At the time, most US consumer products were manufactured in America or imported from friendly nations who also stood against communism.  I recall from those times that the American middle class had everything it wanted easily available, and the products were of high quality generally.  We knew that our industrial capabilities provided a fortress for the nation in case of a world war - just as it did in WW2, when the factories quickly converted from producing consumer goods to supporting our soldiers with war materials.\n \nFor the sake of saving a few pennies on consumer items, this is where the globalists have taken America.  A hollow and dying industrial base, the loss of our hard-won intellectual property and manufacturing secrets, and facing a now-wealthy and dangerously empowered rival (who wields trade as just another weapon against us).'

South? Not specified,) China, Ecuador, and Vietnam.** (Interestingly, illegal immigrants from majority-ROP jihad enthusiast nations don\'t make this list.)\n\n\n\n\nAlso interesting: that website lists the top occupations that employed illegal immigrants in 2008. #1 was **Brickmasons, blockmasons, and stonemasons.** \n\n\n\n\nMy personal experience supports this: I recently had work done at my house, and hired a company of guys I know personally. I specified that I wanted no illegal immigrants whatsoever on my property, and certainly none working on this job. Surprise surprise, they subcontracted another local contractor to do the brick/blockwork, who showed up with a dozen non-English-speaking presumably Hispanic "workers" who did a rather shoddy job. They were already half-done by the time I saw this, or I would have sent them packing. Oh well, I will have to content myself with reporting them to ICE.

"IL pede here.\n\nIllegals don't get drivers licenses in IL.  We have TVDL's - Temporary Visitor Driver's Licenses.  They specifically say right on the front in red NOT VALID FOR IDENTIFICATION and they also look different.  I've never actually seen one in person - not sure how often they're actually issued, as I have never actually seen one in person.\n\nOP may be confusing this with Chicago, which recently announced they would be issuing a city-wide ID card for anyone - but especially illegals since they can't get any other valid ID.  In this case, it is up to local election boards to decide if they want to take them as ID - and I will bet many precincts will not be allowing them, if any of them do.  I will definitely not be the only one here watching to see if any local election boards are planning to accept them for voter registration.  Additionally, though - this story is about Lake County.  That's not Chicago.  So these are people who were living in the far north suburbs and voting illegally.\n\nThe important point, I think here, is that it can happen anywhere.  This is something that can happen anywhere - it is not unique to Chicago or Illinois.  These are people who flat-out lied during voter registration by attesting that they were eligible to vote.  I guarantee this is not only happening here.  This is happening everywhere people are trying to get away with this.

"There's a pretty simple answer to this one really:\n\nBecause the FBI didn't think Trump would win."
"What's been clear is that the FBI is really more of a counter intel operation rather than a criminal investigative / law enforcement body. Just look at the way they handled the Clinton email probe (1) the didn't know about stone tear (2) they gave immunity for shit information (immunity should be to get somebody to throw target under the bus for successful prosecution) (3) they let targets sit in as counsel for another target (4) they did compel DNC to hand over their servers (5) they relied on conclusions of Crowd Strike etc etc etc."
'> Because the FBI totally NEVER intervenes.\n\nThey would rather hang onto any information they find and try to use it to gain leverage over the president. They tried to do this with the [Steele dossier](https://larouchepub.com/other/editorials/2017/4424_lar_stop_fbi_fraud_coup.html):\n\n"Here’s how the actual conspiracy worked in general outline. According to Comey’s own words and their actual implication, on January 6, two weeks before Trump’s inauguration, FBI Director Comey is selected by Obama’s intelligence chiefs to do a “J. Edgar Hoover” on Trump, briefing him on salacious blackmail material fabricated by British intelligence and Clinton campaign operative Christopher Steele. It is a pure Hoover blackmail operation.\n\nComey signals to Trump, “give up your fantasy about cooperation with Russia and we won’t release this.” Trump doesn’t budge. The very next day the whole Steele dossier is leaked all over the international news media, accusing the President-elect of perverse sexual acts with Russian hookers. Comey admitted as much in his testimony June 8, saying **he was aware that that briefing could be construed as a “J. Edgar Hoover moment,**” in response to a question from Senator Susan Collins of Maine."'

'This guy is a real example of character & integrity (NOT) - A little bedtime History story:  \n\nThe slime story starts in 1977 probably before Spez and 90+% of the people on here were born.  \n  \nHe was appointed as a Federal Judge in Florida by President Carter.  \n  \nIn 1981 he was charged with accepting a $150,000 bribe in the  racketeering case against Frank and Thomas Romano this bribe was in exchange for a light sentence and the return of their seized assets.  As a Cherry on Top he was also charged with perjury because of his testimony about the case.  \n  \nHe stayed on as a Judge  \n  \nIn 1983, he was acquitted by a jury after his alleged co-conspirator, Attorney William Borders, refused to testify in court and went to jail.    \n  \nHe stayed on as a Judge  \n  \nIn 1988, the ***Democrat Controlled*** House of Representatives took up the case, and Hastings was impeached for bribery and perjury by a vote of 413–3.   \n  \nHe stayed on as a Judge\n  \nIn 1989 he was convicted by the ***Democrat Controlled*** United States Senate - (Robert Byrd D KKK Presiding)  \n  \nHe became the ***the sixth federal judge*** in the history of the United States to be removed from office by the Senate.  \n  \nThe Senate, in two hours of roll calls, voted on 11 of the 17 articles of impeachment and convicted him on 8 of the 11  articles.   \n  \nHe was fired as a Judge - ***BUT*** -   \n  \nThe Senate had the option to ban him from ever holding Federal Office again, they did not do so.  \n  \nRemember his co-conspirator William Borders? he went to jail again for refusing to testify in the impeachment proceedings.  - ***But Wait***  \n  \nHe was later given a full pardon by President Bill Clinton on his last day in office.  \n  \nAs for Hastings  \n  \nIn 1993 the new Florida 23rd District was Created   \n  \nHastings was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1992, representing this new district which has been his (in corruption) ever since.  \n  \n2009 was a good ethical year first he voted to impeach Texas federal judge Samuel B. Kent on all four counts presented.  This was also the year that The Wall Street Journal reported that in 2008 he spent over $24,000 in taxpayer money, meant to pay for office expenses,  to lease a luxury Lexus hybrid sedan.  It was **determined** that this was a legitimate and acceptable use of Taxpayers money.  \n  \nThis guy could be the poster boy for a life of corruption and unethical behavior because in 2012 he was ranked ***First*** in all of the members of the House of Representatives for paying salaries and fees to family members, #1 out of 435 - Stellar Performance,   \n  \nAn independent report in 2012 had this nugget of interest:  \n  \nAlcee Hastings (self):\n\n• During the 2010 election cycle, Rep. Hastings’ campaign committee reimbursed Rep. Hastings $15,674 for travel and event expenses.   \n\nPatricia Williams (girlfriend):   \n\n• Ms. Williams is Rep. Hastings’ deputy district director. 6 Between 2007 and 2010, Rep. Hastings’ congressional office paid Ms. Williams $622,574. 7 Her most recent annual salary was $166,000. 8 In addition, Rep. Hastings owes Ms. Williams, a lawyer, between $500,001 and $1,000,000 for defending him during an impeachment trial. \n  \n\n\n  \n'
">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcee_Hastings#Judicial_career_(1977–1989)\n\nThat's quite impressive to be honest.

"The Chelsea Clinton thing will be interesting going forward, mostly as a barometer for just how out-of-touch the Democrat Party actually is. \n\nAcross America (even among rank-and-file Democrats, I'd imagine), there is ZERO appetite for a Chelsea Clinton candidacy. Absolutely no one is demanding it. No one is looking to Chelsea for leadership or vision on anything of import. I mean, MAYBE if she finds the right state or district, she can get elected to Congress, but as far as her national campaign prospects, Chelsea's would be, much like her mother's campaign, doomed to fail before it ever began, for a whole host of reasons.\n\nSurely top Democrats understand this, just as I'm sure many of them understood it about Hillary. But they weren't strong/brave/powerful enough to convince Hillary she wasn't the national candidate America wanted and found themselves losing to Donald Trump. \n\nBy the time Chelsea decides to run, I wonder if the Democrat Party will have any adults left in it who will squash the Chelsea nonsense before it gets too big. If not, then they're gonna be living deja vu all over again as they pin their hopes to another Clinton who will inevitably go down in flames."

What if the Iran deal was the set up to a nuclear false flag?\n\nNow hear me out.\n\nThe nuclear materials sold to Russia and then to Iran would be indistinguishable from nuclear materials ised in an American made nuclear weapon according to science used to trace nuclear materials to their original source.\n\nTheoretically a nuke given to Israel using nuclear materials from a US source would have the same signature as a nuke made in Iran from nuclear materials from that same source sold to Russia as a go between to Iran.\n\nSo in short, two nukes, same materials, one iran one Israel, no way to tell who set it off. \n\nNow imagine a nuke in the USA going off. They test the material and look it\'s the same as iran (and Israel). We either nuke Tehran or use conventional warfare and who would benefit once the dust settles? Oh look, there\'s an "ally" right next door who would be getting endless funds and would have a huge swath of land it could expand into as these hostile nations surrounding it would likely become occupied after engaging coalition forces.\n'

'But dems care about the dreamers! (They don’t)'
"It's obvious that the Democrats are desperately scrambling in search of an issue that will get them some traction.  This is difficult for them to do, because they are genuinely opposed to essentially all policies that would help normal Americans.  If they continue to find no issue that resonates with voters, expect the 2018 elections to be nothing but personal attacks from them.  It will be all they have to run on.  "

'The Democrats just want Trump out. They could care less about DACA unless they can use it for their political purposes. '
'So if the date passes and we get Supreme Court to overturn they’d all immediately be going right?'
'They’re focused right now on milking the deaths of schoolchildren'

"I agree with you, but one thing . . . they keep toppling ME governments so two countries can ultimately rule the ME.  And the pipeline, if they had gotten rid of Assad, was to destroys Russia's economy.  Which would have caused WWIII, IMHO.  And she promised WWIII to her donors.  If she won, we would have been in a WW, I think.  That is what she still wants and have to look forward to, besides globalism, if they accomplish what they are trying to do now.  Mueller had to be fired.  The people need to know the truth.  The above is a drop in the bucket compared to all their crimes."

'That feeling is understandable, but this is a lonnnnggg game being played.  If you were to go after Hillary right after inauguration, before everything is lined up and all the pieces *and players* are in position, the country would be torn apart.  \n\nWhen you govern a nation, you have to be aware of how much they can bend in your direction before breaking...little by little, you get there.'
'Because that makes her such a better person /s time for you to get deported from here'
'My understanding is if the petro-dollar collapses, which happens if we stop meddling, the US economy collapses. We\'d need a much stronger economy than we have to divest ourselves of the middle east at this point, if that\'s true. It might explain why Trump "plays ball" with the ME. He may not like them, but business is business. You just try to get the best deal, if you\'re forced to deal at all.'

"Do people actually read these political books, or is buying one just just a way to support the author? Truth be told, I bought Been Carson's book (way back before Trump was even running) but only read 1 chapter.  I also bought multiple books by Michael Savage but never finished reading them. Personally I buy them to show my support. "

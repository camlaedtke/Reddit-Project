Koreans are now huge fans of Mr. Trump (I'm Korean),kangdol5890,1524925021.0,15355,VERIFIED,self.The_Donald,"'Hi.\nI\'m native Korean who have been living in the southern part of the peninsula for 21 years.\nI want to share some recent approval(is this word appropriate?) and sentiment toward Mr. Trump and an opposite veto and negative sentiment toward Obama and Hillary here in Korea.\nI\'ve never been to any English speaking country for a single day and I learned English only through school education and private academy... hence my English is broken and poor, so please understand if there are some points you can not grasp, are some words that are inappropriate and weird.\n\nFirst, before introducing what\'s going on in Korea now, you have to understand media environment in South Korea. Some attributes are different but in many points both media in SK and US are corrupt and unreliable. Basically, unlike those in the anglosphere, Koreans have little interest on global/diplomatic issues if they are not related to the peninsula\'s problem. We have tons of professional experts on the North/South issue, but very little on other global affairs(except for Far East relation/problems). This is also applied to the field of media, so almost every Korean media gather first information through the so-called mainstream media of US(+BBC). This clearly means that their biased and purposed opinion and frame are regarded as very impartial, neutral and objective.\nSo during the election campaign period, Korean media depicted Trump as maniac, psychopath and immoral trash. They literally demonized Trump as the ""mainstream media"" in the US did. It worked quite well for a while, but as Trump was elected many Koreans got to have doubt on this reckless bombards from our media. \'If he is so bad human being, how the hell he was able to make it? There must be economic/social/cultural issues that were usually ignored(maybe purposely) by media.\' This was the most common skepticism that we had witnessing the entire campaigns and coverage on them. (+ Our media were very shocked about the result of the election, and they started to analyze how this was possible. They explained something like \'the fury and frustration of workers in the Rust Belt felt toward Democratic party\' blah blah blah, but they never quit the habit of demonizing Trump for some months.)\nAlso, our ex-president Î∞ïÍ∑ºÌòú(Park Geun-Hye) was impeached for various felonies she committed, including engagement on state-run media. Those who gave up the role of watchdog against power now declared that they reflect on their past and will fully function as neutral, impartial, truth-seeking media.\nBut these turn out to be lies nowadays. Although some media have functioned quite well like they declared, many of them are just fucks. People are realizing that media are intrinsically just business seeking its own money and interest, and they will do whatever to achieve that even if it\'s political maneuvering or fact distortion. Reporter, which had been respected vocation through the period of strife for democratization in this country, is now despised. The fact that many people call Í∏∞Ïûê(reporter) Í∏∞Î†àÍ∏∞( Í∏∞Ïûê/reporter + Ïì∞Î†àÍ∏∞/trash) clearly shows this.\n\nSecond, Koreans now evaluate the president of our most confidential ally, the United States of America, by actual policies he/she impose and affect on real world, rather than virtual reputation/image which are so vulnerable to being manipulated and plotted by few purposed individuals. You guys may have been once heard of praises and appreciations from our president Moon on Mr. Trump\'s maximum pressure policies for the situation now happening in this peninsula. That is not just his own thought but typical and common thought the folks contemporarily have. \n\nTrump is called Ìä∏Î†•Ï†ú[Ìä∏ of Ìä∏ÎüºÌîÑ(=Trump) + Î†•Ï†ú of ÎßåÎ†•Ï†ú(=Ëê¨ÊõÜÂ∏ù, the emperor of Chinese medieval Ming dynasty] on the internet, and this is even a huge meme. There was an invasion of hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops against our country in 1592, which almost destroyed Ï°∞ÏÑ†(Joseon) dynasty, the preceding dynasty right before the Republic of Korea. Then, the Chinese emperor ÎßåÎ†•Ï†ú, who had refused to work and abandoned his sacred and important role of emperor for almost 20 years, miraculously started to come back to his office and ordered to send many regiments to Korea. He even payed his own treasures to purchase foods/supplies for the soldiers. With this aid and heroic victories made by most respected Korean general Ïù¥ÏàúÏã†(Yi Sun-Sin), Korea successfully expelled Japanese samurais from entire peninsula. After the war, a shrine worshipping the emperor ÎßåÎ†•Ï†ú as god was established, and kings and nobles visited there once a year for about next 300 years.\nI heard that some enthusiastic supporters of Trump call him \'God Emperor\'. This can sound hilarious to some people but for Koreans this is right.\nMany politicians including former ministers(secretary in American English?) and current lawmakers(congressmen) of the ruling party is now calling for \'Mr. Trump for Nobel Peace Prize\'. This was a joke in the beginning, but now it is getting consensus among folks and, I guarantee that this will lead to a organized movement in months if things are well solved.\nAlso, Obama\'s Nobel Peace Prize is now regarded as total bullshit. He made no empirical actions on peace/human rights but he was awarded. We now doubt that this entire thing was just a theater act designed by certain political powers. Plus he almost abandoned dealing with North Korean issues and justified/decorated this attitude with a non-sense word, ""Strategic Endurance."" He was once popular, respected and loved by Korean people but now he is viewed as a total hypocrite who is genius in image making and theater acting.\nHere are some proofs on the internet.\n\nhttps://www.fmkorea.com/index.php?mid=best&search_keyword=%EC%98%A4%EB%B0%94%EB%A7%88&search_target=title_content&document_srl=1022202578&listStyle=webzine&page=1\n\nhttps://www.fmkorea.com/index.php?mid=best&search_keyword=%EC%98%A4%EB%B0%94%EB%A7%88&search_target=title_content&document_srl=1033906961&listStyle=webzine&page=1\n\nhttp://mlbpark.donga.com/mp/b.php?m=search&p=61&b=bullpen&id=201804270016522652&select=sct&query=%EC%98%A4%EB%B0%94%EB%A7%88&user=&site=donga.com&reply=&source=&sig=hgjcHltY63eRKfX@hlj9SY-ALmlq\n\nhttp://mlbpark.donga.com/mp/b.php?m=search&p=1&b=bullpen&id=201804280016574117&select=sct&query=%EC%98%A4%EB%B0%94%EB%A7%88&user=&site=donga.com&reply=&source=&sig=hgjcHl21jhXRKfX@hlj9SY-ALmlq\n\nhttp://mlbpark.donga.com/mp/b.php?m=search&p=1&b=bullpen&id=201804270016566305&select=sct&query=%EC%98%A4%EB%B0%94%EB%A7%88&user=&site=donga.com&reply=&source=&sig=hgjcHltYk3DRKfX@hlj9SY-ALmlq\n\nThese two websites are ranked in top 5 among Korean web communities, and I just randomly picked those threads with Ïò§Î∞îÎßà(Obama) keyword in one minute. They all criticize Obama and show their thanks to Mr. Trump.\n\nSomeone even claim that if Hillary got the presidency, American troops may withdraw and the whole peninsula would be communized, but I\'ll not introduce this opinion because this can be controversial. (If you are interested, read a lecture script revealed by WikiLeaks that Hillary mentioned she wants to keep these nuclear and unification issues remained and unchanged, for national interests of the US. Personally I feel deep anger when I first saw this, because I\'m Korean. This wordings are very similar to those Globalists like Henry Kissinger use to bark.)\n\nAnyway, Koreans are so much grateful for the actions Trump made, but it is sad that no western media cover on this phenomenon. I hope one day he get praise and respect he surely deserves on his diplomatic achievements in the States. He saved entire planet and humanity from the verge of terrible nuclear war.'",8fk59n

I work at Google HQ - and my coworkers are lying to each other,techguytryingtomaga,1502234289.0,15197,,self.The_Donald,"'It\'s been a year since I last posted here (or anywhere). \n\nYou guys convinced me to vote (#MAGA) in the wake of the Pulse tragedy and Google censoring auto-fill in favor of one political candidate. (Shout out Philip DeFranco.) I haven\'t regretted a single thing.\n\nThis ""Anti-Diversity Screed"" that James published internally prompted me to log back into this account. To those who pm\'d this account this week: thanks for remembering me, and no, I\'m still not going to post my employee badge. See: James Damore.\n\nNonetheless, there\'s something I want to share with this community that a lot of you might not understand: \n\nYou guys are pretty brave. Some of you, maybe, don\'t care about repercussions. Some of you, maybe, are financially independent or otherwise untouchable. Some of you, perhaps, are lucky enough to live among like-minded people and laugh at the \'cucked\' cities and states from afar. Some of you hope that your accounts are anonymous enough that CNN can\'t act like the (gangster) mob by threatening to unleash the (SJW) mob upon you and ruin your careers.\n\nBut you\'re all pretty brave.\n\nJames was brave. And smart. And rational. And calm. And presented a well-thought out argument against discriminating on the basis of sex.\n\n**And he got fired** for wrong-think, publicly lit-up for saying things he didn\'t say -- things that literally went against what he said! - and internally flamed by a company VP for ""advanc[ing] incorrect assumptions about gender."" Of course, nobody will say what those incorrect assumptions were, nor quote where he advanced them: because James presented a pretty strong argument, and to engage with it would be too scary.\n\nNot all of us are that brave. (And maybe not all of us care so much about politics that we\'re going to ruin our careers over it. We just vote and get back to work.)\n\nThat\'s why ~a third of people internally who read James\' memo agreed with some, a lot, or most of it, and yet you can\'t seem to find any of them speaking up on campus here at HQ.\n\nThese mythical, magical, wrong-thinking conservatives, the ""real"" unicorns of Silicon Valley, the ones who shared his memo and agreed with it...where did they go???\n\nI know where, because I\'m friends with some of them. And we talked amongst ourselves about it, argued some of the facts and went and did our own research and then re-shared that research with each other in private chats. Most of these private chats ended with us agreeing with James, in-part or in-full.\n\n**And yesterday and today at the office, I saw people who I KNOW agreed with James -- seriously, I have it in writing, these are my friends -- tell their coworkers what a shame it was that people shared ""sexist"" thoughts like those, and how they ""just wanted a diverse work environment.""**\n\nThey are lying with a grimace and nobody outside our chats knows. They blend right in.\n\nAnd I don\'t fault them for it. They just want to get paid. They just want to be able to do their jobs without being shamed, fired, and publicly eviscerated in the media.\n\nSo please try to have a little empathy for these guys. Sure, maybe we aren\'t all brave martyrs for the political battles. Maybe that makes us cowards? Maybe we aren\'t so invested in this stuff that we\'ll ruin our careers for it.\n\nBut we will vote for it.\n\n#MAGA\n\n-a centipede undercover\n\nspez: thanks mods, appreciate the sticky bigly'",6shf5j

The CIA wants to enslave the public to special approved media for information about our government.",Chisesi,1518787559.0,10691,DRAIN THE SWAMP,self.The_Donald,"'This lawsuit is incredibly important. I get absolutely furious over the idea the government can give information that belongs to the public to their favorite pet reporters as a quid pro quo for flattering coverage while denying access to the average person who wants to read the information directly for themselves. \n\nBasically this system means the government is aiding the media in it\'s ability to enslave the public by forcing us to rely on the press exclusively for information about the mechanics of our own government. This is fucking infuriating. \n\nYou can see this same ""you scratch my back, I\'ll scratch yours"" in the Wikileaks Clinton emails. In exchange to access to Clinton the media agreed to ask soft ball questions, write flattering pieces and basically act as her cheerleaders. The difference is the campaign had every right to use access to Clinton as a bargaining chip for positive coverage. In what world does the fucking federal bureaucracy have the right to use information about **OUR GOVERNMENT** in order to bargain for good coverage? That information doesn\'t belong to the CIA, or to the fucking permanent bureaucrat class, it belong to CITIZENS. It\'s our fucking information about our fucking government. Just the audacity of these little pukes, their distaste for the rights of the average citizen.

The Beginning of the End of the Mueller Investigation,BamaBangs,1517596202.0,10375,#MemoDay LIVE,self.The_Donald,"'#Hello, and welcome to the beginning of the end of the Mueller Investigation.\n\nToday we\'re going to discuss the legal doctrine of the ""Fruit of the Poisonous Tree."" \n\nI want to take you back in time to 1920, where Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. delivered an opinion of the Supreme Court where this famous legal doctrine makes its first appearance in Supreme Court Jurisprudence. While the doctrine is not fully realized until almost 20 years later, we see the Supreme Court first contemplate the issue.\n\nNow, [Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U.S. 385 (1920)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/251/385/case.html) was a case where federal agents illegally seized tax records, made copies, and tried to present them as evidence in the prosecution of Silverthorne Lumber Company. Now, long story short, the Supreme Court was not having any of that. A rather famous quote delivered by Oliver, known for his short but scathing opinions, reads: \n\n>In our opinion, such is not the law. It reduces the Fourth Amendment to a form of words. The essence of a provision forbidding the acquisition of evidence in a certain way is that not merely evidence so acquired shall not be used before the Court, but that it shall not be used at all.\n\nHolmes further states:\n\n>Of course, this does not mean that the facts thus obtained become sacred and inaccessible. If knowledge of them is gained from an **independent** source they may be proved like any others, but the **knowledge gained by the Government\'s own wrong cannot be used by it in the way proposed.**\n\nHmmm. Well what do we now have confirmation of that we have known for weeks if not months?\n\n* The political origins of the Steele dossier were known to senior DOJ and FBI officials, but excluded from the FISA applications.\n\n*  Andrew McCabe confirmed that no FISA warrant would have been sought from the FISA Court without the Steele dossier information.\n\nAny almonds activating yet? No? Well, let me continue.\n\nIn 1939, Justice Frankfurter delivered the opinion of the Supreme court in the case [Nardone v. United States, \n308 U.S. 338 (1939)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/308/338/case.html) which finally gave the legal doctrine we know today its name. Below is a quick excerpt that may pique your interest in how this applies to the Trump sham investigation into ""collusion"" with the Russians:\n\n>The burden is, of course, on the accused in the first instance to prove to the trial court\'s satisfaction that wiretapping was unlawfully employed. Once that is established -- as was plainly done here -- the trial judge must give opportunity, however closely confined, to the accused to prove that a substantial portion of the case against him was a fruit of the poisonous tree. This leaves ample opportunity to the Government to convince the trial court that its proof had an independent origin.\n\nGetting there yet? What else do we now have confirmation of? \n\n* The Steele dossier formed an essential part of the intial and all three renewal FISA applications against Carter Page.\n\nWait, wait, wait. So the basis of the FISA applications that were carried out during the end of the Obama administration were based on this? \n\nOn January 11, 2017, The Guardian reported that the FBI initially applied for a FISA warrant in June 2016, requesting to ""monitor four members of the Trump team suspected of irregular contacts with Russian officials."" **This initial request was denied.** \n\nA source told The Guardian that the FBI then submitted a more narrowly focused request in October, ""but that has not been confirmed, and it is not clear whether any warrant led to a full investigation."" \n\nSo, now we know ""more narrowly focused"" just means that the Dossier was used as the basis for the approved FISA applications. The same dossier that was misrepresented to the FISA Court Judge, despite the FBI and DOJ knowing the political basis of the dossier itself. \n\nBut, but, muhhh people involved said everything was done appropriately and there was no foul play going on. \n\nWhat happened to Comey? What recently happened to McCabe? What is about to happen to the **COUNTLESS** other FBI and DOJ officials involved in this debacle that will be revealed soon by the Inspector General, Horowitz?\n\nI\'ll give you a hint. Heads will roll. Didn\'t you find it strange that [Mueller decided to postpone Mike Flynn\'s sentencing?](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/31/politics/robert-mueller-michael-flynn/index.html)\n\nI certainly did, and now I think it is more clear why. \n\nMueller knows he\'s fucked. His whole special counsel investigation was based on these ""illegal"" FISA warrants, that were illegally presented to the FISA court despite the FBI\'s and DOJ\'s knowledge of its origin. McCabe was asked explicitly by Congress if he knew this and he testified that he didn\'t remember. Also of note, the insurance policy that was mentioned in a metting held in his office involving the disgraced FBI agent **THAT SERVED ON MUELLER\'S SPECIAL COUNSEL** Peter Strozk. \n\nAlso of note:\n\n* Six of the 15 lawyers have not made campaign contributions to any political campaigns at the federal level.\n\n* Among the lawyers who did make contributions, a total of $62,043 went to Democrats and $2,750 to Republicans, according to the special counsel‚Äôs office.\n\n* In terms of Clinton specifically, election filings indicate that three lawyers gave her 2016 presidential campaign a total of $700; and three gave a total of $18,100 to either her 2016 campaign or her 2008 run for the presidential nomination.\n\nThis is the beginning of the end of the Mueller Investigation. Take it to the bank, as Nancy Pelosi would say.\n\nAny evidence of wrongdoing, these sham indictments with no relation to ""Russian Collusion"" will all go away. The Supreme Court still stands by their support of Constitutional Fourth Amendment rights. This will not go over well. There is already extreme disfavor for special counsels in general, due to their wide ranging latitude in effectively serving as an unchecked fourth branch of government that circumvents the judiciary. Severe doubts have been raised in past Supreme Court Jurisprudence about the validity of the constitutionality of such counsels. This certainly will be a blow in future cases with how the Supreme Court looks to be composed at this moment, and into the future.\n\nThis level of bias, mixed with a seemingly unlimited power of the special counsel, has been a problem for decades. This issue is now the hot talking point of the year. We know Trump has known all of this information since at least [March 4^th, 2017](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/837989835818287106). He knew, and waited this long for vindication.\n\n Well guess what REEEEEEEEEEEEsisters? Vindication is here. Your day of reckoning is upon you. Mueller will not be able to effectively stage a coup on our legitimately elected president. The democrats are the only party that we have proof of that colluded with foreign agents to try and influence the election. \n\nThis [suprisingly based article](http://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/351495-it-looks-like-obama-did-spy-on-trump-just-as-he-did-to-me) from September of 2017 sheds some more insight onto the scope of these abuses:\n\n>Officials involved in the surveillance and unmasking of U.S. citizens have said their actions were legal and not politically motivated. And there are certainly legitimate areas of inquiry to be made by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. But look at the patterns. It seems that government monitoring of journalists, members of Congress and political enemies ‚Äî under multiple administrations ‚Äî has become more common than anyone would have imagined two decades ago. So has the unmasking of sensitive and highly protected names by political officials.\n\nThe corruption has been identified. The corruption will be weeded out. Look for the Inspector General to be dropping names of more agents within the FBI and DOJ officials involved in this scandal. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n'",7utdko

None of this has or will ever happen with Trump as the President. \n\n\n\n#Deconstructing Narratives \n\n\n\n#[*^This ^bogus ^article ^by ^HuffPo*](https://archive.is/b4O08) \n\n\n\n#^Mainly ^what\'s ^up ^with ^this ^article: \n\n\n\n> the Trump administration revoked a grant to Life After Hate, a group that works to de-radicalize neo-Nazis..... The Department of Homeland Security had awarded the group $400,000 as part of its Countering Violent Extremism program **in January, just days before former President Barack Obama left office**. \n\n\n\nOkay, so they were given money to investigate something. Usually the DOH doesn\'t do that, ever since 9/11, the DOH usually doesn\'t outsource their materials, **especially pertaining to Counterterrorism**, this is a very unusual move. \n\n\n\n> including Katharine Gorka, a controversial national security analyst known for her **anti-Muslim rhetoric** \n\n\n\nOkay, even if this *did* happen, **Radical Islamic Terrorism** is *way* more of a threat than White Supremacy has been in recent years, this is completely justified. I\'m surprised the DOH even outsourced to this group anyway. \n\n\n\n> what the president has described as ‚Äúradical Islamic terrorism.‚Äù \n\n\n\n\nThey won\'t even call it for what it is. \n\n\n\nRadical. Islamic. Terrorism. It\'s real, it\'s growing, and it\'s dangerous. We shouldn\'t be afraid to call it for what it is. \n\n\n\n> Gorka told Selim and Gersten she didn‚Äôt agree with the Obama administration‚Äôs approach to countering violent extremism \n\n\n\nThis comment was completely based on assumption with no reference to said interview. \n\n\n\n> Gorka told Selim and Gersten she didn‚Äôt agree with the Obama administration‚Äôs approach to countering violent extremism \n\n\n\nAlso assumption, the article is trying to associate her with an intent to deny that White Extremism is extremism. It\'s a clear projection tactic by the article. \n\n\n\n> The Trump administration has repeatedly criticized the previous administration for avoiding terms like ‚Äúradical Islam‚Äù  \n\n\n\nThis is true. \n\n\n\n> ‚ÄúKatharine Gorka has been integral in helping the Department broaden efforts to focus on all forms of extremism. Her work includes efforts to address everything from global jihadists threats to domestic terrorists,‚Äù  \n\n\n\nGood, that means if she identifies ridiculous or unnecessary funding, she should fix it. That\'s her job. \n\n\n\n> mainstream national security experts are either unfamiliar with or critical of their work \n\n\n\nWell of course they would be. They\'re Trump aids, everyone would be critical of their work. The article is trying to put Media ""experts"" over government officials. \n\n\n\n> the office of then-DHS Secretary John Kelly ordered a full review of the Countering Violent Extremism program. Kelly‚Äôs office wanted to re-vet the groups receiving a portion of the $10 million Congress had appropriated for the program \n\n\n\nGood. We\'ve had *way* more threats of Radical Islam than we\'ve had of White Nationalism. \n\n\n\n> even though DHS had already publicly announced the grant recipients \n\n\n\nThe DHS would announce this with the GPO first. These public reviews could take weeks to process. The fact that the article doesn\'t reference to the GPO only attributes to my doubt of the article\'s truthful integrity. \n\n\n\n> Staffers in the Countering Violent Extremism program have long pushed for it to address threats from domestic terrorists, including white supremacists \n\n\n\nI understand this. I support this, but as far as I\'m concerned, White Nationalism isn\'t invading Baghdad right now and stealing a shit ton of oil. Palestinian Nationalism poses much more of an international threat. **Domestic efforts are already conducted by the FBI, so funding to an external source at this point would be unnecessary**. \n\n\n\n> But when DHS published a new list of award recipients on June 23, there was no mention of Life After Hate. \n\n\n\nHowever, the [published report](https://archive.is/Sw1Vo) **did** include [a shit ton of funding to cops](https://i.imgur.com/FWhULyg.png) and other Counter-Terrorist organisations on a domestic level, thus making obsolete any further funds to this ""Life After Hate"" group. The previous funds were allocated unusually to that group by the Obama Administration, further and much better efforts can be directed toward more efficient government programs, rather than private programs. \n\n\n\n> DHS also revoked funding from the Muslim Public Affairs Council, an American Muslim advocacy organization that was told in January it would receive a $393,800 grant to create community resource centers throughout the country. \n\n\n\nI\'m not sure what to say about this but no source is given. \n\n\n\n> After publishing its new list of grantees, DHS told Muslim Public Affairs Council that it was now prioritizing organizations that worked with law enforcement. The money that was initially set aside for community-based groups like Muslim Public Affairs Council and Life After Hate will now go to several law enforcement agencies. \n\n\n\nI can tell, obviously, according to the report, it shows that. What Rudy Giuliani did in 1994 for increased police funding helped clean up the city, imagine how much better our country would be when that happens. So, I support this decision to cut programs that previously went to private Counter-Extremist groups only if the funding goes to Police. I\'m all for this. I don\'t see anything racist or anti-Muslim about this. \n\n\n\n> ‚ÄúIs this really just a front for targeting the Muslim community?‚Äù asked Omar Noureldin, Muslim Public Affairs Council‚Äôs vice president. \n\n\n\n\nLol what the heck, that came out of nowhere. \n\n\n\n> Noureldin is now looking into whether the Trump administration‚Äôs use of the Countering Violent Extremism program‚Äôs funds violates congressional appropriation intent. \n\n\n\nThe Kek it wouldn\'t. Not in a million years would prioritising a government agency over a private one be a violation of Congressional Appropriations. Even the Senate Appropriations Committee would agree on this, hell, even the Democrats would agree on this. \n\n\n\n\n> Less than two months after DHS announced it was pulling funding from Life After Hate, James Alex Fields Jr., a 20-year-old Ohioan, traveled to Charlottesville, Virginia, to join white supremacists armed with long guns, waving Nazi and Confederate flags and protesting the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a local park. \n\n\n\nThe article is trying to make a connection here, where there is no connection. How would fields know about this report? Most people like him are so closed minded, they don\'t even know what\'s happening beyond a 20-yard radius of their front porch. Even if this ""Life After Hate"" program still had its funding, it couldn\'t do shit to stop what happened from happening. \n\n\n\n> Life After Hate was founded by former white supremacists who have renounced the racist ideology and who now help others transition out of hate groups and re-assimilate into society. \n\n\n\nGood. I\'m glad there are programs like this. I really am, I really am happy that some of these KKK scumbags can have their sins washed away. I just don\'t think that funding should go toward them when other government agencies are capable of much more than they are. I do believe, however, they could have used their expertise to inform Government Agencies about what was going on, but the article makes no mention of that. They had 3 days to contact the police and say: ""hey, we worked for you guys until January, we have expertise in combating the KKK and White Extremism, do you need our help?"" The police would be happy to receive their help. \n\n\n\n> The white supremacy movement ‚Äúhas been growing, but it‚Äôs also been shape-shifting,‚Äù Piccolini said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gone from what we would have considered very open neo-Nazis and skinheads and KKK marching, to now people that look like our neighbors, our doctors, our teachers, our mechanics.‚Äù \n\n\n\nThis is false. Those shaved-head freaks don\'t assimilate into our society. We\'ve changed to exclude them, they *deserve* to be excluded because of their Hitler-Worshiping filth. \n\n\n\n\n> a lot of the rhetoric that‚Äôs coming out of the White House today is so similar to what we preached \n\n\n\nAlso false. Trump hasn\'t pandered to them in **any** way. \n\n\n\nJust the fact that somebody with expertise in the field of violent White Extremism would go to the lengths and say that a Republican Candidate is similar to them only baffles me. I wouldn\'t appropriate funding to this guy in a million years if he said that to me. \n\n\n\nThat\'s literally just like saying: ""Hey, would you help me stop the KKK? I think you\'re the KKK, so do you want me to help you stop them? I still think you\'re the KKK and you like them, if you refuse my help, I\'ll be forced to say that you support them. What do you think""? \n\n\n\nNo government agency would support someone who would sell out to the media that easily, either. \n\n\n\n> The president ignored several calls to specifically denounce white supremacists and neo-Nazis \n\n\n\nHe specifically denounced them on multiple different occasions. \n\n\n\n\n> It wasn‚Äôt until Monday, two days after the violent rally, that Trump specifically denounced ‚Äúthe [Ku Klux Klan], neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups.‚Äù \n\n\n\n[Fucking liar](https://archive.is/iO1AF). He denounced it **25 minutes later**. And even then, it took Obama **5 years** to denounce Homophobia. \n\n\n\n\n> Trump‚Äôs hesitancy to disavow white supremacists echoes his practice of repeatedly dodging questions about David Duke \n\n\n\n\nHe hasn\'t dodged questions. When he was asked, he denounced them. Even dating back to 1991. \n\n\n\n\n\n> Trump eventually distanced himself from the infamous white supremacist \n\n\n\nThe use of the word ""eventually"" only proves they\'re lying. He has a **long** history of denouncing David Duke and those White Supremacist scumbags. They are **against** the Constitution. \n\n\n\n> He argued days before the Charlottesville attack that white supremacy is not ‚Äúthe problem‚Äù facing the country. \n\n\n\nHe **never** said that. He was mainly talking about making the Middle East a priority. Gosh they like to put words in people\'s mouths sometimes..... \n\n\n\n> DHS did not directly respond to a questions about why it cut funding for de-radicalizing neo-Nazis, and whether it views white supremacy as an extremist threat. \n\n\n\nOf course they wouldn\'t. They wouldn\'t sell out to the Media only to have their words twisted into an entirely different context. \n\n\n\n\n> Sixteen of the 26 groups that received DHS funding ‚Äúhave applicability to all forms of violent extremism and as such will address the threat of domestic terrorism,‚Äù Franko, the DHS spokeswoman, wrote. \n\n\n\nSee, I told you. :) \n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n#Want to be more informed? \n\n\n\n**Tune in to GOVERNMENT Sources**, not the lying media.

You guessed it - November 2016.\n\n[According to the Southern Poverty Law Centre, (fuck them, but they\'ve done good research into him), Jason Kessler was previously involved with the Occupy Movement and was an ardent Obama supporter through both terms.](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/jason-kessler)\n\nHe only changed his views in November 2016 (top kek), and established his white supremacist group, ""Unity & Security For America"" in January 2017.\n\nKessler organized this rally, in a similar vein to prior free speech rallies to get as many Trump supporters there as possible, and went on to invite several neo-Nazi and KKK groups to smear everyone attending.\n\nThis is right up the alley of Scott Foval and Bob Creamer, Democratic operatives who organized ""bird-dogging"" at Trump rallies last year to smear regular Trump supporters as racist and violent.\n\nJason Kessler should be arrested.\n\nSpez: He also has several prior charges including assault (as recently as this year), obstruction of justice and failure to appear.\n\nSpez2: From u/SethEllis: https://twitter.com/JasonBKessler/status/896388650824384512\n\nAs a result of this tweet, I\'m removing the section about CNN for now as it has come to my attention that it may be a different Jason Kessler. If someone can confirm it was the Kessler in question I will put back the info about CNN.\n\nSpez3: Also removing the part where a ""Jason Kessler"" received money for assisting a Democrat in his Senate run. Same reason as Spez2.\n\nSpez4: u/William-WallaceGhost has posted a video from Lee Stranahan breaking down several instances of this rally that are identical to the lead-up to the Ukrainian coup of 2013, including the Mosquito Torch March, the chants of ""Blood and Soil"", and the demonization of Ukrainian government supporters, orchestrated by Soros, McCain and Graham. [Link](https://youtu.be/ppBXqO6ObQ8)\n\nSpez5: This post is getting brigaded. Look out for posts from users spamming conspiracy theories defending Challenger Nazi.\n\nSpez6: Apparently ZeroHedge is running this story. [Link](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-08-14/report-%E2%80%98unite-right%E2%80%99-organizer-jason-kessler-was-occupy-movement-obama-supporter-8-m)\n\nSpez7: From u/pdotuts: Has Kessler been mentioned in any of the leaked emails?\n\nSpez8: Kessler BTFO by Alex Jones: https://twitter.com/infowars/status/897269114963509249\n\nSpez9: From u/FraudulentNews: [Courtesy of James O\'Keefe, a Tutorial in Bird-Dogging, Featuring Scott Foval and Bob Creamer](https://youtu.be/45QKsgitMCs)\n\nSpez10: From u/lookatmeimwhite: Media outlets were accusing Trump of using the term ""Blood and Soil"" on his trip to Poland (spoiler alert: he never used that term)\n\n[Ex. A](http://archive.is/n7ZE7)\n\n[Ex. B](http://dailycaller.com/2017/07/07/trumps-speech-makes-liberals-oppose-western-civilization/)\n\nUPDATE: So, it looks like my post has hit a fever pitch. Reported by DailyCaller, ZeroHedge, Business Insider and InfoWars.

"Seth Rich FOIA Update: MPD Appeal Denied, Anonymous Requests Can Proceed",MeAndTruthVsYou,1501538924.0,9409,,self.The_Donald,"""In a [prior post](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6lmml9/i_won_a_foia_appeal_in_the_seth_rich_case_and_now/), I mentioned that I won a FOIA Appeal in a records request case against the DC Metropolitan Police Department.   This would have allowed all anonymous requestors to request documents without revealing their identity.    \n\nMPD appealed the appeal decision.  They thought they were going to take me down to china town by claiming that Federal FOIA requires unanonymous requests. I looked up several similar cases and found key differences which undermined their argument.     They said, I didn't have standing to make an appeal in court.  Ha, it was an administrative appeal...not a court appeal.   \n\nAnyway, to make a long story short,  I prevailed in the appeal to the appeal.    So, once again, there is room now for anyone anywhere to anonymous request any non-exempt record  AND appeal a witholding decision AND appeal an agency appeal.     (Incidentally, I argued that DC agencies do not have any legal basis to file an appeal since the statute does not carve out this possibility.  I still think I'm right about that but since I won my case, no need to get too huffy puffy about it.)  \n\nHere is the ruling:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/IUu4p""",6qrum8

FCC*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications_Inc._v._FCC_(2014) prevents FCC from enforcing Open Internet Rules unless it *also* enforces Title II (big gov\'t comes in and literally makes the internet its utility) <<wtf,why??? fun fact **the two judges who fucked open-internet were appointed by clinton**, the third dissenter was reagan\n\n- 2015 Net Neutrality (pushed by Obama) = Open Internet Rules (renamed to Bright Line) (good) + Title II Utility Classification (BAD)\n\n- 2017 Net Neutrality Repeal = FTC Regulations (good) + no Title II (good) + no Open Internet Rules (bad) \'(\n\n**The reason Obama\'s 2015 Net Neutrality is bad** isn\'t because it includes the Open Internet Rules (created in 2005), but because it includes the Title II Utility Classification of the internet. AND- get this- the Open Internet Rules are only included *provisionally*, UNDER Title II. This basically says ""hey all ur free speech is only allowed if big gov\'t gets to turn the internet into its utility"". Umm what? 2015 Net Neutrality was advertised as being equal to the Open Internet Rules, but Open Internet had already been an FCC policy since 2005. Obama pressured the FCC to repackage the 2010 Open Internet Order under a Title II Utility Classification of the internet. This is what we oppose. \n\n# Everyone here agrees that ISPs should not throttle/paywall/censor/restrict our content. Period. End of story. ISPs are notoriously shady, but [here are some reassurances the FCC has given us:](https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1122/DOC-347927A1.pdf)\n\n# FTC Privacy Regulation, sec.177 ***aka MARK SUCKERSPERG CAN\'T STEAL YOUR PRIVATE RARE PEPE FETISH PORN COLLECTION:*** \n\n>  Restoring FTC [Federal Trade Commission] jurisdiction over ISPs will enable the FTC to apply its extensive privacy and data security expertise to provide the uniform online privacy protections that consumers expect and deserve.^651\n\n# *Direct quote from the homies: No throttling.* [FCC release, p.83](https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1122/DOC-347927A1.pdf)\n\n> 142.  Many of the largest ISPs (Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, Cox, Frontier, etc.) have committed in this proceeding **not to block or throttle legal content**.^507 These **commitments can be enforced** by the FTC  under Section 5, protecting consumers without imposing public-utility regulation on ISPs.^508\n\n\n# b-but im an ISP I don\'t wanna be transparent I just wanna bait-and-switch my customers while they watch **intergalactic bdsm porn** SORRY HUNNY U GETTN REGULATED (FCC release p.82):\n\n>  The FTC‚Äôs unfair-and-deceptive-practices authority ‚Äúprohibits companies from selling consumers one product or service but providing them something different,‚Äù which makes voluntary commitments enforceable.^502 The FTC also requires the ‚Äúdisclos[ur]e [of] material information if not disclosing it would mislead the consumer,‚Äù so if an ISP ‚Äúfailed to disclose blocking, throttling, or other practices that would matter to a reasonable consumer, the FTC‚Äôs deception authority would apply.‚Äù^503\n\n# Conspiracy theorists put down your pitch-forks, ISPs cannot conspire. (FCC invokes Sherman Act Antitrust Laws, Section 144, p.85, FCC release)\n\n> 144. Section 1 of the Sherman Act bars contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, making anticompetitive arrangements illegal.  If ISPs reached agreements to unfairly block, throttle, or discriminate against Internet conduct or applications, these agreements would be per seillegal under the antitrust laws.^518\n\n# ***UNLIMITED NETFLIXXX, [UNCENSORED EDITION] ***\n\n>  If an ISP that also sells video services degrades the speed or quality of competing ‚ÄúOver the Top‚Äù video services (such as Netflix),^526 that conduct could be challenged as anticompetitive foreclosure.  \n\n# Obama & The Globalist Friendship Squad attempted to create a ~~communist takeover~~ safe space on the internet.\n\n> 161. We also conclude that the Commission should have been cautioned against reclassifying broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service in 2015 because doing so involved ‚Äúlaying claim to **extravagant statutory power over the national economy** ...""\n\n\n# AT&T got uppity, tried to slide a fat & nasty nude into America\'s DMs and the FCC said ***behave yourself hunny***. FCC now reserves the right to return to Title II (Obama Net Neutrality) regulations if ISP fuckers get uppity. \n\n> 176.We also reject AT&T‚Äôs assertion that the Commission should conditionally forbear from all Title II regulations as a preventive measure to address the contingency that a future Commission might seek to reinstate the Title II Order.^647  Although AT&T explains that ‚Äúconditional forbearance would provide an extra level of **insurance against the contingency that a future, politically motivated Commission might try to reinstate a ‚Äòcommon carrier‚Äô classification [2015 Net Neutrality Regulations]**,‚Äù^648 we see no need to address the complicated question of prophylactic forbearance and find **such extraordinary measures [are] unnecessary.**\n \n# And finally, the cherry-on-top.\n\n> Should the hypothetical harms that proponents of Title II imagine eventually come to pass, application of the antitrust laws would address those harms.\n\n#TLDR\n\n- Regulatory ~~rollback~~ throwback to 90\'s.\n\n- FCC claims the 2015 Regulations gave the government ""extravagant statutory power over the national economy"". * ***laughs in Kenyan*** *\n\n- Regulatory oversight of the ISP now includes the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) as it was in the 1990\'s. Unlike the FCC, they can fuck Comcast for being a monopoly (which they are allowed to be if they\'re a utility).\n\n- FCC is enforcing against throttling, censorship, restriction, etc. by invoking consumer protection and anti-trust laws (via FTC).\n\n- If ISPs collectively conspire to paywall a content-provider, they are subject to FTC anti-trust penetration.\n\n- FCC repeatedly acknowledges that its new policy is deliberately business-friendly in hopes to increase competition in the market so that Comcast isn\'t the only fucking one. FCC acknowledges that potential abuse of this friendliness will result in stricter policy. \n\n- America has some of the shittiest internet in the world because our infrastructure is antiquated and fiber-optic trenching projects keep getting killed. Title-II strangles investments, but this repeal attracts it. Better infrastructure means faster speeds and cheaper service. **#Pray4FiberOptic**\n\n- Remember all the Congressmen who wanted to sell out our personal information earlier this year? This FCC repeal will block that, because of FTC consumer privacy protection regulations don\'t allow it.\n\n\n# **How this may negatively affect you:** \n\nThe major loophole lies here:\n\n>Many of the largest ISPs have **committed** to not to block or throttle legal content.^507 These commitments **can** be enforced by the FTC...\n\nFTC prevents throtting/blocking/etc because that\'s what ISPs are advertising, and they must be held accountable. If multiple ISPs each individually stop advertising it, it\'s not *immediately* clear that the FTC can hold them all accountable to it. However, if the ISPs collude to collectively enact abusive policies, then the FTC can fuck them up. Further, if an ISP paywalls websites, they must explicitly notify consumers. **If customers have no alternative ISP and are forced to obey their one ISP\'s abusive policies, then the FTC can declare them a monopoly.** That would whip up a shitstorm for the ISP, but it could still happen.\n\nLater in the report the FCC admits that they have to eliminate the Open Internet Rules, which is bad for us. The FCC was forced to do this because of the two **Democrat** judges in the D.C. Circuit who presided over *Verizon v. FCC* and ruled that the FCC is no longer allowed to enforce open-internet **unless they force the ISPs to become Title II Utilities.**\n\n**The Democrat judges admitted that they were**\n\n> **...not to assess the wisdom of the Open Internet Order regulations**, but rather to determine whether the Commission has demonstrated that the regulations fall within the scope of its statutory grant of authority.""\n\nThese two judges were appointed by Bill Clinton. Almost sounds like he paid them a visit on the tarmac. \n\n# [FCC Bright-Line / Open Internet Rules](http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0312/FCC-15-24A1.pdf)\n\n- No Blocking\n\n- No Throttling\n\n- No Paid-Prioritization \n\nThe FCC Bright Line Rules are replaced with FTC regulations:\n\n- No monopolies. (lookin at you comcast)\n\n- No collusion. (still lookin at you)\n\n- No consumer abuse \n\n- No unfair business practice. (holy fuck comcast)\n\n\n**The report clarifies that the repeal of FCC Bright Line does not inhibit the FTC from enforcing an open internet, and regulation enforcement is delegated to the FTC heretofore. (FTC has a good record protecting consumers).**\n\n> In the unlikely event that ISPs engage in conduct that **harms Internet openness**, despite the paucity of evidence of such incidents, we find that utility-style regulation is unnecessary to address such conduct.  Other legal regimes‚Äîparticularly antitrust law and the FTC‚Äôs authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act to prohibit unfair and deceptive practices‚Äîprovide protection for consumers.\n\nThe FCC admits that this has the potential to become a problem. They claim it is highly unlikely because the FTC can come in and penetrate ISPs who act as monopolies. Plus, content providers (Google, Amazon, etc.) have an obscenely higher market capitalization than ISP\'s (Google alone has higher market cap than all ISP\'s combined), and that they can easily pressure ISPs to obey. \n\nFor example:\n\n- Comcast tries to throttle Netflix. \n\n- Netflix says fuck you we won\'t serve any of your Comcast kind here. \n\n- Comcast customers can\'t watch Stranger Things.\n\n- Comcast customers screech autistically.\n\n-  Everyone (who can) leaves Comcast.\n\n- If nobody can leave Comcast, the FTC can declare Comcast a monopoly and bust their nuts. This nut busting can legally bind Comcast to their past promises of Open Internet, since there are no competitors keeping them incheck.  \n\nThus the FCC concludes it is unlikely that ISPs will paywall their content providers because content-providers will easily prevent them from doing it. FCC asserts that monopolies like Comcast will be combated with FTC anti-monopoly regulation, increased competition, and more ISP choices for customers that will drive price down and quality up. FCC will address individual ISP violations case by case if/when they arise. \n\n>141. Consumer Protection.  The FTC has broad authority to protect consumers from ‚Äúunfair or deceptive acts or practices.‚Äù^495\n\n**I can\'t imagine anything more unfair than Comcast monopolizing your internet.**\n\n**Timeline Review**\n\n- [2005 Open Internet](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-151A1.pdf) announced as FCC policy by the then Republican chairman.\n\n- [2010 Open Internet Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States#FCC_Open_Internet_Order_.282010.29) = Open Internet Rules (aka Bright Line) **(good)**\n\n- [2014 *Verizon v. FCC*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications_Inc._v._FCC_(2014) D.C. Circuit of Appeals (aka the swamp) prevents FCC from enforcing Open Internet Rules unless it *also* enforces Title II (big gov\'t comes in and literally makes the internet its utility) <<wtf,why??? Fun Fact: these two judges who fucked the internet were appointed by Clinton (I wonder if they had a tarmac meeting to talk about their kids\' internet usage). The third judge who tried to stop it was a Reagan man. \n\n- 2015 Net Neutrality (pushed by Obama) = Open Internet Rules (renamed to Bright Line) (good) + Title II Utility Classification **(BAD)**\n\n- 2017 Net Neutrality Repeal = FTC Regulations (good) + no Title II (good) + no Open Internet Rules  :\'(\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe FCC couldn\'t have done any more for Open-Internet, thanks to Bill Clinton\'s judges in the D.C. Circuit strangling the shit out of the FCC\'s jurisdiction. They said ""make the internet a utility or end Open-Internet"". Instead of caving in to either of those demands, the FCC did a brilliant end-run around the judges by bringing the FTC in to do what the FCC no longer can. This will prevent blocking and throttling, and it\'ll be the first time they\'ve attacked ISP monopolization (Comcast)! Unfortunately, the possibility still exists that paid-prioritization (bundling internet packages by speed) will emerge in the future, especially if the FTC fails to crack down on monopolies like Comcast, and/or if the markets fail to produce enough competitors to the existing ISPs. Keep your eyes open and stay vigilant.\n\n*Merry Christmas!*\n\n\n'",7fq8uw

"On this day, 242 years ago in Philadelphia, 56 politicians with guts voted in favor of their own death warrant.",Attacitus,1530529117.0,9230,AMERICA FIRST,self.The_Donald,"'By June 1776, the British had taken over Boston, attempted to confiscate the arms of the local militias (leading to Paul Revere\'s Ride and the Battles of Lexington and Concord). After their defeats at Lexington & Concord, the British determined to pacify Boston by force at the Battle of Bunker Hill. While the British prevailed, 400 Patriot volunteers took 1,000 British regulars with them. \n\nThe last Olive Branch Petition to the King had been returned from London and read aloud to the Congress by President John Hancock. The King had resolved to ignore them and also brand them traitors; all who did not immediately capitulate and surrender would face death. \n\nThe British were regrouping after a temporary withdraw from Boston while sending fleets and German mercenaries up the Hudson to New York and up the Delaware to Philadelphia. The only thing standing between the Continental Congress and total British victory were the river defensese in Delaware. \n\nOn June 7th, 1776, Mr. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia proposed a Declaration of Independence. After a lengthy debate over several days led by John Adams, a 20 day recess was called to allow delegations to seek instructions from their constituent assemblies. As British marched into New York, the Provincial Assembly was forced to flee and the New York delegation was put in a precarious position: obey last instructions and vote against or vote rogue and invite the British to burn the city to the ground. The Continental Congress re-convened on July 2nd and unanimously declared independence - with New York abstaining to prevent the British sack of the city. \n\nTwo days later the Congress would agree on the very wording of the Declaration, drafted by Thomas Jefferson but heavily edited by the Continental Congress as a whole. \n\nAt this point in time the war could have very easily been lost and there were no guarantees that even the politicians leading the effort would escape British judgement. This vote marked these men for death and they would spend the better part of the next month sneaking in and out of the city to sign the Declaration.\n\n>""I am apt to believe that July 2nd will be celebrated, by succeeding Generations, as the great anniversary Festival. It ought to be commemorated, as the Day of Deliverance by solemn Acts of Devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more.-- **John Adams, to his wife Abigail Adams, July 2nd, 1776.**'",8vhqog

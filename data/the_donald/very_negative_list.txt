"I'd like to be critical of Trump, all you fuckers, all the memes.\n\nBut honestly, besides the healthcare comments and my own beliefs about how if my neighbour gets sick that my taxes that I paid for the betterment of my civilised nation should heal them back to full health...and even writing that in comments and getting upvoted for it here lol there is NOTHING that I can say that is bad about Trump or this subreddit.\n\nThe media though, even in the UK is saying RUSSIA PAID FACEBOOK TO ADVERTISE TRUMP TO WIN THE PRESIDENCY, OMFG HOW BAD IS THAT? I'm reading this shit on the BBC thinking 'isnt Obama more of a communist though than Trump, like by far, trying to get a health system like ours amongst a people that are fundamentally against this and have a deeper, pioneer outlook', basically what is happening is that the BBC are using anti-Russian (anti-communist) ideology of our glorious past in the UK as the rulers of the free world, like how communism is so bad, and then trying to equate that in our minds to Trump. \n\nRealistically, how the fuck does that make any sense?\n\nAND NOW, WE REALISE WHAT 'FAKE MEDIA' is, sources we used to trust. Sources we the people of the UK fund as well pushes fake propaganda against our greatest ally and ultimately our greatest child that we created who has just grown up more than we could ever think they have.\n\nAt the same time, they push pro-EU shit, like after the EU leave vote we were supposed to be in such a worse situation than we already are. If you take into consideration the rest of the population in the UK who are not 'make the UK great again', minded...recent immigrants who have immigrated into working class areas and thought 'life is shit here', which this then passed down to their children has second generation immigrant brits brought up here due to failing immigration policies and they commit terrorist attacks such as Lee Rigby if anybody else remembers and then the media tries to hide the facts about our very society we live in.\n\nWe're the nation that cut the head off one of our kings and invented democracy in its modern form, magna carta. Looking over the pond America is doing it better now and we need to rise up and compete with empowering people not as in being looked after by the state but not being afraid to say we're British and proud and it's fucking disgusting that the media is portraying the opposite to what WE VOTED FOR, the vast majority of people who are not from recent immigrant families and suffered from these failing immigration policies the very rulers above us set, these people AS A VAST MAJORITY VOTED LEAVE FOR THESE REASONS!!!\n\nAmericans just voted the notion of that into the white house, because they're proud Americans. \n\nFucking THANK YOU AMERICA!!! Lead the way, as we step down from leading the way, because our politicians are ALL IN THE EUROPEAN DICK SUCKING NOT PROUD TO BE BRITISH AND HAND AWAY OUR SOVEREIGNTY WEAKNESS, not representing the will of the people adequately, TRUMP UNDERSTANDS US MORE THAN OUR MEDIA LOL it's true. \n\nThank fuck America exists. Thank you for Trump, FLY YOUR FLAGS AMERICANS PROUDLY, if we do that now these days it's racist to be proud to be British and shit. "
"Feminists will never stand up for the oppressed muslim women, they're busy bitching about a nonexistent wage gap that is impossible under the law."
"I didn't know these true feminists still existed! I thought they went extinct due to 3rd wave feminism and brainwashing from the MSM. "
"because that would mean they would have to seriously reconsider their entire perspective of the world.  it's much easier to be a raging cunt "
" ...because they don't care. Modern feminists are primarily unattractive undesirables angry at men and the pretty girls who got all the attention in high school and college. They're basically female neckbeards."
'Because fighting "manspreading" is easier than fighting Islam. Would you rather fight polite western men who are eager to give in to your every whim or foreign savages that are literally willing to blow themselves up?'

"What about black people, they rape you the most. Oh i'm sorry am i being racist right now? "
"This right here, for the life of me I can't understand why 'feminists' don't vocalize more about this than significantly smaller scale issues here in the states. I'm on board with most of the domestic issues that feminism promotes. I'd even identify as a feminist if asked, no problem with that. But the things listed in this picture are life-altering on a WAY bigger scale, both in terms of #s and in terms of dangers/actual problems. I get that it might be hard for us here in the US to rally around these issues since it's not like we can force every radical Muslim overseas fo adhere to basic fucking human rights when it comes to women and girls. But god damn, there are 1000 viral discussions, trends and national / social conversations for domestic feminist issues for every 1 fucking discussion / trend / whatever about the issues women face in the middle east.\n\nMost likely reason is the stupid far left paradox 'oh can't criticize religions (that aren't Catholicism)  even if they do subjugate women at best and rape them at worst'."
"The sooner we sort this religion out the better it will be for all of us, by sort it out I mean ban it completely in every single western country across the world that's how you deal with Islam remove it and ban it."
'**WOMAN SUFFRAGE**     \n  It is evident that the cause of female suffrage is rapidly gaining in strength and popularity throughout the country.  Many of the ablest politicians and the most influential papers of the country have become outspoken in its behalf, and the efforts for its accomplishment have gained greater dignity, both from the character of those engaged and the manner in which they advocate it.    \n  With the granting of the ballot to the negro, the revolution in the elective franchise has but begun.  It has seemed to us all the time, that, conceding the propriety of negro suffrage, of which we had no doubt, there could be no argument made against the right of women to vote.  The whole question is simply between restricted and universal suffrage.  Either it was right for the class who possessed the ballot to restrict it to themselves, at their own will, or they have no right to deprive any of their fellow citizens of it.  The fact is, that there is no reason qualifying a white man for voting that does not equally apply to the negro and qualify him for the same act; and there is no reason qualifying either a white or negro man for voting that does not also equally qualify the white or negro women for voting.  The door that was opened to let in the negro can not be shut against woman.  When the principle became established that every person interested in the government was entitled to a share in its administration, this began to be a truly Democratic government, and there is no probability that the extension of the suffrage will stop short of including citizens of both sexes.    \n  The opposition is not so great to female suffrage now as it was to negro suffrage only a few years ago.  It will be astonishing when the question is voted on to see how little real opposition there is to it.  The strongest point now made against it is, that the most of women do not care to exercise the franchise--it cannot be called an argument; indeed, we do not know of any argument against female suffrage; all the objections being mere assertions, and most of them very vague ones, too.  The great objection to negro suffrage need to be, "Do you want your daughter to marry a negro?"  But that will not answer for this new issue.  How it would sound to ask, "Do you want your daughter to marry a--woman?"      \n  Since the above was in type, we learn that the House of Representatives of Dakota has passed a bill conferring on woman the elective franchise and eligibility to office, which is considered certain of passing the Senate and becoming the law of the Territory.      \n-The Rochester (MN) Post; January 2, 1869'
"I have never supported the religious sanctioned abuses of Islam and I consider myself a feminist.  I have seen some progress among some American Islam groups but as far as I'm concerned, any religion that forces a hijab on it's female groups is barbaric and the whole world should stand against it.  I stand for equal pay for equal work, access to reproductive healthcare and against ANY religious abuses  of women.  I'm not religious and will stand for my rights even sometimes against my fellow women on their political platforms.  Can't stand Hillary was a Bernie supporter."
'Yessss I\'m an old school feminist... women are not "better" than men... we are equal, that is all I believe in.

I see so many Hispanic people in Charlotte it\'s ridiculous. Nobody cares if you\'re Hispanic. Very few people in the South are actually racist in my experience. Many don\'t like people coming into their country and taking construction jobs and other middle class jobs when they didn\'t come into the country legally, and many also dislike the culture of gang-banging and drug dealing. But I\'ve met very few people that straight up dislike people based on skin color. Why is it that for the left, they can\'t seem to separate between skin color and culture? You can dislike certain elements of a culture without hating people because they\'re brown. IE: selling drugs and shooting people is bad, leaving your children and living off of welfare is bad. These issues are prominent problems within the illegal immigrant and African American communities. Because they have these problems and we want to solve them, WE\'RE the racists. Like how on Tucker Carlson I was watching and this black guy was saying how Trump was a racist for saying that inner cities have issues and that they have nothing to lose by trying to vote for a Republican. Like, are you denying that they\'re bad? Or are you denying that they\'ve gotten worse under democratic rule? Cuz you can\'t have both.'

'It was the stupidest thing to stand on.  This was a dead horse.  MSM now has two weeks of shit to talk about.'
'The NFL was once a pretty great place. It wasn\'t a highly polished direct marketing product like it is now. Players were average guys that worked real jobs in the off-season. \n\nWhile players now are arguably overpaid compared to historical norms, the risk has also never been higher. Constantly getting tackled by 300 lb 6\'5" lineman fucks up your brain along with chronic ligament injuries. \n\nDefensive players back then weren\'t all giants. If they were big they were probably slow. Now you have 300 lb d-lineman running the 40 like running backs did 30 years ago. That and the introduction in the 1980\'s of the Miami Hurricane style of football which was a potent mix of braggadocio and \'tackle high\' pretty much killed the NFL as we know it. \n\nToday the average NFL injured roster often numbers in the dozens. There are zero teams that can last a full season anymore without at least 2-3 key starters being out for most of the season. You wonder why smashmouth players like Mike Ditka are still around and didn\'t seem to receive too much brain damage is because the proper way to tackle was still used then. Fit, wrap, pull. Not jump and spear them in the chin with your helmet. \n\nAll of that and the marketing bullshit today makes me pass. I have better things to do on Sunday than sit on the couch eating Cheetos wearing a polyester fake jersey while swearing at the TV. Remember when NFL coaches used to wear suit and ties? The NFL mandates coaches can only wear that once per year. None of them do anymore. They would rather have schleps like Bellichik wearing dumpy cut off hoodies because it has a logo on it. Think about that. '
'If this was a conservative that attacked a liberal politician the news media circus would be epic. So far, no outrage, and mostly no coverage.'

'>The senator joins a growing list of lawmakers in both parties who have been attacked or threatened with violence this year. Congressional security officials have investigated thousands of general or specific threats against Democratic and Republican lawmakers. \n\n1. This summer, Scalise was almost murdered along with the rest of the republican baseball team including Rand Paul. \n\n2. Rand then suffered five broken ribs and bruised lungs on Friday. \n\n3. Freaky Wilson missed some votes due to "threats" after criticizing Trump. \n\nYes, Washington Compost, these are all equivalent and show targeting of both parties. Fucking decent article until the spin at the end. '
'Since this was a political attack, it should be labeled as a terrorist attack.\n\n\nThank you Democrats normalizing political violence and negative reaction to a political loss.'
'> The senator joins a growing list of lawmakers in both parties who have been attacked or threatened with violence this year.\n\n\n...\n\n> More recently, Rep. Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.) skipped several days of votes after threats were made against her after she sparred with Trump over the treatment of the widow of a U.S. soldier killed in Niger.\n\n\nSo our guys get shot and severely beaten and a Democrat get a few threats (which I\'m confident *many* Republicans have also received) and suddenly you expect me to say "Oh. I guess both parties are being attacked." Fuck you. If a few threats are the best the Washington Post can hoist up to show that the Democrats are experiencing stuff, you know there\'s nothing else. Each and everyday I grow to be more disgusted at our media and at how the left is acting. Absolutely disgusting.'
"Here is the modus operandi of lefties: they agitate, they rabble rouse, they bear false witness.\n\nIf they fail to meet their objectives; they resort to violence.\n\nIf the violence fails, they flip the narrative and call themselves the *victims*. They love to be a 'martyr' for the 'cause'.\n\nIf the violence succeeds,, they seize power and their rule is maintained by more violence."
"Sounds like grievous bodily harm; maybe attempted murder. Rand is NOT a young man, after all. Wounds like this take much longer to heal on an older body. Probably mildly concussed, which is serious enough. Let me tell you. I've been in a few scrapes. Broken ribs; for about 3 weeks you gingerly slide into and out of bed trying to imitate a straight plank of wood. As soon as you bend...sharp stabbing pain.\n\nAnd so the basher' got money?? Sweet. Put a caveat on his house. A group from the Centipede Army should pay him a PR visit. We will NOT tolerate our people being ambushed and bashed. Rand will need COMPENSATION."
'It says something that since Republicans took control the number of attacks by Democrats has increased significantly. I believe it demonstrates how violent liberals are in general, as well as how easily they choose to become so. As we see groups like Antifa and BLM start to replace the KKK as the new militant arm of the Democrats, we also see the violence escalate against the right.

'The Tolerant Left at it again I see. \n\nI‚Äôm very much a centrist and my vote could go either way in any given election based on who is running on what platform. \n\nAs 2015 wore on and the election cycle continued, I became increasingly distanced from the left. It started with the Occupy shenanigans, then BLM/everyone is racist bullshit, grew stronger with mainstream media reporting in an incredibly biased manner, and has only compounded with every new step Leftists take. \n\nThe final nail in the coffin was when they called conservatives and Trump fascists yet they were the ones trying to silence and disrupt free speech with violence and hate. \n\nI can‚Äôt see myself leaning anywhere near the left during the next election cycle....or ever again, until they come back from the extreme left and act like adults. What I‚Äôve observed since Nov 2016 has boiled down to one big ridiculous temper tantrum. When I saw peaceful rallies being attacked by leftists hurling objects and bloodying people who simply had a different viewpoint, it became clear who the fascists really were. It became clear who the intolerant party was. \n\nWe should all be ready for 2020. The left will be very busy all the way up until then, and will try to continue to scare people into not supporting Trump. We need everyone that didn‚Äôt come out last election cycle to come out and not be afraid to do so. I suspect the tolerant left will be in full force to vote as well as intimidate and disrupt less extreme voters. \n\nMy real curiosity is who they are going to put up for election....surely they wouldn‚Äôt try Hilary again. I called that one before she ever got the nomination. Hilary couldn‚Äôt defeat Trump but she could have defeated most of the other possible candidates. Sanders was the only one that had a real shot at beating Trump, and only because Millennials and Gen Zee wanted free stuff. \n\nOk I m ow that wasn‚Äôt really on topic, just my thoughts as a relatively new user to this subreddit and a centrist who is leaning very hard to the right. In fact you could say that I‚Äôve finally stepped right of center. \n'

'**Let\'s think about this logically for a minute**. They can\'t ban guns without a constitutional amendment, and that\'s not going to happen, so that can\'t be the real goal. So what is the goal?\n\nThe Democrats and media were pushing DACA **hard** for weeks. It was their big issue and then they suddenly stopped talking about it. So why does Trump keep mentioning it again on Twitter?\n\nDACA was being framed as the new left/right division issue. The "you can\'t vote for those guys because". What was Trump\'s play? He indicated that he was not entirely opposed to negotiating on DACA, and may even support it himself for the children. That can\'t happen because they don\'t actually want to achieve anything, and they certainly don\'t want it to be a Republican that achieves it. They just need the division issue. If it actually has a chance of being achieved then it is useless and they don\'t want to waste any more resources on it. He killed it, and he\'s trying to get people to notice by keeping pointing out the way it disappeared overnight.\n\nThis isn\'t the first time, he did the same thing with the trans-gender bathroom issue which was supposed to be the big division issue of the election. He killed that with one sentence about not caring which bathroom they use in Trump Tower and forced the election to be about defence, immigration, trade and political corruption instead of some meaningless manufactured issue that lets both parties pretend to fight on something while offering no real difference on any of the actual policy issues.\n\nKeep this in mind when listening to anything Trump says about being open to stricter gun control. This is the new division issue, and nothing more. He can kill it whenever he wants, but it\'s a more contentious issue to the right than those other two so it would be risky. I think he tested the waters a little bit already.'

The people of America were given information that was being denied them by the DNC and they voted accordingly.

I know for a fact, if this happened in England in London or around certain other areas that have seen recent immigration there would be LOOTING and burglaries and things wouldn't go as smoothly here with everybody helping eachother out like what I'm seeing on the news in Texas. \n\nThere is a strong mentality towards 'anti-UK', with even second generation immigrants due to the fact that they've been brought up in bad areas, raised amongst others with similar feelings and a few years ago when Mark Duggin was killed (a known drug dealer), riots swept throughout England stemming from these same forgotten areas.\n\nWith our immigration levels at obscenely high levels, that thought process will only continue to grow as the people do, in numbers. \n\nWhat baffles me, is how America can be such a young country compared to the rest of the world, and yet still every American seems to come together in times like this? There's no rioting/looting...\n\nOr is my view of America too rosey? Has there actually been large scale looting and fucked up shit happening? \n\nBecause all I'm seeing on the news is people helping other people in a time of crisis. "

He went after Trump for locker room talk, yet Franken's actions were the opposite of talk.  \n\nEvery time one of these stories come out on the left, there's always someone to downplay or justify it.  \n\nI feel bad for the victim, because she only wanted to raise awareness and get some atonement.....but what she doesn't realize is that if she doesn't burn Franken at the stake with charges.....he's definitely going to hit her back, even if privately.  Al Franken isn't the type of guy to let this go, he's going to, even if quietly and indirectly, make that woman pay for coming out against him.  It might not be today or tomorrow, but he's going to use his connections to hurt her any way he can for causing him this trouble.  "
'Basically the exact same thing feminists did while Slick Willy was raping women.

'That day was my grandfather‚Äôs introduction to WW2. After this, he went on to march 100 miles in 3 Days to get to Bastogne. America‚Äôs greatness has always come from her people. As Patton said, American people will not tolerate a loser. That is American exceptionalism. Her people refuse to be denied when they want something bad enough. '
'My grandfather was a second lieutenant in a tank division in WW2.   He rarely spoke about the war and seemed to have a hard time with PTSD, but this was the eighties and nobody knew how to help him.  I learned of two key experiences he had that seem to have done the brunt of the damage.\n\n1) He was supposed to go on a Jeep patrol with a higher ranking officer but he hurt his ankle playing basketball.  Nothing too bad to send him home, but he limped for a few days.  His buddy offered todo the patrolfor him.  This buddy was about a week out from going home and had at least one young kid.  The Jeep wound up taking fire.  His friend was killed instantly.  I‚Äôm not sure about the officer.\n\n2) He worked in a cannon division.  They came upon a group of Americans who were taking massive Nazi fire.  It was a slaughter.  He was the highest ranking person present so made a decision.  They were transporting white phosphorous so he ordered it loaded into the cannons.  Now, white phosphorus is a chemical that burns through everything it touches.  I guess it was basically a war crime, but he saved hundreds of people who were being slaughtered.  He fired on the Nazis and listened to screams for what seemed like hours until they retreated.  He never saw the Nazi bodies, but he said the Americans he saved thanked him profusely.  Some cried about thinking they‚Äôd never see their families again.  Some offered him cigarettes and rations.  To them, he was a hero. To himself, he was a monster. \n\nWar is hell, and the patriots who fought in WW2 (and all wars) had to walk right through it.  I pray that we never have to send good American men to fight in rich men‚Äôs squabbles again.  Thank you to everyone who has served. '
"My maternal grandfather went up the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc. Hardest man I ever knew, even after a lifetime in the Army. After WW2 he hadn't had his fill of war, went to Korea. After that dustup he went back home, married my grandmother and built a 500 acre apple orchard out of the desert scrub of eastern Washington state. I once watched him beat a man senseless. The man's crime? Being a banker who thought he could mock and insult my grandfather for being a country rube."

How is it not Islams fault? More LGBT people died on 9/11 than died in multiple combined years, but we're blaming President Trump? \n\nfucking bias. They don't want to stop people from dying, they don't care that people are dying, they care about how they can blame someone they disagree with instead of blaming someone at fault."

'Indian American Pede here, let me tell you four red pill stories my grandfather used to tell me about islam \n\nStory 1: During the indo pak wars, when technology has not that advanced, We used to do a blackout ( all lights off, complete blackness). So that Pakistani airplanes cannot detect Indian cities and bomb it.  But there was these assholes who burned grass on their roof to give signal to the planes and celebrate. Traitors \n\nStory 2: This is how islam spread into the world. These were barbaric hordes going on a world wide rampage to loot , rape and murder anyone who came in their way.   They had a method to enlist able body men in their rank. After defeating ( and the usual raping, murdering and looting), they used to put a sword on the neck of the remaining men. Asked them three times " qubool hai" ( do you accept?) .  It was heads off vs accepting islam.  These people were then subjected to years of indoctrination , physical torture , brainwashing etc to accept islam. \n\nThese people, the converted ones were called Sunnis.  Interestingly, the more vicious terrorist organizations, al qaeda, ISIS etc are mainly Sunnis.  \n\nStory 3: This is told by my father and is most relevant to what is happening to the western world, about how they replaced hindu cities and villages in places like kashmir and other places .   They used to come with their crying children and wives, literally catch the feet of people of the village and the village head and say" We are alone, without shelter , food and poor, please let us in our village, we will be very grateful".   The good minded people of the village gave them food and shelter.  Then their relatives ( and there are a LOT ) also come and join the family. Nobody complains, as it is wrong to turn out someone you have given shelter.  They become a significant minorities. They now have political power.  Politicians start to pander to them. Come the next generation ( this is the kill shot).  Other people will birth only 2-4 children, they will birth A LOT, four or five times then a normal Indian. The next generation, they are the majority. They murder, rape and kick out the people who gave them shelter. The politicians turn a blind eye because of votes. An actual genocide/mass replacement happens in an entire state as a reason and till this date, it is islamophobic to recognize this\n\n\nI have told these stories here, because the exact same thing is happening in europe and the dems are trying to do with USA.  Politicians are very short sighted and only care about votes. '

'As a teenager who works fast food, $15 an hour is just absurd. Fast food is not the easiest job in the world believe it or not, as it can be extremely stressful. However, it is not even close to being the hardest job in the world. $7.25 will suit you just fine. Also, if you‚Äôre an adult making minimum wage, you probably made some piss poor decisions in life that got you there. '

In both states I was broke but in SC I had a bigger apartment and there was actually a strong middle class waiting for me to move up the ladder into. $15 min wage is retarded. It will make everything more expensive, cost jobs and squeeze the middle class. Let the market decide what I get paid and take away illegals and low skill immigrants who drive wages down.  '

It was because it's sounding their death knell.....the end of Democrat elitist control. \n\nThey didn't vote FOR this bill because it effectively ended any chance they had in the 2018 midterms to take either house and any chance at taking back the WH in 2020. \n\nThey didn't vote for it because they have no message, no money left in the coffers, too many of them are going to be going to jail or retiring early, which means they'll have no recognizable face, they lost the governorships, they lost the state assemblies, they lost the Supreme Court, they lost the national judiciary, and they're losing everything they politicized such as the FBI, the DOJ and the IRS. \n\nThe only thing they DO have left is control of legacy MSM and that's why they're pushing all the bullshit lies they can 24/7 using MSNBC, GMA, The View, CNN, Morning Joeanne and that dude Ricky Maddow.  \n\nEven THAT is crumbling. CNN is at unbelievable lows, liberal reporters are getting caught up in sexual harassment scandals, they're being forced to retract lies, people are waking up and ISM Internet Streaming Media is taking over.

What was in there about the person of interest, and if there was nothing, how did the dossier strengthen their case at all?\n\nAnd last, and most important, Steele was desperate to keep Trump from getting elected. Assuming for a moment that Trump was a Russian stooge, and this guy had the proof (which would be a reasonable reason to desperately not want Trump elected, if you had proof), why would anyone include false infomation with true information in the dossier? If I had rock solid proof the Clintons ordered a murder (pick any one, they\'ve had a lot of shady shit occur over the years), and wanted to send it to the FBI, the very last thing I would do is include a baseless b.s. claim also to throw doubt on the rest, like, "Not only did they have Seth Rich murdered, but I know Hillary personally killed Nicole Brown Simpson!"

Even for Hillary.\n\nIf you're referring to the sale of uranium... well, that's just being a traitor selling a strategic military resource to a rival nuclear power. If Trump were Putin and someone from America offered him uranium on a silver platter, he would accept it too.\n\nThe real collusion here would be between the Deep State (compromised elements within the executive branch), stooges in both parties e.g. McCain, and Big Media (social media giants, fake news merchants, Hollywood).\n\nThe 'Dossier' (the fabricated golden shower story) was the result of this unholy, subversive union. Mueller's so-called 'investigation' was the result of this unholy, subversive union.\n\nPutin had nothing to do with it.\n\nIn fact, Putin had been fighting the same elements within Russia: the usual suspects who want open borders, multiculturalism, Muslim migrants, transgender bathrooms etc.\n\nAlso, any politician in Europe who leaned towards nationalism was accused of being a 'Russian agent' or a 'Putin stooge'. Look at the leaders of Poland, Hungary and Austria now.\n\nEven pro-Brexit Nigel Farage was being accused of being a 'Russian agent'. Even conservative anchors on Fox News were demonized as 'Russian agents'.\n\nThere's collusion and conspiracy alright, but it has nothing to do with Russia."

Since Countries are now waking up, and standing up to forced immigration quotas, we could say that the war is being won. Once that\'s done, I expect the same thing to happen as what happened after previous world wars.  \nWWI -> League of Nations  \nWWII -> United Nations  \nWWIII -> New thing to replace "United Nations".  \n  \nMaybe it could be called "League of Nations that have similar goals, but will each stay Sovereign entities and deal with their own shit, internally, before making it everyone else\'s problem".'

'"What a cruel thing war is... to fill our hearts with hatred instead of love for our neighbors." -Robert E. Lee.\n\nWhat a total nazi bigot /s'
'I can\'t believe the stunning hypocrisy of so many of these people. "Tear down these \'monuments to slavery\' from 250 years ago!!" they exclaimed, while wearing diamonds in their ears and on their hands. That\'s a modern-day slavery fueled industry, that you\'re actively participating in, ladies and gents. And there is ZERO actual need for us to have a diamond.\n\n\n"But this one wasn\'t from slave nations!"  \n\nOh yea? How do you know that? Buying any diamond at all, makes the slavery mined one necessary to the next person. You\'re actively participating in slavery in the current day by buying diamonds. But of course and by all means, tear down that statue that\'s been there for 150 years. You\'re really helping!!'
"But even then that wasn't all the civil war was about. It was more about economics and voting power. This is why they had the 3/5th compromise because the south had a vastly lower population and wanted more power in congress.   \n  \nThen you have the price of cotton and the cotton trade. "
"Thing that really irks me about the statues is no one knows who the people actually were. They just seem them a symbol of racism. I could be remembering this wrong, but didn't Lee want VA to stay in the union, but once they seceded he decided to stay with his state regardless.\n\nAt the very end of the civil war, when Lee surrendered, the union soldiers outnumbered the confederates 5 to 1. Instead of massacring them like racist pigs, Lincoln spared them and allowed for a surrender. If Lincoln thought these living symbols of racism were worth leaving around as a reminder then I think the same."
'So far from engaging in a war to perpetuate slavery, I am rejoiced that Slavery is abolished. I believe it will be greatly for the interest of the South. So fully am I satisfied of this that I would have cheerfully lost all that I have lost by the war, and have suffered all that I have suffered to have this object attained.\n\nA quote from R E L'

"But he fought for the South! So he's racist! "
'But SJWs tell me Robert e. Lee was an evil slaver. I‚Äôm confuse now.'
'This is an excellent example of the Civil War being entirely about slavery, and also not about slavery.  It is also an excellent example of the idea that the soldier and the common man fight and die at the whim of the politician.\n\nThe politicians in the south decided that the federal government dictating abolition to the states was too far a reach, and it didn\'t hurt that they would have lost fortunes and would be living with a part of the population that would rightfully have sought them harm after being freed.\n\nHowever, Lee\'s quote says that for him, the fight wasn\'t about slavery.  He would have freed every slave to avoid it, which, unfortunately in this time in our history, begs the question "why did he fight?"  The fact that such a question must be asked is why the move to tear down monuments and erase inconvenient history is so sad.  Lee fought because his honor dictated he fight.  He fought for the south and for his state.  He didn\'t believe that slavery was the central identity of the south, otherwise he would have said that he would have fought to his last breath to defend it.  \n\nFor a century the defining feature of the Civil War wasn\'t slavery, it was Bother Against Brother.  The idea that America fought itself in a fight that could have been avoided.  That it was a tragic war fought for an evil institution.  Today we have lost the idea of it being a war between brothers because we have all been taught that it was a war between the good and just Union and the awful and evil Confederacy.  \n\nThose who forget their history are doomed to repeat it.'
'"I think it a greater evil to the white man than to the black race" - Lee on slavery'
'Robert E. Lee definitely didn\'t say this. Do you have any source? \n\nThis is what he actually thought about slavery: "The painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race, & I hope will prepare & lead them to better things."\n\nFrom a letter to his wife from December 1856. He never spoke out against slavery. '
'In an 1856 letter to his wife, Lee wrote, "In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral & political evil in any Country..."'
'A nice quote but no one can find proof he said it.\n\nThere is proof he said the below to his wife. While nuanced, and at least admitting holding another human in bondage of slavery is evil, it is still quite wimpy in its denunciation and willing to "wait until the right time" for slavery to end...unlucky for those who were presently being whipped and sold away from their children, etc etc etc. \n\n>The views of the Pres: of the Systematic & progressive efforts of certain people of the North, to interfere with & change the domestic institutions of the South, are truthfully & faithfully expressed. The Consequences of their plans & purposes are also clearly set forth, & they must also be aware, that their object is both unlawful & entirely foreign to them & their duty; for which they are irresponsible & unaccountable; & Can only be accomplished by them through the agency of a Civil & Servile war. **In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral & political evil in any Country. It is useless to expatiate on its disadvantages. I think it however a greater evil to the white man than to the black race, & while my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more strong for the former. The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, socially & physically. The painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race, & I hope will prepare & lead them to better things. How long their subjugation may be necessary is known & ordered by a wise Merciful Providence.** Their emancipation will sooner result from the mild & melting influence of Christianity, than the storms & tempests of fiery Controversy. This influence though slow, is sure. The doctrines & miracles of our Saviour have required nearly two thousand years, to Convert but a small part of the human race, & even among Christian nations, what gross errors still exist! **While we see the Course of the final abolition of human Slavery is onward, & we give it the aid of our prayers & all justifiable means in our power, we must leave the progress as well as the result in his hands who sees the end; who Chooses to work by slow influences;** & with whom two thousand years are but as a Single day. Although the Abolitionist must know this, & must See that he has neither the right or power of operating except by moral means & suasion, & if he means well to the slave, he must not Create angry feelings in the Master; that although he may not approve the mode which it pleases Providence to accomplish its purposes, the result will nevertheless be the same; that the reasons he gives for interference in what he has no Concern, holds good for every kind of interference with our neighbors when we disapprove their Conduct; Still I fear he will persevere in his evil Course. Is it not strange that the descendants of **those pilgrim fathers who Crossed the Atlantic to preserve their own freedom of opinion, have always proved themselves intolerant of the Spiritual liberty of others?** (<--pfft!!)\n\nSo to recap: Nice to admit slavery is bad, pretty evasive of moral responsibility to say, "Well gee, I just cannot comprehend how we could end this, except or you know, ending it, freeing people and giving them some land, so while God convinces me slavery is bad, I\'ll just have to wait for God to find a way to end it in a couple generations......"\n\nAccording to Lincoln, God\' Solution: Civil war (2nd Innagural): https://spu.edu/depts/uc/response/summer2k6/features/lincoln.asp\n\n'

He see's all that in the mirror, when all I see is a pip squeak that I could easily take in a fight.  \n\nAt 53 and a 'high profile' person, you don't just stumble across 15 year olds on the internet to talk to.  That means  his crime isn't merely sexting a 15yo, he had to plan it, hunt down that 15yo from some site, talk to them, get them interested, try to prim them to do what he wants, etc.  That involves a lot of steps, a lot of decision making, and a lot of effort.  \n\nWhat I do know is that with such a light sentence, Weiner is going to be back in the news again in a few years.  There's no way that he stops.  \n\nWhat they should do for people like him is force chemical castration on them at least.  By his own admittance he can't control himself.  After he's released, for the rest of his life they should regularly inject him with chemical castration to make it so that he can no longer get sexual pleasure from thinking about little girls.  "

'Other than just reeeeing for the sake of reeeeing, what are leftists mostly upset about here? That he allegedly used the word ‚Äúshithole‚Äù at all (the vulgarity)? That he allegedly directed it at specific nations (so it‚Äôs like elitist bullying)? Or that those specific nations largely contain darker skinned people (so he‚Äôs a racist)? \n\nWhich part of the vulgar racist bully narrative are they most faux-outraged about?\n\nTrump himself says he only used ‚Äútough‚Äù language, not this particular foul language. Even still, do I personally ‚Äúlike‚Äù this? Honestly, no. Not really. I tend to think cursing is lazy, something you should largely outgrow once you hit your 30‚Äôs. But that‚Äôs just me. Foul or tough language is certainly not something I‚Äôm going to feign outrage over. Besides, Presidents have used foul language as far back as you care to look. If anything is ‚ÄúPresidential,‚Äù it‚Äôs using colorful language.\n\nTo the other aspects, as the President‚Äôs tweets made clear this morning, these are ‚Äúvery poor and troubled, high-crime countries that are doing very badly.‚Äù That‚Äôs the point. And who could disagree with that? I‚Äôm sure leftists would have a hundred anti-American reasons as to WHY those nations are that way, but that won‚Äôt change the fact that Trump‚Äôs tweet is correct. Anyone who doesn‚Äôt start with the premise that Trump is a racist bully could easily see this was likely all he meant from the moment this ‚Äústory‚Äù broke yesterday. \n\nThe Refugee program (which is a separate issue) is where America can debate showing compassion to those fleeing from poor, troubled, high-crime nations. But when it comes to our official legal immigration policy, I agree with the President that it should favor merit, track record, and evidence (like applying for a job interview), not tip the scales toward ‚Äúcompassion,‚Äù ‚Äúfairness,‚Äù ‚Äúethnic diversity,‚Äù or ‚Äúpotential‚Äù at the exclusion of competency. \n\nIf people from other nations want to come here, live here, work here, pay taxes here, and eventually become citizens, why would we not attempt to actively prioritize the ‚Äúbest‚Äù of that bunch? Once you bust out of the lazy name-calling leftist brainwashing that such a policy would somehow be racist/sexist/bigoted, you can see with clear eyes why such a policy would benefit you, your children, your communities, and America as a whole.\n\n'

Who knows WHY they did not start the process while they were here illegally. One guy was here 30 YEARS illegally with a family and his stupid ass got deported. When asked why in all that time he did not apply to become a citizen, he said ‚ÄúI just never got around to it‚Äù - yet he was able to get around with it to benefit from the country he was living in illegally. \n\nFuck him and fuck all illegals straight to hell '

We know that number is total bullshit. Vet them all, make them prove they are aspiring to actually be American and contribute to our society. Its not what I want, but there would be a lot of leverage for us to get some other shit done. If it is what needs to happen for the wall and an end to chain migration and the lottery then so be it.

'This shutdown looks particularly bad for the Democrats. The narrative is that they shutdown the government in a fight over non-American citizens.

'Democrats formed the Confederacy, seceded from the Union and fought a Civil War (1861 to 1865) ‚Äì a war where over 600,000 citizens were killed, including many thousands of blacks ‚Äì in order to keep blacks in slavery because the Democrats had built their economic base on the backs of black slaves.\n\nDemocrats enacted Fugitive Slave laws to keep blacks from escaping from plantations and instigated the 1856 Dred Scott decision which legally classified blacks as property. Democrats pushed to pass the Missouri Compromise to spread slavery into 50% of the new states. Democrats also pushed to achieve passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act that was designed to spread slavery into all of the new states.\n\nNorthern anti-Civil War Democrats, called "copperheads", did not want to be drafted to fight in the Civil War. Starting in 1861, they attacked blacks in virtually every Northern city and pushed for a negotiated peace that would have resulted in an independent Confederacy where blacks were kept in slavery. In New York, anti-Civil War Democrats engaged in "Four Days of Terror" against the city‚Äôs black population from July 13-16, 1863.\n\nThe anti-Civil War chant of the Democrats, as reported by one Pennsylvania newspaper, was: "Willing to fight for Uncle Sam", but not "for Uncle Sambo." These anti-Civil War Democrats verbally attacked Republican President Abraham Lincoln because he fought to free blacks from slavery and make his Emancipation Proclamation a reality ‚Äì a Proclamation that became the source of the Juneteenth celebrations that occur in black communities today.'

But you can bet (see Iraq war protests) that if there were significant number, you\'d have rooftop images to show it.\n\nJust look at the money they "raised" for the balloon. There are 70+ million people in the UK at any one time and it has had international press coverage, yet they barely broke ¬£30K. Khan\'s protest balloon is at ¬£51K, with twice the time remaining and 30%+ more backers.\n\nThe whole thing is a nothing burger and Trump\'s been spitting the truth and they hate it; about trade, Brexit, crime and immigration in the UK. People agree, the "independent" press and the government have chosen to vilify conservatives/the right leaning here for the same reason they\'re doing it in the US: Suros and the rest of the globalist cronies. That makes it difficult to be heard and in the UK and it can even land you in a (very dangerous) jail!\n\nAs for "freedom of speech", that doesn\'t exist in the UK. Orwell was English and it showed in his work. The Empire never ended. :(\n\n...Sadly, the hubris of those in charge may push the (very) large majority down a painful and costly route, but it will happen if these sorts of tactics aren\'t tempered soon.\n'

They would have all these protests planned and organized but it would ruin everything when they can't mobilize for an entire week since it would just be staggered protests instead of one big one and by the end of the week, no one cares anymore."
"So it doesn't matter who was nominated, they just hate that TRUMP nominated them, correct?"
'The grievance industry on the left is nothing short of amazing.  I want to know everything about it.\n\nWho printed the signs.  Who paid for them.  Who/What spreads the word on social media and who/what funds them.  How have they generated big turn outs when only a handful show up at ours.  There has to be a massive machine behind them.\n\nI want to know the name of every corporation that ever gave a single cent to these bigoted degenerates since 2016.'

"I was flipping radio stations on the way to work this morning and on a hip hop and R&B station they were discussing the pick. Saying to be concerned and worried, because you don't know what will eventually be supported. Basically causing a false alarm only to follow it up with the last pick has been surprisingly less harsh than they expected. What??? Calling for outrage for the unknown and then in the same breathe admitting the previous outrage was uncalled for. "

'This is real racism in action. Ironically, people that cry "Racism" about everything have no problem with this. '
"It's racism. But it's deeper than that. It's designed to dumb down society. This increases the odds of smart people not making it to ivy league. It also goes into the workplace. If you don't hire more qualified people then you have people with degrees who aren't as useful. And so they just outsource because colleges kids aren't qualified. They'll get H1 visas for Indians and Asians.... Oh the irony of it all.\n\nAnd for the record, you can have smart kids from urban areas. I think there needs to be changes in their social structure.

"Standardized test scores are not everything, but statistically, an Asian medical student would be more qualified going into to med school and would statistically graduate higher in their class since they we're filtered by a higher standard. Higher class ranking is also not everything, but there is, I would think, a real correlation between class rank and quality of doctor. Would it be racist not to want a black doctor because it's more likely they are lower quality? You could get a doctor like Ben Carson - in the most difficult field (neuroscience) and in the top 1% - rock star. But, with the system the way it is, you have no idea what you're getting. It's a gamble. I hate to even have to think like this, but with varying standards based on race, I can't help it."

"I read this article this morning to see what they had to say. BIG MISTAKE! They rarely cited any sources, and when they did it was to themselves. If you're a news site being accused of not covering things correctly, you'd think you'd use other websites to prove your point. They contradicted themselves as well (ex. 8 & 10). For people outside r/The_Donald that think he didn't call out the neo nazis and kkk because he said there is violence and bigotry on both sides is completely wrong. Take a second and really think about it. Is there not? This is not news, it is an opinion piece of shit."

At all.\n\nIts not the same thing guys, not at all. '
'Google is in a very precarious position right now, especially with YouTube. They are gambling hard on several fronts and there is a good chance they will get burned.\n\n1) YouTube: For the past few months, overly sensitive SJW demonetization policies have angered top youtubers and the wounds are still fresh. See: h3h3, Pewdiepie, DeFranco, so many others. Their latest step this week is a huge gamble: outright quarantining anything that doesn‚Äôt fit their SJW agenda. No comments, no recommendations, must be logged in, no appearing in search results. It‚Äôs truly Orwellian. \n\nAt this point, it would take is ONE major youtuber for the exodus to begin. Particularly if PewDiePie were to declare a strike, it would be over for YouTube. Over. Consumers are aware of Google‚Äôs shenanigans and they would follow the big youtubers to another platform.\n\n2) Re: Google: Already Google is facing massive antitrust fines in Europe and its only going to get worse. If you think google has a stranglehold in the USA, it‚Äôs 10x worse in Europe. In Italy etc, Google controls 98%+ of searches. The EU just slapped Google with a huge fine over prioritizing its shopping results before other services.\n\nGoogle is anticompetitive and I predict in the next 5 years we will be seeing the antitrust hammer (Sherman Act) drop HARD on Google and other monopolistic tech giants. Their strangehold on the internet will soon blow up in their faces.\n\nPedes, we must shout loudly and advocate for the Trust Busting to begin. These monopolies are hurting our people; they are hurting the internet; they are hurting our country; they are hurting our pocketbooks. It‚Äôs time to break up Google.'
'Fuck YouTube. Fuck Google.'
'There is a communistic purge happening all over the internet right now. The problem is it is mainly affecting white nationalist types, so the stories are not getting any traction on civic nationalist subs like this one. In that sense Charlottesville was a disaster for the right, because it divided us (the new right) pretty badly, forcing civic nationalists to disavow and distance themselves from white nationalists. (keep in mind the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville was organized by an Occupy Wall Street Obama voter; seriously google it).\n\nDivide and conquer is what the commies are aiming for, and it worked. We should not be sympathetic to racists, but we should acknowledge that they\'re still Americans who have a right to free speech. And we should stand up for their rights, because I guarantee they\'re coming for us next. In fact I\'m surprised how fast they\'re going for mainstream right leaning politicians, the brazen fucks. Straight from skinheads to libertarians.\n\n\nStormfront, which has been up for like 20 years, has been taken down. The Daily Stormer, the most popular white nationalist blog on the internet, literally cannot find a host. The Daily Stormer is now only being served on the dark web. Even Rebel Media, which has denounced white nationalism (Gavin McInnes has mixed race children ffs) is having hosting issues.\n\nNow we see that fucking Ron Paul is starting to be censored. We need to get these stories to the top of td so that people know wtf is going on, even when white nationalists are the victims. We need to stop worrying about being seen as racists. I know Trump and my fellow pedes here are not racist, and that\'s all that really matters. Doesn\'t matter how much we disavow, the leftist nutjobs will continue to scream "Nazi" at us.\n\nThe internet is the only way for us to unite and rally together. Imagine trying to fight fake news and get Trump elected without the internet. It just wouldn\'t have worked, and we\'d have a communist side of beef sitting in the oval office right now. If we lose the internet, we lose period.\n\nNow, there is one counterargument here, which is that Youtube, Google, GoDaddy, etc are all private companies . That\'s true, but the organizations that oversee domain name and IP address assignment  operate under contract with the federal government. So if American citizens are prevented from obtaining an IP address or domain name under which to publish their views on the internet, due to the objectionable nature of those views, there is a serious first amendment issue that the government needs to address. Companies like GoDaddy essentially operate under contract with the US government, so they should not be free to turn away customers just because of their political views. We need to fight this hard.'

'It comes down to this:  if the left\'s message was so right, so just, so correct in its ideology... why the need to censor "hate"?\n\nWhy can\'t they let their ideas stand on their own?  Their policies succeed or fail on their own merits, without having to push *down* the ideas and voices of those who oppose them?\n\nIf they\'re so fucking right about everything all the time, and if the "majority of Americans" agree with what they\'re saying and doing... why are they removing dissenting opinions at all?  What\'s so frightening about hearing the other side out, if the other side\'s arguments have no merit?\n\nThe answer is simple: **they know they\'re fucking wrong**.  They know it, the American public knows it, and now that Trump is President?  Everyone knows it.\n\nTHAT\'S why they censor.  Not because of "suitability" or "hate".'

But I had been seeing all these **magnificent**, well-organized, **TREMENDOUS!** posts and memes that would trigger people SO HARD they\'d [for real] **threaten to kill themselves!**\n\nAnd that shit was **FUNNY!** Immediately I was like, "Damn, aren\'t you all mainly *progressive* and believe in free speech? Can\'t you see how MAGNIFICENT these people are?!" but they couldn\'t and I jokingly (seriously, it was jokes) said "if you\'re really going to kill yourself, why are you typing?" because it HAD to be jokes, or they\'d be DEAD, right? (Apparently some weren\'t joking, or they quit posting, IDK. Fuck em.)\n\nI\'d been on Eddit a LONG time, so I had made some friends in anime, linux, sec, privacyiotools, cfb, etc subs as well as ASOIAF (my primary sub). But T_D was just **different! I saw the memes!**\n\nAnd THEN ppl I chatted with even IRL were like, **SWERVING ME** because (for example) in one sub, *their* god George RR Martin who has taken them all to the bank (me too, admittedly) and trolled TF out of them, that fat-ass cunt went all libtard and basically proved himself to be a spirit cooker. (Seems obvious now in retrospect, of course.) I still like asoiaf, and there are secret Pedes ALL throughout there (heh, **we dog whistle** and know who\'s who), but fuck GRRM, right?\n\nAnyway that was the glorious part of these posts showing up on All ‚Äî **SO MUCH ENERGY!** I mean I knew Trump was going to win even posting in S4P, because Hitlary poison pills everyone, but to have all these people probably around my age, and teens, and even the occasional Based Boomer, posting fuckin **PATRIOTIC MEMES OF TRUTH BOMBS**, and GAFing about their Bill of Rights, was just something **I had to be part of.** And it. Was. SPECTACULAR seeing the REEEEEEEEEEING from "progressive" Eddit, but nimbly navigating all the stupid roadblocks Eddit threw out against the sub, so much so that admins had to CHEAT to keep Pedes **off** the front page... THAT was an awakening! Like, **they wanted to kill the human spirit!!!**\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nYeah but then I just made T_D my Eddit landing page so IDGAF about other subs now, unless it\'s an anime, cfb, or tech really, and I use shortcut to get from here to other subs (I never see All anymore).\n\n#\\#HowT_DChangedMyLife üòÜ'

"Okay let me just say this:\n\nThe responsibility for removing illegal immigrants is held by Federal Agents.\n\nWhen Obama came into office, instead of working with congress in order to create an actual legal system to deal with illegal immigrants, Obama instead created an executive order (DACA), which basically told federal agents to stand down on the issue of illegal immigrants.\n\nSo basically Obama used a loophole way of getting what he wanted. Instead of making an actual law, he went around congress for his own gain. He in effect created a law by disbanding another one.\n\nThe problem with this, is that it isn't what the American people voted for, and it's not a law, and can be easily removed by future presidents.\n\nIt's a weak power move that isn't exactly constitutional.\n\nTrump has destroyed DACA, but not in the way people think.\n\nInstead of letting DACA stand, Trump instead destroyed the executive order, and has given back the authority of creating it to congress, which is **the way our government is supposed to work**, and which Obama refused to do. When congress is done creating a version of it, based on the opinion of their constituents (the American people), Trump then has the option of letting it through, or vetoing it.\n\nTrump isn't exactly sending a bunch of illegal immigrants home. He is instead fixing up bullshit Obama left behind. Trump is not racist, he is not a bigot. He does NOT care about immigrants, he cares about ridiculous and broken power plays left behind by Obama, and he cares about illegal immigrants who use tax money, but don't pay taxes.\n\nI think that's reasonable of him. Who the fuck expects the American people to pay for a bunch of randos. How the fuck is it unreasonable to not want to pay for them. It's not racist, in fact they are the ones committing a wrong doing, by **literally stealing from the American people**.\n\nI and the majority of the country do NOT care about immigrants (in 99% of the cases of immigration). What we don't want is people being let in by the left in some misguided sense of compassion, and letting them steal a huge amount of money.\n\nWhat we need to do is make immigration easy and effective. Criminals shouldn't be allowed in. Some people should be preferred (like those with high education or high skill). And all immigrants should have the same rights and responsibilities of every other citizen.\n\nAnd BTW, Obama currently has the record for the highest amount of immigrants deported, so everyone whining about Trump deporting all these helpless people should\n\n1. Realize he's not\n2. Realize you're uneducated about your own favorite president (Obama)\n\nCredit to styx\n"

However, if he was he nevertheless wasn't going to profit from releasing FALSE information.\n\nThen he was murdered and the Sessions FBI is complicit in the coverup."

There are countless foreign families coming to the US legally. If they can do it legally, so should others. No excuses. The fact that these criminals and their descendants are called 'dreamers' is nauseating. You have the right to dream of making it in the US if you are a US citizen, or  if you are foreign born but in the US legally. \n\nThe more compromise you make and the more you give stuff to illegal immigrant's children, the more they will demand. I know some people want to give amnesty (some people stress that they don't want these people eligible for citizenship), but chances are, the children of illegal immigrants will continue to support to having a relaxed stance regarding illegal immigration. They will continue to support soft policies on immigration both legal and illegal.  How many children of illegal immigrants will sincerely criticize and rebuke their parents for breaking the law? My guess is none. How many children of illegal immigrants will ask for tougher policies on illegal immigration? My guess is none."

(We still don't even know the name/picture of the bucket bomber, and there is yet another attack.)\nCheck\n2.) Make sure to state that terrorism is not the cause (Will Isis claim responsibility for this one)\nCheck\n3.) Make sure to associate Trump with racism when he points out the obvious. I imagine SB trolls are waiting for his Tweet to accomplish this."

"Through fear and intemidation the ways of Islam spreads. Females will be the first to submit as they fear permanent disfigurement. \n\nWhat are we going to do about this? If their government will not protect them from Islam, who will? Will you wait around until your wife or sister is splashed on their way to work, or out with friends? \n\nIt doesn't take a majority of Muslims to throw acid on the face of unveiled women to prove anything. The fact its done at all, while they remain silent (through fear of retaliation themselves), proves this toxic ideology has no place in the West. \n\nSimply ask yourself, how far are you willing to be pushed before you take defensive matters into your own hands? "
'The only way to counter an acid attack is with a BASED attack'
'They should charge acid attacks with the same sentence as murder.  Although with it being Europe, I doubt they even harshly punish murder.  \n\nSociety has gotten too soft.  I\'m tired of this "psychological issue" defense and "let\'s rehabilitate them".   \n\nWhen people are attacked by acid, they are disabled and disfigured for life.  Their life, is effectively over.  They can\'t go out in public, they can\'t find love, and the are in life long physical pain.  Only people who have large areas of scar tissue know just how painful scar tissue can be.  It aches, you feel every flex of the skin like sand paper even long after you\'re healed.  \n\nThere is no live and let live.  There is only liberals laying down to be conquered.  For liberals claiming to be the party of science, they sure as heck have forgotten the basic rules of nature.  Liberals may not want to compete with other groups like muslims, but not competing in a race doesn\'t mean that the race doesn\'t take place.  The worst part is they don\'t even realize the race exists.  They\'re standing at the starting line oblivious while muslims and immigrants are killing them off and replacing them.  '

'"But real communism has never been tried." That\'s because real communism is as much a utopian/dystopian fantasy as it is a political philosophy or economic theory. Real communism is also based on theories of industrialization. Marx believed that the abundance of resources that occured during the industrial revolution would trigger a spontaneous, organic workers\' revolution. The workers would realize that rich people and the nobility were keeping them in poverty and hoarding all the resources. They would then rise up and kill the evil social classes and establish socialist society. That society would then evolve into a worldwide communist utopia. Lenin, Stalin and Mao actually rejected some of Marx\'s ideas. Stalin in particular believed that communism could spread with revolution from country to country. His "state based communism" still relied heavily on industrialization, but industry could be formed after the establishment of socialist governments. Of course, the Soviet union collapsed and China implemented their own form of capitalism. However, the thing that people need to realize is that "real communism" not only never occurred, it\'s really an OBSOLETE FANTASY. Much of the world has been industrialized for over a century, yet the workers revolution never occurred. Heck, we\'re in the information age now. Yet brainwashed liberals still wanna talk about real communism, gimme a break!'

Groups are very essential to survival. \n\n- anyone who does not fit to the commonly accepted standard set by a Group must be assimilated\n\n- if the person is unwilling to be assimilated, or is unable to due to reason such as skin color, the person must be killed. \n\n- killing can be literal or non literal, such as exclusion, ignoring, publicly humiliation or main stream media propaganda.\n\nFor example, the left became the standard in the 70s and things are getting more extreme every year. However, since the rules of the hive mind still apply, we see very few Black People on high positions even though the left claim that they are anti racism. They are full of shit and they are not even aware of it. \n\nAnd then there is the road to genocide through five levels. \n\n1. Public debate, trying to unite \n2. Peaceful demonstrations. \n3. Violent demonstrations, lone Wolf terrorist attacks\n4. Group terrorist attacks, enforcing a monopoly on the truth. If a populist arises to unite the extremist such as a Hitler figure during a crisis then we move on to the next phase. Judging by the terrorism in europe and the monopoly on the truth by the left, we are already in level 4.\n5. Genocide followed by a dictatorship or a ruling elite with a implemented thoughtpolice. \n\nThis structure can be seen throughout history. Christianity or muslim, left or right, Black or White, White VS White. \n\nBullying, racism, discrimination, fascism. It all originates from the hive mind. When one looks at humans from space, we behave very similar to ants. Individuality is an illusion. The only difference between al the hive minds is that in islam, muslims openly admit they will kill anyone not willing to assimilate while everyone else has lost their spines '

'>[Silicon Valley tech giants have come together to oppose Donald Trump and his candidacy for the US presidency.](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/trump-would-be-disaster-innovation-say-silicon-valley-tech-giants-1570748) \n\n>Authors of the letter include Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, **Reddit** co-founder Alexis Ohanian, **Facebook** co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, Qualcomm executive chairman Paul Jacobs, Slack CEO and co-founder Stewart Butterfield, Hyperloop One general counsel Marvin Ammori, Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake, Tumblr CEO David Karp, **Twitter** VP of products Josh McFarland and former **Google** director Kim Malone, among others.\n\nThis is just to cement that reddit as a company is firmly anti-Trump.  So naturally when The_D started getting hundreds of thousands of *active* subscribers who actually clicked the upvote buttons (something most redditors don\'t do), reddit wasn\'t happy.  \n\nUnder the old algorithm, more votes = more posts featured on /all.  And The_D\'s sheer numbers meant lots of Trump posts appearing on the front Page.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter doing absolutely nothing about the Sanders spam for nearly a year, reddit admins began feverishly working to combat The_Donald spam.  While there was no announcement that they were changing how votes on The_D were counted, we did wake up one morning to this:\n\n[Why is literally everything on r/all from the_donald? - EnoughTrumpSpam](http://archive.is/Rl02s)\n\n>This isn\'t normal spam.

All /the_donald, and mostly posts with a score of 0.\n\nSuddenly, /all was nothing but posts from The_Donald, and the votes were mostly 0.  Everyone thought reddit had been hacked, but it turns out the admins were just "tweaking" the algorithm.  \n\nNo one knows exactly what the change was intended to be, but clearly it was the value of votes on The_D.  But it was broken, and the catastrophic result was everything on /all (at least the first 30 pages) was posts from The_D.  With zero votes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThen there was the Trump AMA.  Everyone remembers that Obama\'s AMA was the no.1 post of all time, with uncountable upvotes.  When Trump did his AMA, it never even reached /all.  Nowhere to be found, despite over 40,000+ upvotes (that also counts downvotes).  \n\n[Donald trump AMA not in /r/all - bugs](http://archive.is/AiYuC)\n\nHowever, a nude drawing of Trump on /EnoughTrumpSpam posted at the same time as the AMA went straight to the top of the Front Page, despite having far, far less votes.\n\n[Trump\'s AMA, with 12,000 Points, 46,000 Votes, and 63% Upvote, didn\'t reach the top of r/All.

What other steps have they taken since then?  \n\nAll we do know is **a.** reddit has rules targeting only The_Donald, and **b.** it started with one, then more followed.  And reddit previous played with how votes on The_D worked, unintentionally resulting in a catastrophic blunder where ALL posts on /all were from The_D.  \n\n(My guess: it was the *Nuclear Ghandi bug*.  When posts on T_D were marked below zero, they "flipped" to the highest number possible: 9999999999999...etc)\n\nAdd to that how the Trump AMA never reached /all despite ending with nearly 50K upvotes (factoring in downvotes), and Spez\' explanation why contradicted his own explanation of how votes worked... and it paints a picture.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd after all this, look at reddit today:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/QTbPnoT.jpg\n\nThe_Donald has enormous traffic with every post having roughly 5,000-10,000 upvotes... yet do you see anything on /all?

'We have a major problem in Sydney with housing  affordibility. The Greens Party (who actually do quite well in Australia) are always arguing for more affordable housing whilst assuring us that cutting immigration is racist. The main reason we have this crisis is our insane immigration levels'
"One of the problems with the DNC is that they have too many conflicting interests. Trying to tell unions and illegal immigrants that you have both their backs is impossible to do at one time. Same with telling the LGBT crowd that you are fighting for their rights while at the same time allying yourself with Muslim groups farther right than the Republican party. The big tent has grown too large for it's own poles to support. "
"That's one thing nobody on the left has been able to answer me. Black people in the US have been fucked by illegal immigration and globalism. The entire black community is more fucked today than it ever was under Jim Crow and segregation. Want to fix black poverty?

"Same thing with importing rapefugees and ending 'rape culture'. Can't have both."
"Government can't set an arbitrary high value to low skilled labor without toxic effects on the economy. That is a fail all by itself. Illegal invasion just makes it worth."
"It truly is hilarious how leftists will simultaneously advocate for raising the minimum wage, and claim that businesses can totally afford it, but at the same time, insist that cheap under-the-table, illegal immigrant labor is absolutely vital for the US economy to function. Which is it? If we should be raising the minimum wage, we obviously don't need any illegal immigrants, and if we need illegal immigrants, we obviously can't afford to raise the minimum wage! "
"Because the fight for $15 people don't want wages to get there organically, they want the law to *force* it. And then either our economy will go to shit because all the companies, even larger ones, collapse under having to pay even brand new migrants $15/hour for sub-basic work, *or* our infrastructure will go to shit because every company ever will start paying people under the table and we'll have no tax revenue to fix anything anymore."

Ask yourself: What could be the true goal of a person who simultaneously holds both these positions? Could it be that they style themselves as the party for "jobs and higher wages" so poor people will vote for them, all the while being invested in keeping those people poor through mass immigration so they continue to vote democrat?\n\nMass immigration also serves the purpose of removing and replacing Whites, which is the ultimate goal of any Leftist group, but they need the votes to do that, and they need poor people to get votes.'

The mass awakening, resistance, and response of so many engaged and informed people perplexes them. They can\'t adapt or compromise from their far left extremism and it is their undoing. It\'s why Hillary lost. And, why they keep loosing. They keep resorting to their classic playbook of deception, lying, and Saul Alinsky tactics in hopes it will magically work again. They desperately need these immigrant votes. Fresh political meat for their political meat grinder. We have the upper hand. But we cannot let up now. A cornered animal is a dangerous one. I believe this desperation will greatly increase as the truth comes out. These people are dangerous and will do ANYTHING to stay in power and control.

For example, am I not allowed to follow the democratic ideals of TODAY without being associated with things in the past. In other words, am I allowed to like to 2018 Golden State Warriors without having to give a fuck about Chris Mullin? When democrats make a point, it shouldn\'t have anything to do with the past results. If I believe they are doing something right, I completely disregard the things they did in the past because its not the same people nor is it the same situation. I rambled so don\'t know if that makes sense. I guess I just find people arguing the histories of "parties" to be weird'

The Democratic Party has been solving nothing.\n\n5) The most sad and paralyzingly difficult part of this all: Democratic Party policies have spearheaded racism in this country for over a century. This includes Jim Crow Laws and Mandatory Minimum Sentences for drugs, two of the single-handedly most harmful things to happen to Black Americans since the Emancipation Proclamation was passed.\n\nAnyone on the right - especially a Trump supporter - is painted by the modern mainstream media to be a racist. It is so very important that we here in this community and other conservative ones be vocal advocates for the rights of black Americans, and attempt to make the Right a more friendly place for discussions on issues within Black communities. That may mean rethinking some of our own views, but here\'s why it\'s so important that we do so:\n\nThe Democratic Party has failed Black Americans. They failed them generations ago with "separate but equal" and they fail them every day by discouraging free political thought within Black American communities.\n\nWe can point fingers at the Democratic Party all day, but there\'s something much more important to do.\n\nSupport Black Americans. Their struggle in this country is historic - it is not a mirage, and it is not over. This post by Chance the Rapper is just one realization proving that.'

I\'ve seen some of the results of it personally and they\'ve been very, very destructive, both for the country and for the Americans who fell for it by marrying the foreigner and bringing them here.\n\nEnjoy.'

Why the fuck the city and state didn‚Äôt move the middle easterners to the ghetto of Paterson and fix that place up.

'I live here. The KKK had a short march here in March and nothing at all happened, people ignored it, because they are ridiculous these days and I assume they have right to their own thoughts and opinions. But Antifa and BLM physically attacked them. Also, a white nationalist does not equal a white supremacist. The rally today was to preserve Virginia\'s history which is being eroded and erased -- look into the Lee Park issue itself. The \'wildest\' slogan was "We will not be erased.". White-shaming and violence against whites is a serious problem that no one talks about and isn\'t considered "racist." This is part of Obama and Soros\' legacy: As are the hate groups who specifically target and humiliate cops. I don\'t care who has their meetings and share their interests and socialize--but when the agenda IS violence against certain persons--and that\'s the Panthers and BLM and CAIR and ANTIFA and Muslim Brotherhood--THEY\'RE are the violent ones and THEY always get free passes.

"This is what happens when people hijack 'Right' to mean something no one should condone. They took us down in the muck with them today. I would say there were 2k ppl from each side there tops. There is a lesson to be learned for us. It will take very few more assholes hijacking our movement, through pariah like means, for the MSM to equate all we stand for to hate. In fact, we stand for individual freedom and the right not to be discounted in any political conversation due to our affiliations or ethnicity, which allows for people to wave whatever flag they choose and let society be the judge. The neo-nazis can do whatever they like peacefully; but they will NOT corrupt our movement or use it's success to spread their dead message of hate. When they wave a flag that my ancestors fought like hell to dismantle they are misguided, much like a BLM person blaming white ppl for all their problems.

"Take social issues out of the equation, and what is left over is the same person when you look at Obama, the Bush‚Äôs, and the Clinton‚Äôs, and Nixon. Their accomplishments are primarily this:\n\n>Hand democracy, government, diplomatic decisions, bill proposals, and crime management away to corporate CEOs, especially banks, and unelected international organizations\n\n>Enable manufacturers to take production and the job market from American citizens, causing mass poverty and crime to increase. \n\n>Change policy to enable corporations to manufacture in US prisons (where work conditions dont need to meet the same standards, including wages). \n\n>Through ‚Äúfree trade agreements‚Äù enable manufacturers to be able to manufacture in third world countries that dont yet have enough independence and power to stop our corporations from systematically exploiting them and their government, to stop them from violating their rights, or to stop them from hijacking their governments indefinitely thereby preventing them from having protections of their human rights which dont serve the interests of unlimited neo-liberal profit. \n\n>Increase policing, and mass surveillance and/or prohibitions for victimless ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù, in order to increase the prison population for the prison lobby that pays their campaigns to keep them in power\n\n>Excuse Saudi Arabia for all human rights violations, political acts of aggression, and military operations, so that our corporate/political class can middleman their oil (been happening since ). Excuse them for pumping billions of dollars into radicalization mosques that they\xa0‚Äúcharitably‚Äù build in their surrounding nations and any nation with growing muslim populations (whether due to already existing populations or due to immigration and refugees) including European countries, all while Saudi Arabia takes on exactly 0 refugees in their massive empty refugee camps. Buy weapons from the private military industry who lobbys for you to do so, then arm the Saudi-radicalized groups and have them fight eachother in order to destabilize the region, and help them along with drones and US military invasion. Destabilize the oil-rich neighbors of Saudi Arabia so our corporate/political class can middleman their Oil, and sell weapons in the process.\n\n**That‚Äôs Obama**. That‚Äôs Bush and daddy Bush. That‚Äôs Hillary and Bill. That was Nixon. The list of politicians is much bigger than that, but those are the ones I can give you the most elaborate details about (if you were to ask for them and need sources), their exact policies on these matters, and the effects of those policies as they relate to mass systemic violations of human rights nationally and internationally. But essentially, that is neo-liberalism, crony capitalism, the force that will ultimately obscure liberal values and human rights. It is the systematic replacement of liberals & protected people with masses slaves. That‚Äôs it. The end goal of neo-liberalism is slavery, and they have the technology to do it, but not quite the will and guts to outright take aggressive action directly for it. All of these things are intwined and there is no wall between what is a political issue vs business issue. \n\n**And I‚Äôm not arguing it‚Äôs a grand conspiracy, it‚Äôs not**, there is no single inner circle of people conspiring, it‚Äôs just the nature of power at work, it‚Äôs multiple sects and many powerful people working their own common interests and justifying what they can get away with and trying not to suffer the grave consequences of rocking the boat. Regardless of whether it is the intent whenever they make a decision, that is effectively what the ruling class is doing. Many of them likely don't even know what this system is heading toward for everyone. People are sheep, even the shepherds. Justification on top of justification buries the truth, even from the liar. It‚Äôs called a **shut-eye** [1:45](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IjPsnfysrp8). Good intentions pave the road to hell.\n\n**I wanted to add more** *about how religions and identity politics and neo-marxism plays into things, how the media is a propaganda machine, and how the media plays both sides of the chess board and essentially plays the role of divide and conquer toward the people who take it willingly and unwittingly, how the media is controlled by (literally 6 families) the same people who actively work to maintain as much control of the government as they can, how the two parties effectively work against all interests of the American people and people of foreign nations, both parties do so in the exact same ways as the other party, how both parties support corporations and banks the exact same ways, some stuff about the environment and food supply and energy industry, how Nixon‚Äôs free trade deal allowed China to sustain itself as a totalitarian state at the expense of the Chinese people and american workers (sorta covered that already), some side notes about Nixon‚Äôs reason for the drug war as well as corporate lobbyists who wanted to crush their the hemp industry competitors, some info about specific weapons deals, info about Saudi Arabia‚Äôs money in the US, some stuff about the\xa0‚ÄúFederal‚Äù Reserve Bank, and some things about the drug war and private prisons and the Clintons in particular, some more things about Reagan‚Äôs similar involvement with these things, the history of our relationship with Saudi Arabia, and specific authoritarian bills that are typically blamed on one party but were passed with a ‚Äòyes‚Äò by Bush, Hillary, and Obama. And on and on and on*, **but I could go on forever**.\n\n**So instead, in short, I‚Äôll just say** that the position of President of the United States has been almost solely a racketeering business for a long time, that social issues are a carrot on a stick leading us this way and that for the interests of someone who does not care how it affects us, and politics are swayed more by a single corporate CEO or former CEO -on a state and federal level- than many entire states combined, especially if we started naming names of specific influential people. And also, things are not all black and white either, there‚Äôs a lot of nuance to all of these issues, and also also, don‚Äôt just take my word for everything or anything.\n\n**Also, on Barack Obama specifically, here is a list of his accomplishments**the:\n\n-He is the first Nobel Peace Prize winner to bomb another Nobel Peace Prize winner\n\n-He is the first US president to bomb a charity hospital, and with 100% collateral damage no less, killing 42, injuring over 30, with 33 people missing. \n\n-He dropped 26,171 bombs in one year, in a war he was elected on the promise of ending\n\n-He is the third president in a row to bomb more nations than any other president since WW2, and was ongoingly bombing all 8 of them at the same time at one point\n\n-He is the 5th president in a row to have increased government debt to a massive new threshold. He raised the government debt from 10 trillion to 20 trillion. Tick tock\n\n-Before presidency, Obama voted ‚Äòyes‚Äô to a bill written by a Bush administrator -who was a former Wall Street banker, btw- written to give themself the authority to spend 700,000,000,000 dollars on banks who were going to fail due to their own illegal business practices that had just destroyed the economy. The banks pocketed most of the money. And don‚Äôt forget the 800 billion dollar stimulus bill on top of that, passed when he made it to office.\n\n-He is the first president to hire a private advertising company as a PR team, yes, he is the first president to have literal propagandists telling him and his circles how to be in order to keep a fals image of who they are to the american people. This is was brought to Hunger Games level on the Orwellian meter when he slowjamed propaganda about how wonderful the TPP is on a late night talkshow. Yes, the TPP, the most imperialistic bill that has every been conceived by corporations (and Hillary Clinton).\n\n[See Video](https://youtu.be/ziwYbVx_-qg)\n\n-Also, first black president, and he didn‚Äôt do shit to help black people, he often made them more upset. And just look at race relations now.\n\nSo yeah, **fuck Obama**. \n\nHe did everything the left hated Bush for. And for some reason, they praise *him* for it when he does it, because politics is fucking football apparently, and football is apparently politics. Did I mention Obama bombed an award winning charity hospital with 100% collateral damage, 0 targets in the building, and people literally burned to death? OH, and fuck me, I actually DIDNT mention the torture that the military is still doing. I‚Äôm just going to end this here for health and mental stability reasons.\n\nRemember, with great power‚Ä¶. comes \n\n**GREAT POWER**"
'Don\'t paste stupid things and I won\'t be forced to defend such an idiot, please.\n\n8 years of war - There wasn\'t a day of the 20th Century when the US wasn\'t involved in a war. From back-channel deals with both sides during the 2nd Boer War to the Philippine-American war to the Greek Civil War and Korea & Vietnam, it\'s ridiculous to criticize him for 8 years of war. *It\'s perfectly legitimate to criticize him for accepting a "Peace Prize" he hadn\'t earned and would essentially devalue.*\n\nIn no way, shape, or form was his presidency the lowest economic growth in US history. Great Depression, anyone?\n\nRecord number of mass shootings - maybe, maybe not. We haven\'t got a lot of good numbers on this historically and what would count, really? Do the atrocities before the Civil War was underway count? What about by and against Native Americans? Shouldn\'t the number of crimes and the number of deaths be compared to the US population to give us a real idea of how bad it has gotten? We don\'t have numbers like that, so making this statement could be accurate - but it could just be misleading since the number of mass killings could simply be a function of population.\n\nFood stamps? The largest percentage jump was 2008 to 2009 - that was W\'s policies. Yes, they continued to grow in numbers through 2013, but then the numbers began to fall. From 2009-10 to 2015-16 the growth was historically low. Further, from the time he took office until he left, the *rate* of people taking food stamps steadily dropped, unlike under W. Now you can say that W dealt with a shitty economy, and that\'s true, but you can\'t lay the food stamps at Obama\'s feet.\n\nHealth insurance - yes, he fucked that up pretty bad, but no, this particular criticism is not really correct, either. The *rate* at which health insurance prices increased was higher under W. No, Obama did not do what he said he\'d do with respect to costs, coverage, etc, but the rate at which insurance costs increased actually went down. Again, you can say W had a bad economy, but you can\'t say that Obama is responsible for the record high costs. \n\nAs for the debt, again, this is not the way to look at it. The rate, yet again, at which the deficit increased dropped under Obama after, yet again, rising under W. The highest percentage change in debt that I can find numbers for was under Reagan, who went from a surplus under Carter to an enormous debt relatively speaking. Obama also presided over the largest GDP in history - again, more a function of time and population than any policy of his - but the GDP to debt growth ratio under Obama was far superior to W.\n\nWorst rioting since 1967 - that\'s extremely subjective, one, and two, that means it\'s not even the worst rioting in living memory. But also we need to consider that there have been riots just about every single year of the 20th century. The Miami riot of 2009 was probably worse than all of the riots under Obama combined. Same could be said of the Cincinnati riots of 2001. There was certainly a lot of rioting under Obama, and IMO it was mostly rioting caused by careless Liberal loud mouths, but I don\'t think the riots were as noteworthy as we think having recently lived through it. Recency bias is a thing.\n\nAs for the poverty rate, that\'s complete garbage. The US poverty rate is not high. It was not high under Obama. It was higher than it had been - yes - but, yet again, the rate at which poverty increased was set under W and decreased and *reversed* under Obama. Further, prior to about ~1965 the poverty rate in the US was something like double what it was under Obama - going all the way back - except when it was *way, way higher*. Again, Great Depression, anyone?\n\n---\n\nBottom line is that Obama was mediocre to slightly above mediocre with the economy compared to historical data, the "Peace Prize" president was mostly status quo - and in many respects more violent than much of our history, there was certainly a notable amount of unrest under his watch - but we can\'t forget that all of the unrest and economic problems ramped up towards the last 1/4th of W\'s presidency. I\'m not saying that it was W\'s fault, either, but that we can\'t say that Obama inheriting a shitty situation and making it slightly better or slightly worse depending on the issue is an indication of how shite he was.\n\nHe did plenty of things that were detrimental to our country, there is no reason and no need to be hyperbolic.'

"Guys, this has nothing to do with Trump or the new tax plan. I worked for Sam's Club and this wage increase was planned years ago. It's also not going to actually help out any of the employees really. \n\nDuring the last round of raises the minimum was bumped up to $9, but if you made more than that you weren't likely to see a raise. This was a sore point for longtime workers who'd started at minimum wage, put years into good reviews to receive incremential raises, just to see completely new people come in and earn the same amount.\n\nIt also diminished the value of the higher paying roles. Folks like meat and deli who made more per hour due to the difficulty of those jobs saw that the pay difference between them and shit like a cart pusher shrunk dramatically. That would bother me specifically, as I only made $11.64/hour in their Level 6 (meat department got paid more than any employee who wasn't a manager or pharmacy tech). At least $0.40 of that was due to positive annual reviews, so were I still working there, the only difference between their lowest and highest job would have been only about $0.40/hour.\n\nFurthermore, they cut hours, eliminated annual review raises (replacing them with a lesser program), cut positions down and put up a hiring freeze. \n\nThen, the worst part: At Sams, you had access to several types ofnpaid leave. Vacation, Paid Tine Off (PTO), and Sick Leave. Holidays weren't considered a part of this, but everyone received those days as well. \n\nFolks were upset that you had to expend vacation and PTO before you could use sick leave. They were also upset that even then, you couldn't use sick leave for the first day of any sickness (to cut down on folks using it to get unscheduled paid days off). \nSo what Walmart did was take away paid holidays, vacation, and PTO. Then they granted you a monthly allotment of paid hours. Those hours could be used more freely, but you got fewer of them, and had to spend them for holidays (if you wanted to be paid for that time).\n\nAll this to say that ANYTHING and EVERYTHING Walmart does has a downside. They will make a show that they are giving you a something while they quietly take from you somewhere else. "
'Walmart is still a disgusting corporation that treats their employees like dog shit. I worked for them as a pharmacist for a short time and it was, without a doubt, the worst experience of my career.\n\nI reported a district manager for belittling, demeaning, and harassing our technicians - whom they also grossly underpaid.'
"I'm sure the libtards who've never worked a day in their life will scoff at $11 an hour, but this is A BIG deal for the people who are affected buy it. \n\nLet's say they were making $8 an hour before the tax bill. With a raise to $11, they're making an extra $3/hr. If you work full time that is an extra $120 a week ($3/hr X 40 hrs = $120/week). If you work 52 weeks a year, that's an extra **$6,240** a year! \n\nThat's a hell of a raise for anyone who's not a CEO or paid speaker for Goldman Sachs. But if you look at the raise *relative* to what they were making before the tax cut, then it's even crazier. $8/hr for 40 hours a week for 52 weeks a year equals a salary of $16,640. The extra $6,240 brings the salary up to $22,880 which equates to about a 38% raise. \n\n**38%**!!!!!!! And it was done without raising the minimum wage and thus hurting companies' bottom lines but by cutting taxes and thus helping companies' bottom lines. Literally everyone is winning from this tax cut. Fuck you CNN for straight up lying to my face and telling me only the rich will benefit. **38%!!!!** you fake news pieces of shit.\n"

'WTF! I hate pay raises now!'
'Did any of these companies ever say, "if you drop the tax rate we\'ll raise wages?" I don\'t recall hearing that once. \n\nFrankly, I\'m a little pissed. One of the few things I agreed with the left was raising the minimum wage. I also think the corporate tax rate should have been lower (unlike them). Whenever I\'d get into an argument with friends, they\'d say, "Those jobs aren\'t worth 15, they should be less, everyone who works them is unmotivated, etc." Not all of them are burger flippers, at the local elementary school, the aides only make 10 an hour being tard wranglers.

'There are few things in life that I am truly passionate about. However, there is one thing that I always love to engage in a heated debate about: why New Jersey sucks. I have a list of reasons a mile long and a rebuttal to anyone‚Äôs pro-Jersey statements. Founded in 1664 from land stolen from New York, Jersey is called the ‚Äúarmpit of America‚Äù for a reason, and I aim to prove why that nickname is so fitting.\n\nWhy is New Jersey called ‚Äúthe Garden State‚Äù? Because they couldn‚Äôt fit ‚ÄúOil and Petrol Refinery State‚Äù on a license plate. Wherever you go, there are refineries, oil derricks and overall filth and stench. While it is true that gas prices in New Jersey are delightfully low, this one positive aspect is greatly offset by the fact that the entire state is one large gas station and consequently smells like fart. \n\nWhat is the difference between Jersey girls and trash? Trash gets picked up. The few places in New Jersey that are not dedicated to furthering this country‚Äôs dependence on oil are reserved for containing garbage. New Jersey has been called ‚ÄúNew York‚Äôs garbage dump‚Äù and referred to as ‚Äúa giant garbage dump with a mess of highways running through it‚Äù. There are more garbage dumps in New Jersey per square mile than any other state in the nation. It‚Äôs disgusting, both to see and to smell. Furthermore, that the smell is worsened by the people of New Jersey themselves. \n\nNew Jersey is full of wanna-be ‚ÄúGuidos‚Äù who regularly bathe themselves in Axe body spray under the false pretense that this will make them smell attractive. Actually, it makes them repulsive. It is absolutely hysterical to observe these guys who think they are the hottest thing since sliced bread. The standard uniform for one of these ‚Äúbros‚Äù consists of tight jeans (often with fancy stitching and/or embroidery) and a striped blue button-down dress shirt with the collar ‚Äúpopped‚Äù. Since when did tanning, tweezing eyebrows, full-body waxing, hair that resembles the aftermath of sticking one‚Äôs finger in an electrical socket and wearing skin-tight women‚Äôs tank tops and lip gloss become ‚Äúmanly‚Äù? These people should be sterilized...\n\nAfter having witnessed such horrifying sights, the standard sane response is to want to flee the state as quickly as possible. However, yet again New Jersey unfailingly demonstrates its suckyness to anyone unfortunate enough to be trapped within its state borders.\n\nMore than likely you‚Äôll get lost as you try to leave, due to the lack of signage and crappy planning of the roads and highways. To make matters worse, left and U-turns are prohibited at most intersections! New Jersey loves its jug handles, forcing drivers to turn right before they can turn left. The argument for this is that the jug handles improve safety by decreasing intersection accidents, but I think they are unnecessary. A left turn lane with a left turn only signal on the traffic light would be sufficient, instead of using up all that extra land. In reality, these jug handles can cause more accidents. What happens when someone is driving along, expecting to turn left but instead at the last minute realizes that they have to get all the way over to the right lane? Accidents and road rage from the annoyance and aggravation, that‚Äôs what happens. It is ironic that despite their ‚Äúsafety conscious‚Äù infrastructure, New Jersey also has the highest auto insurance rates in the country due to frequent accidents and overall crappy drivers.\n\nDuring your incarceration in New Jersey, you‚Äôll most likely eventually have to stop for gas. Here again more Jersey brilliance is encountered: it‚Äôs illegal to pump your own gas. That‚Äôs right, self-service is a crime. While it is understood that this was done to create jobs, the least Jersey could have done was to ensure that these individuals were qualified to fuel a car. Apparently when asked to ‚Äúfill it up with 93-octane‚Äù they interpret this as exactly the same as asking for a tank full of 87. I‚Äôve given up on expecting the gas station attendants to actually listen and comprehend the English language, so now I keep a careful eye on these screw-ups to ensure I get what I ask for. How lovely it is that New Jersey has made it necessary for consumers to supervise them to make sure they actually do their remedial job correctly.\n\nFurthermore, once you actually find your way out of the Garbage State and can practically taste the wonderful freedom of escape, you get yet another slap in the face. For the privilege of leaving New Jersey, you are charged a toll! That‚Äôs right; you are actually required to have to pay to leave. Every exit, every road and every bridge that leaves NJ is sweetened by the process of handing over your hard-earned money.\n\nNow, you‚Äôd assume that this money was being put to good use, but this would be incorrect. Instead of solving problems that plague the state via toll collections, or possibly repairing some of the poorly integrated roads or replacing jughandles, New Jersey continues to sink to a new level of moral and ethical lowness. Per capita, New Jersey is the richest state in the country (with a lot of that money being mafia-related), but the city of Camden is the poorest in the nation with the highest murder and crime rates as well. They should use some of this money to solve these types of problems, but they don‚Äôt, because New Jersey sucks.\n\n‚ÄúJersey Pride‚Äù is another thing that really bothers me. New Jersey has nothing to be proud about, except its stench. They‚Äôre just jealous that they aren‚Äôt as good or as pretty as New York. Proud New Jersey inhabitants often ramble on about why they love their state so much, but since their accents are so painful to listen to, their flawed logic falls on deaf ears. Since when has ‚ÄúJersey‚Äù been spelled ‚ÄúJoisey‚Äù?\n\nAdditionally, Jersey steals. The Jets and the Giants home stadium is located in New Jersey, but they are both New York teams! Even worse is that New Jersey claims to own the Statue of Liberty. The Statue is located on Liberty Island, which is in New York, but due to the fact it is located in close proximity to Jersey City, NJ, they consider it theirs. Thieves I say, blatant thieves.\n\nLastly, after all of these headaches from dealing with the idiocy that is New Jersey, it would only make sense that you‚Äôd want to enjoy a drink or a beer to relax and de-stress. If you want to do that on Sunday though, you‚Äôre out of luck. That‚Äôs right, no alcohol sales on Sunday. This is an absolute travesty, especially during football season. How can they expect sports fans to truly enjoy their games? Damn Jersey...\n\nIn conclusion, I feel there is strong evidence as to why you should hate New Jersey. The state, and most of the people living there, are complete wastes of space. It‚Äôs smelly and gross and completely illogical. The state dance is the square dance. I think that New Jersey sucks, and you should too. '

"shadow banning is a form of fraud,  without question, and the courts will deem it illegal.\n\nTwitter does not notify you that you've been shadow-banned.    And yet when they shadow ban you,  they reduce your access to their services - at the same time they are still telling you that these services are available to you.    People invest a lot of time and money into what they put out through Twitter.   Being shadow banned is a huge loss of revenue for them.    The deception is the key.     \n\nI expect the law will come down hard on Twitter over this..  not to mention the public backlash once the practice becomes common knowledge.   Long term they just can't survive if they don't maintain a non-partial image.   Eventually someone else will depose them."
"It's a big problem.  Twitter/Facebook/YouTube all have algorithms that limit conservative content from being seen.  They all claim these algorithms are meant to stop hate speech and abuse, which gives them cover as they've been extremely aggressive at going after conservatives and they do it in clever ways so that it can be hard or impossible to know exactly what is going on.  It started with Milo and lot of people didn't care so they just targeted more and more people."
'Let me translate for you @Twitter:\n\nNEVER, EVER SHADOWBAN REPUBLICANS AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR CENSORSHIP. BE CAUTIOUS!'
"Where in Twitter's rules does it say they censor all right leaning political posts? It doesn't -- but it should. If Twitter changes it's TOS to include that -- so that it's crystal clear for all users, I think no legal argument could be made as to their shadowban policy. Hell, even right here on the Donald, it's crystal clear in the rules that we don't tolerate non-supporters of Trump."

'Why would it be illegal for Twitter to ban whomever it wants?'
'Shadow banning ?? But they said Trump couldn‚Äôt ban anyone due to ‚Äúfreedom of speech‚Äù\n\n'
'You know I have a sneaking suspicion Facebook does a similar thing. Im not sure if there is a name for it, because it\'s not technically "shadow banning", but it\'s more along the lines of "purposely keeping groups of people within a bubble, so as to create an echo chamber, thereby halting the spread of cancerous conservative speak"...."bubble banning?" Lol. Shit I hope I didn\'t just give Reddit an new idea. Then again, at the end of the day, the people will always have their say, even if it means abandoning all of the "myspace" social media for a new version somewhere else. The control of the flow of information is not a monopoly and there will always be workarounds.\n\nAlso I am also most certainly on some sort of special black list there (facebook), the last time I got banned, it happened within five seconds of hitting the "post" button....it\'s almost as if certain people become marked "in this case, le ebil Nazi conservitive speak", and there post goes directly to the "good guy zuckerberg army of free speech suppression"\n\nWho knows probably this post will get me banned here, I\'m not at all active so no big deal, I get banned from 4chan bitches!!! The funny thing is tho, nobody notices all of the illegal activities I talk about here (reddit) having to do with drugs and whatnot. But God forbid I mention evil Trump Nazi. This is the liberal destruction of America. And I also am caught up in it\'s death grip, but will continue to fight on it\'s behalf wherever I\'m not banned from on that particular day.'

'I would almost say, the negative media is HELPING him.\nMyself for one, as a former democrat I am so disgusted by how bias the media clearly is that I doubt I will ever vote democrat again. All the anti-Trump BS has seriously turned me off. I no longer get any of my news from them and I will vote Republican moving forward. North Korea is at peace with the South, unemployment is low and the media still talks trash? I think he is doing a great job!'

'Stop calling them media. They‚Äôre enemy propaganda agencies. '
"Going through the major news subreddits on this site is a joke too. They've mass banned many people who are critical of the left. And the leftist hivemind upvotes comments that follow their agenda even if it's easy to refute, and they downvote well thought out conservative arguments.

'Only 90% negative? I figured the lying liberal media was at least at 95% negative by now. '
'Anyone listen to NPR. It sickens me their propaganda. They talk so matter of factly in this fake calming tone. I can just tell it lures the leftist dupes in. We pay for it. They would die such a quick death without public funding. In between almost nonstop gender and race talk..they throw underhanded jabs at republicans and the president and have people on that speak in such calm yest vitriolic tones. Its like a propaganda outlet.'
'Media polls negative due to 90% being full of shit. '
"The fact that 90% of the media coverage about President Trump is 'negative' is a disgrace to this country. If the left didn't have Hollywood and their media allies they'd never win a single election. Indoctrination over reality is the name of their game"
'Ironically, largely probably BECAUSE of the negative coverage because the anti-American enemies could not restrain themselves from vomiting their deepest and darkest authoritarian impulses out into the world. '
"Of course it is, it has to. If nothing else people will think more of him simply because (assuming they're not full on CNN kool-aid drinkers) because they can tell the media is riding his ass about EVERYTHING. Combine that with a better economy, the promise/forecast of an even BETTER economy going forward and things like the NoKo prisoners being released today, anyone with any objectivity will see what's going on. And if you're right in the middle, if you see what he's doing combined with the media portrayal, you're going to get tired as fuck of what they're doing."

Of these 27 mass shootings only 9 were committed by white individuals or 33%. This is despite the fact that white individuals make up 70% of the population. If I was trying to write pure shit rather than be a journalist, I could extrapolate an entire article about the deadly rise of Non-White Rage.  \n  \nCNN is disgusting race baiting trash.'
'CNN is racist, plain and simple. We need to fight back.'
'If you call out the fact that most firearm crime is committed by poor, young black men, that makes you a racist, but it\'s perfectly acceptable to write articles on the comparably rare violence of the white devil.\n\nIf we had an honest media, they\'d be wondering aloud why Black Lives Matter isn\'t addressing the absolute epidemic of black on black crime instead of non-stop focusing on multiple law enforcement shootings of black men where the "victim" often was an uncooperative antagonist with a string of priors.

'Oh my god. The language of the left so fucking cucked. "If mass shootings were perpetrated by mostly brown bodies..."\n\nAnd never mind that BY FAR the overwhelming majority of gun violence is perpetrated by blacks. In places like New York and Chicago the racial crime differentials are so one sided that if you subtracted all the crimes committed by whites, you\'d hardly see any drop in crime. \n\n[The Color of Crime](https://2kpcwh2r7phz1nq4jj237m22-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Color-Of-Crime-2016.pdf)\n\nIf New York City were all white, the murder rate would drop by 91 percent, the robbery rate by 81 percent, and the shootings rate by 97 percent.\n\nIn an all\xad-white Chicago, murder would decline 90 percent, rape by 81 percent, and robbery by 90 percent.\n\nIn 2013, of the approximately 660,000 crimes of interracial violence that involved blacks and whites, blacks were the perpetrators 85 percent of the time. This meant a black person was 27 times more likely to attack a white person than vice versa. A Hispanic was eight times more likely to attack a white person than vice versa.\n\nFuck yes empirical facts should serve to minimize Black Lives Matter and claims of racial oppression from black and brown "bodies".'

'The only thing that makes me "rage" as a white man is how it\'s acceptable to write inflammatory racist opinions about white men, and simply stating cold statistics about any other race is hate speech. '
'"raging black men stereotype"\n\nHAHA Anybody who lives in a black city knows this is not a stereotype. This is true. Black males in the US are angry as fuck. Their cities are generally dangerous. You cant go anywhere in a black city without black males mean mugging you\n\nBlack males, 6% of the population commit 50% of murders in the US annually. Yes I would say 1/20th of our population committing 1/2 of our murders means they ARE an angry group of individuals. '

'Interesting thing about [this article](http://archive.is/AwrwD) is how the "273 mass shootings" in 2017 somehow gets whittled down to 36, even under the lower threshold of victims mandated by the FBI.\n\nI guess that number was rather inflated by taking every single shooting where people didn\'t even die and just lumping them all together. '
"So you're saying black on black crime is a problem? No way. *sarcasm*"
'The way they define "mass shootings" is calculated to include as many incidents as possible. A "mass shooting" is not a mass murder. It\'s usually defined as any gun incident where more than one person was injured. So if one person shoots another, and a third person slips and falls and gets hurt in running away, that\'s a "mass shooting." Very, very misleading statistic designed purely for political purposes.'

Confirmation from disinterested third parties that a culture of harassment existed at the organization in question.\n\nThree of these (1,2,4) exist in this case, and there are implications that all four exist.

'Recently met a guy from Oregon. Started to talk politics with him. Of course Trump came up. Swear to God, we joke about it, but as soon as his name was mentioned the guy literally started shaking and could damn near not even spit out a coherent sentence! Until he latched onto the script, you know the one, xenophobic, racist, sexist, .... it was like MSNBC has programmed his mind! Chilling experience honestly.'
'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco_siege\n\nworth the read. \n\n\n> Within a minute of the raid starting, Branch Davidian Wayne Martin called emergency services, pleading for them to stop shooting.[44] The resident asked for a ceasefire, and audiotapes record him saying, "Here they come again!" and, "That\'s them shooting! That\'s not us!"[44]'
"Anyone who is against guns should watch the WACO documentary and read up on what happened. It doesn't matter how you personally feel about the situation (if they should have got into trouble or not), the point is, it's very very clear from WACO everyone needs a way to protect themselves against the government. \n\nThey used attack helicopters and tanks, and shot up a place with children inside, all over a few modified weapons (or so they say). You can watch congress after also, and find full videos of the situation if you don't believe the documentary. Even though the documentary was showed in court, it is reliable. But there is other options ofc. \n\nIt's completely sick, and proves that we should 100% continue to fight to keep guns, and get rid of existing gun laws tbqh. "
"Never forget Waco.  For you pedes who aren't familiar with Waco, do a little research. Janet Reno was Bill Clinton's Attorney General of the United States from 1993 until 2001.  Seventy six (76!) men, women and children were killed.  Some were shot, some were burned to death.  It was horrible."

"A lot of misinformation in this thread.\n\nThe leader of the church in Waco Texas was a murderous self proclaimed prophet who changed his name to match som biblical nonsense. \n\nHe had sex with the wives of other men and made them have his kids. He was illegally manufacturing weapons. The illegal kinds, the kind we are supposed to be against.\n\n\nImagine a black lives matter leader fucking other peoples wives and manufacturing illegal weapons.. you'd want him taken out.\n\n\nHe did not release any of the members of the church, they fought for him and they died.\n\nPolice lives were lost fighting a deranged terrorist. He fled to a basement and locked himself and the children there where they burned because of an accident fire from the madness that ensued.\n\n\nIt wasn't some evil government killing Christians, it was an evil man who had a crazy church that manufactured illegal weapons who got himself and a lot of people killed including cops.\n\n\nDon't pretend to care about blue lives of you support the terrorists at Waco.\n"

We tell people to just comply with the police when they encounter them and they will avoid trouble, solve it in the courts.\n\nDavid Koresh thought he was the second coming of Jesus (spoiler alert: he wasn't) He would annul the marriages of any Branch Davidian members and had the sole privilege of having sex with all of the women.\n\nYES, what happened to those kids was awful, the feds fucked up, but let's not absolve the monsters in the Branch Davidian cult who killed those federal agents.

"Last week was a terrible week for the Clinton Cabal, Mueller, and most of D.C. Just then, *charges filed*! It's Manafort. And the news was leaked *specifically* to VFNN in order to distract and dominate news headlines. \n\nI hope to be proven wrong, but this appears to be exactly what was expected when it first started: A sham witch hunt designed to hide criminality from D.C. swamp creatures while simultaneously being slow-rolled to dominate headlines through the 2018 and 2020 election cycles ... All of this at taxpayer expense. \n\nI say again: it's a *fucking miracle* we're not in the middle of an armed revolution. We are taxed on everything and our own bloody fucking taxes go towards lavish lifestyles of politicians and towards covering criminal enterprises."

"Why is cnbc so stupid? Why are they doubling down again like this proves that they are right all along? What does this have to do with Donald trump colluding with Russia and rigging the election? They spent 10 months looking for a crime. This was the best they could do and once again it's someone with dnc swamp ties. "
"Headline of the article:\n\n> **Former Trump campaign chairman** Paul Manafort indicted as part of **Russia election probe**\n\nTypical obfuscation from the leftist media.\n\n> It was unclear early Monday morning what charges had been filed against Manafort and Gates, but the indictments by a federal grand jury mark the start of a new phase in the special counsel's investigation into Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. \n\nWe all know what the charges will be and it will have nothing to do with the election at all but to do with his past dealings with Russia. However, watch the leftist sheeples spin this into the end of Drumpf and how he will be impeached. \n\n> Trump has adopted a tone of defiance in public. However, inside the White House, nearly all of Trump's top aides, and the president himself, have hired outside lawyers to represent them in the probe ‚Äî a sign of how serious the situation is for the West Wing.\n\nNo shit! It's called self defense. When you have people making up charges and investigating the fake charge, what will you do? "
"As predicted here in TD, no mention of the fact that Manafort's dealing with Russia happened while he worked for the Podestas. Shameful dishonest coverage, but it's what we're used to."
'The mainstream media is gonna say a former Trump staffer was arrested. I doubt they mention that he worked for podesta'
'Worst kept secret'
'...he was indicted for something that had 1) nothing to do with the election, 2) nothing to do with Russia,  3) noting to do with medaling, and 4) was investigated by the FBI at the time but no charges. \n\nClassic definition of a witch hunt. \n'
'Now the dems are fucked so they pushed Mueller to produce something to flip the narrative., so the only guy that both sides can sacrifice is Manafort. He probably knows too much about the Podestas. He was just doing his job in Ukraine as he said during the primaries. '

'I like Charles Barkley. My ancestors fought in the civil war (south) and the revolutionary war. I don\'t give a damn about any statues or the confederacy. They created a huge problem with slavery and they knew it. Read history. The revolts, the fear of revolts. What an insane way to live.\n\nThen, they kicked the problem down the generation line with the jim crow laws or "slavery light". Today\'s politicians are doing the same with all the finger pointing and no action.\n\nIn a 100 years they\'ll still be having race riots, ghettos, minority schools will still be piles of shit and people will culturally glorify remaining useless to the economy. I\'m sure future generations will curse this one for not having the guts to tackle the problem. Just like I curse my ancestors for creating it. '
'If you quizzed these folks about who the statues are and what they did, how many of them would actually pass? \n\nSpoiler Alert! PGT Beauregard, one of the "racist statues" removed in NOLA, was a HUGE proponent of civil and voting rights for slaves after the Civil War. So, Ironically, by tearing down that statue these morons advocated for tearing down one of the biggest early supporters of African Americans in postbellum America. Fucking shame. '
'This is nothing but a campaign by privileged college students to ameliorate their own guilt about inequality. Slavery is evil. How about focusing your energy on ending modern slavery? How about you focus on building up some monuments to heros? Abolitionists? Great ideas?'
'Of course they are irrelevant, thats why u didnt see these alt left rioters bring up once in the last 8 years, hell even the last 20 years this was never an issue. Its a concentrated effort to further divide the country'
'It\'s not about statues, it\'s not even about the history of slavery, it\'s not even about the place of blacks in America. \n\nIt\'s about inciting civil unrest, it\'s about the globalist lefts need to continue feeding their useful idiots emotional need for victimhood. It\'s about forcing so much violence our rights have to be drained away under the guise of "public safety". \n\nIt worked in Russia in 1918, it worked in Germany in the 1930s, it worked in China in the 50s, and it\'s working in western Europe today. \n\nIt can\'t work in America until the 2nd Amendment is usurped. That won\'t happen until someone like Hillary Clinton or Elizabeth Warren finds themselves in a position to appoint the supreme courts majority. Or until the average American gets so tired of the endless violence that they just give in. \n\nDon\'t be a useful idiot.'
"ZACKLY. No one is making anyone worship these things, or even notice them. If we want to hold every symbol accountable for what people did in its name, or every artifact linked to people who did bad things, you'd have no religions left, no governments left, no organizations left, nothing. "
'To some degree, they are trolling us because honestly I don\'t give a fuck about the statues either. What I give a fuck about is this slow creep into history revision and them trying to control speech and thought by misusing and abusing words like "racism". Then there\'s the accusations of Nazism, which is so common and absurd it\'s literally considered a logical fallacy.'

Fake News only gives attention to fringe groups to make it seem like we\'re descending into civil war. Most people on both sides agree that MSM is shit and they\'re using up all of their moves. Sad. '
"This is quite interesting from a South African's view point.  After the 1994 election and the ANC came into power the government spend billions on taking down statues and even renaming streets. So much money that could have been put to good use for improving the education system, hospitals, roads. In this case the millenial blacks can't be bothered by streets bearing names of apartheid-regime people but the older folks just can't let go of the past.  Sad to see parts of a country's history get destroyed.  Let's face it, each country's history has a part which people want to forget and obliterate all evidence of that period.  "
"Nothing but charles. Seriously, I'm black and could care less about these statues. The guys are long dead and slavery was abolished in the US nearly 150 years ago. Tearing them down accomplishes nothing."

Disgusting.\n"
'Cornball brother!!\n\nThat is what Rob Parker would call him. '
"The confederate statues aren't the only target, all statues that resemble American history are the target. The left wing, or alt-left, have had the purge of whiteness on their agenda for years. They are trying to purge white culture from American History because they view whiteness as inherently racist, even though most members of this ideology are themselves white people. This movement's roots can be traced back to the revisionist Marxists of the 1960s and 1970s."
'The news media has actually caused hate groups membership on both sides to massively spike.  Groups that were dying out a slow death now threaten to make a comeback.'
"I mean, one side had someone kill and injure the other, so I would argue they deserve blame. \n\nOne side killed another. That's worse, in my eyes. \n\nViolence should not be the answer to be heard, whether you feel oppressed or not. "

'As a blackspanic female, Antifa is far worse than the American Nazi Party. \n\nOne group has been for the most part a silent group of old white dude reliving the glory days, and the other a terrorist group that kills cops, right wingers, and centrists alike.\n\nAntifa is so much worse.'
"I was at trump tower today counter protesting leftists- not cucked at all. I think what trump said and what he meant are two different things. Obvi he's not a nazi or racist, but the media will spin what he said word by word as they've been doing from day one. I just think it's unfair to compare nazis and KKK members (as few as they are) to the people on Antifa. Both awful, I just think the nazis are worse based on their history. The only thing worse than communism and socialism is nazism. "
'Only one side murdered a fellow American! '
"Yes they are, but what happened Saturday was that a neo nazi killed someone. If Antifa killed someone I'd be saying the same thing. Neo-nazis, antifa, the KKK and radical Muslims- all wrong and should be condemned when they commit acts of terror. "
"Believe me I fully support trump. I was at trump tower last night counter protesting. I just think it's wrong for people on T_D to try and defend the KKK and neo nazis, or equivocate them to other organizations that don't have a 150 year long history of hate and racism. "
'They\'re both bad, but the one called for extermination and a "white race" the other was just a crazed murderer. '
'Still not equivalent to the extent of the nazi regime. 12 million murdered in camps, millions more in battle. You know a whole world war '
'Back when no one gave a shit about white supremacist assholes, things were great. They rarely made it into the mainstream. Their numbers were low. They were dying out. I knew of only a couple in the small rural mostly-white town I grew up in, and they were made fun of.\n\nBut then suddenly these SJW assholes started hating on white people in the name of "social justice" which caused a lot of white people to suddenly think "wtf, why are you calling me racist? you want to do -what- to me? I was on your side but fuck you".\n\nSuddenly the amount of white nationalists skyrockets. And the SJWs act surprised.\n\nWhy do these people not realize that their identity politics are marginalizing a whole large chunk of people, and making the situation worse?'
"That's what makes me so sad. Is by ignoring the fact that identity politics and violence on the left only gives credence to what these asshole identity politics on the right are doing. They have the wrong answers to legitimate concerns like immigration and economic struggles, as well as the growing sentiment of anti-whiteness that's growing in America. By not condemning violence on both sides, it only serves to bolster antifas confidence and white nationalists numbers. They will make the Nazis they claim to hate. I weeping for my nation right now. When the right to civil discourse dies violence is the only outlet left to express oneself. And if it comes to that, either the Nazis or the Communists will win and the experiment that was the greatest country ever will end in tyranny. "

'Ok but what about all the "anti-racism" (ie, racist) protesters that showed up and beat people? Like sure, one guy ran over some people with his car, does that excuse the violence committed by the side that had members run over?\n\nYou can find both actions disgusting. In fact, you should. No one should have been run over. No one should have been beaten. The media presenting this as racists vs anti-racists is disingenuous, its 2 racist groups clashing and someone died. That death doesnt make either side more right, it makes both sides even dumber.'
'"Liberals" dont understand free speech because they dont understand consequences. Its impossible to them that their ideas will ever be in the minority and the restrictions they call for might be applied to them. I say "liberals" because these arent real liberals, theyre fascists in disguise. '
"Still too many of us. Soros tries hard, but often makes huge mistakes. I think they have jumped the gun because they are all getting old and they want a success before they die. Their dream to be the rulers is pushing their narrative prematurely.  They have little military backup and a few messed up kids willing to hit people in a riot aren't what it takes to conquer a huge nation full of adults and ex-military veterans."
"At this event. What about the shot Republicans? What about the dead committeeman? \n\nLet's not pretend like political violence hasn't been escalating for the last few months. Let's not pretend like the *vast majority* of political violence has been coming from one side. Now one person dies and suddenly the right get all the blame?\n\nFuck that.\n\nYou can't pull the wool over the eyes of people who've been watching what's been happening for the last half year. I condemn violence, but I have eyes and can see what's going on. "

'lol, it wouldn\'t be much different if nobody died, because we\'ve been trained to recoil at the name "nazi", but not at communism/Stalin.  \n\nThe "protesters" (thugs who wanted to remove the First Amendment rights of the neo nazis) would have still maced, thrown acid, thrown piss and feces, and still beat the neonazi dorks with baseball bats.  It\'s fucked up, honestly.  It would be like if a bunch of rednecks went to some kind of Islamic demonstration with fucking baseball bats, mace, piss and feces in bottles, concrete in bottles, and then screamed and shouted at the Muslims and then began assaulting them.  Dude, American‚Äôs mustn‚Äôt fucking treat fellow American‚Äôs that way unless it is in self defense.  We all have a right to ideologies we choose.  And we have a right to assemble and talk about it.  Let none of use take that right from another.\n'
'and the other side was literally waving communist soviet flags.  Who killed more, Stalin or Hitler?  Antifa is a real threat.  NeoNazidorks are not a real threat to destabilizing the nation.  Antifa literally wants to remove our current government and establish a communist state.  Neodorkziiis just want to hate colored people...more evil in ideology, but less of a real threat, imho.'
"Agreed. Hate Antifa and KKK and neo nazis, but this time the nazis killed someone, therefore in this instance are worse. Idk why some people are still here defending them. If you're a KKK member of nazi, GTFO T_D"
"Yes the KKK has become more or less irrelevant, but its supporters latch onto what the don says because the media tells them he is racist. They're stupid and are controlled by the media narrative just as much as the left. Since they believe he is racist, they follow him. So then we must denounce their hatred and neo nazis everywhere. "
'Communism is WAY worse in practice, it just *sounds* better *in theory*!! Way more people have died under communism!!  Go look at the actual numbers of how many of their own Nazi\'s killed.  Then look at Stalin.  Remember too Germany was basically fighting for their survival against communism.  Hell, fucking WWII basically started with the Bolshevik uprising, and then with Germans getting killed in Poland (the area which was German land, prior to WWI reparations).  We won WWII, so we got to say all the great things we wanted, and say how bad Hitler was.  That\'s why now we equate the worst thing ever as "literally Hitler".  Really fucking Stalin was the worst ever.'

Also, doesn't look like the police station was wiped out, it was damaged and will need some repair, but far from destroyed.

'Having lived in Norway for longer than I care to admit, there are a **lot** of things the media blacks out when it comes to immigrants.  Like for example, rapes, murders and robberies?  For the most part, unless it\'s extremely heinous, they leave ethnicity / immigration status out.\n\nI have so many stories to tell, but I\'ll leave you with these two:\n\nMy friend (also American), was in town running some errands.  This was in broad daylight.  He walked between two buildings (a major walk-way) where two Somali "youths" (young adults, 18-20) jumped out and tried to rob him at knife point.  Keyword: Tried.  He served in Afghanistan / Iraq and has no time for idiocy.  News next day: "Two youths rob man in daylight".\n\nI had two Norwegian friends, a couple, stand outside a bar taking a smoke.  Neither were inebriated in the slightest, just out to grab a couple of beers together and meet up with some friends.  A group of Somali\'s approach the man, ask him for a cigarette.  Not having any more, he declined them one and that\'s when they both were assaulted and placed in the hospital.  The man had a broken rib and other injuries.  News: "A drunken fight happened outside (club name) Saturday night severely injuring one".\n\nFor the last, and most fucked up:  A Middle Eastern child and a Norwegian child were playing together.  They had a disagreement where the M.E. kid ran inside crying to his dad.  The dad, mid-late 40\'s comes out side and starts beating on the Norwegian boy.  Numerous people jump in to help the boy out and to call the police.\n\nThe man wasn\'t charged with anything, he was told to go back inside and not to come out for the remainder of the day with his son.  This was witnessed by my girlfriend and her sister first hand.  Her sister was even "interviewed" by the local media.  Nothing reported on the case anywhere.\n\nMy point is:  So much happens that the little we do get to know is usually "white washed".  If more people knew the reality of what\'s going on, I think they\'d have a totally different view of immigration as a whole.'

"McCain was horrendously racist when he ran for president in 2008. Off the top of my head, I can't remember him denouncing the KKK or Neo-Nazis even ONCE during his campaign, let alone multiple times per speech as he ought to have. And given that he was running in the election against an African-American, I think his failure to denounce white racism at least a dozen times each day was especially insensitive, and indicative of a deeper white supremacist agenda."

'I thought asylum was for war torn countries ? Are bombs being dropped in mexico ?'
"Here's my take on the Wall. It's not a bad idea. But I actually think it's very misguided. It's a passive response to an aggressive action. \n\nThe responsibility for drugs (and people) coming into the United States rests squarely not on the cartels but ON THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT. They are de facto allowing the cartels through corruption and influence to cross the border and poison and addict millions of Americans. Mexican officials, including former President Vincente Fox and current representatives of the Mexican government are playing it off (for the suckers in the United States, including the Trump administration, sorry) that America is the bad guy and poor Mexico are the victims. It's a con job. \n\nThe Mexican government is corrupted like a rotten apple taking for themselves and leaving the common people out in the cold.  And then those poor people have nowhere else to go except to escape. \n\nThe United States and the Trump administration need to take direct action. The Mexican government allowing cartels to do business unhindered is an act of war against the US. Or at the very least an act of terrorism against us. And against their own common people.\n\nWe really need to take direct military action against the cartels directly (drones, etc). And against anyone in the Mexican government who allows the cartels to run. \n\nInstead of trying to build a wall to stop the drugs. Destroy the cartels and bomb Mexico until the Mexican government does what THEY'RE supposed to do. Eliminate crime in their own country. \n\nedit. tl/dr bomb Mexico. "
'So either they\'re violating international law . . . or Mexico shouldn\'t be recognized as a "safe" country and we should be protecting our borders anyway.\n\nThere is no situation in which we pedes can "lose" from a moral standpoint on this.'
'> You must apply for asylum in the first safe country you wander into. \n\nNot necessarily.\n\nThe treaties the US is a party to *require* nations to ignore illegal entry, as long as you come directly from a country in which you were not safe.\n\nIf you come to the US from Central America and enter illegally, you can still apply for Asylum, but the US can also throw you in prison for illegal entry.'
'The argument they‚Äôve given me is that we should ‚Äúabsorb‚Äù Mexico and make it safe and prosper. ü§£ So they want a military intervention aka war with another country. These people are insane and hypocrites. '
"Mexicans don't want them taking their jobs in mexico either.  It's not like humans stop being human south of the border.

They think we have forgotten that Obama not only did not condemn these acts of racial hostility and violence but even went so far as having a meeting with the very same racist group/movement that began to perpetrate these heinous and evil lies! \n\nIncisive and hatred-filled bigoted remarks like "The white house of supremacy" by Maxine Waters or claiming an entire group of people are fans of white supremacy or white power is what lead to these destructive agents of chaos do what they did.

No sarcasm whatsoever.\n\nHowever, I don\'t think either is "wrong" for staying out of specifics but coming down against violence in all forms.\n\nJust because they didn\'t get precise as you would like on the specific aspect that you would like, is no reason to make any sort of accusation of association, the way a lot of the left is doing.\n\nThere are 7 billion people on this planet, at least *a few of them* will express sadness or anger or otherwise condemn violent happenings in ways that are different from how you would personally want to address it..  Get used to it, because it is not going to change.\n\nEdit:  This is another example of why they tend to conform to Group-think and want everyone to conform or face consequences as well.  This is a disturbing environment that quickly fosters authoritarianism and even tyranny.\n\nThe point:  Trump chose different words than I would have, but he did address issues.  I\'m not all butthurt because I wanted him to say something else.  You can\'t expect the POTUS to pander to all ~316 millions of US citizens, as that would lead to a lot of empty meaningless pandering.(Helllooooo Bernie Sanders branded socialism).\n\nPoliticians are *always* giving such statements that stay out of the thick of it, and they always will, because even now when they *don\'t* they\'re still pissing people off, because people are irrational.  Coming down in a way that is understandable universally, and should be accepted by most when judged on it\'s own merit(eg "violence is bad" because it really is in most cases) *IS* more presidential than most of his detractors would like to admit.  For some, that fact burns ever more deeply than it would if Trump had just said something stupid(the way Bush Jr. did a lot of the time).'

"Islam is the greatest killer of all time, worse than Christianity, fascism or communism. Islamic jihad destroyed a Christian Middle East and a Christian North Africa. Soon it was the fate of the Persian Zoroastrian and the Hindu to be the victims of jihad. The history of political Islam is the destruction of Christianity in the Middle East, Egypt, Turkey and North Africa. Half of Christianity was lost. Before Islam, North Africa was the southern part of Europe (part of the Roman Empire). Around 60 million Christians were slaughtered during the jihadic conquest. Half of the glorious Hindu civilization was annihilated and 80 million Hindus killed. The first Western Buddhists were the Greeks descended from Alexander the Great's army in what is now Afghanistan. Jihad destroyed all of Buddhism along the silk route. About 10 million Buddhists died. The conquest of Buddhism is the practical result of pacifism. Zoroastrianism was eliminated from Persia. The Jews became permanent dhimmis throughout Islam. In Africa over 120 million Christians and animists have died over the last 1400 years of jihad. Approximately 270 million nonbelievers died over the last 1400 years for the glory of political Islam. These are the Tears of Jihad which are not taught in any school.\n\n\nThese figures are a rough estimate of the death of non-Muslims by the political act of jihad.\n\n\nAfrica\n\n\nThomas Sowell [Thomas Sowell, Race and Culture, BasicBooks, 1994, p. 188] estimates that 11 million slaves were shipped across the Atlantic and 14 million were sent to the Islamic nations of North Africa and the Middle East. For every slave captured many others died. Estimates of this collateral damage vary. The renowned missionary David Livingstone estimated that for every slave who reached a plantation, five others were killed in the initial raid or died of illness and privation on the forced march.[Woman‚Äôs Presbyterian Board of Missions, David Livingstone, p. 62, 1888] Those who were left behind were the very young, the weak, the sick and the old. These soon died since the main providers had been killed or enslaved. So, for 25 million slaves delivered to the market, we have an estimated death of about 120 million people. Islam ran the wholesale slave trade in Africa.\n\n\n120 million Africans\n\n\nChristians\n\n\nThe number of Christians martyred by Islam is 9 million [David B. Barrett, Todd M. Johnson, World Christian Trends AD 30-AD 2200, William Carey Library, 2001, p. 230, table 4-10] . A rough estimate by Raphael Moore in History of Asia Minor is that another 50 million died in wars by jihad. So counting the million African Christians killed in the 20th century we have:\n\n\n60 million Christians\n\n\nHindus\n\n\nKoenard Elst in Negationism in India gives an estimate of 80 million Hindus killed in the total jihad against India. [Koenard Elst, Negationism in India, Voice of India, New Delhi, 2002, pg. 34.] The country of India today is only half the size of ancient India, due to jihad. The mountains near India are called the Hindu Kush, meaning the ‚Äúfuneral pyre of the Hindus.‚Äù\n\n\n80 million Hindus\n\n\nBuddhists\n\n\nBuddhists do not keep up with the history of war. Keep in mind that in jihad only Christians and Jews were allowed to survive as dhimmis (servants to Islam) everyone else had to convert or die. Jihad killed the Buddhists in Turkey, Afghanistan, along the Silk Route, and in India. The total is roughly 10 million. [David B. Barrett, Todd M. Johnson, World Christian Trends AD 30-AD 2200, William Carey Library, 2001, p. 230, table 4-1.]\n\n\n10 million Buddhists\n\n\nJews\n\n\nOddly enough there were not enough Jews killed in jihad to significantly affect the totals of the Great Annihilation. The jihad in Arabia was 100 percent effective, but the numbers were in the thousands, not millions. After that, the Jews submitted and became the dhimmis (servants and second class citizens) of Islam and did not have geographic political power.\n\n\nThis gives a rough estimate of 270 million killed by jihad.

'I guess even POTUS doesn‚Äôt have the right to fire his employees when they are not doing the job the way they are expected. Last time I checked, POTUS could fire APPOINTED positions just because they wore the wrong colored socks. POTUS should in no way answer ANY questions on this. Has nothing to do with the scope of investigation since Special Council appointment negates any attempt to impede an investigation if that was reason. Rosenstein should be recusing himself from any activity since there is plenty of evidence of wrong doing on his part earlier in this whole process.  And Congress needs to get the hell out of having people come in or terminate the Special Council. There should be one investigation with Special Council giving weekly report, with very specific details, to Congress. '

'I\'m becoming increasingly sure that Leftists should really stop weighing in on serious, adult situations and stick to serving me coffee, making art, being social media gurus (lol) and all the other frivolous jobs they get into to avoid doing anything difficult or uncomfortable or tangibly important to society. I live in a hugely hipster inner city neighborhood. *Everyone* I hear talk about politics do so from the standpoint of virtue signaling social bs. They don\'t care at all about anything more complex or important. And it\'s almost 100% Marxist opinions on those social issues. Everything they want costs us exorbitant amounts of money, and they never check to see how much when demanding they get their entitlements. Just give them free things. Nothing they want ever seems to actually increase production or up our GDP. Everything is framed around race or gender. The rich are evil. The poor are heroes. Conservatives, while being famous for basically just wanting to be left alone and unfucked-with by the federal government are somehow E V I L. They\'ve learned nothing from the 20th century and they will lead us down a road to true tyranny, as the Leftists in that era did over and over again. \n\nThey refuse to serve their country in any respect, or attempt to understand and respect basic economics, foreign policy, and have never read the Koran or Hadith (or even the Bible for that matter) and would *never* go to a Muslim-majority country but want to import them by the millions anyway. Most don\'t have kids or own homes and pay property tax but want a say as if they have equal skin in the game. If anything, they are kids themselves, even up into their 40\'s. Their opinions are those of narcissistic people in prolonged adolescence. And they hate their own country. It\'s embarrassing and disastrous. We have a democracy more or less, but I just don\'t think these kinds of people have opinions that count. They aren\'t actually responsible or moral people. It seems that practically *everything* they want would leave us weaker or poorer than where we started. \n\nI currently trust the opinions of the most stereotypical "deplorable" redneck on the *nature of reality* far more than I do some city-dwelling hipster with a master\'s degree, and that\'s not a place I ever thought I\'d be.

"Vox, like many of these, lack the skills necessary to discuss the topics they purport to discuss. IF this attack was politically motivated, then it is the textbook definition of terrorism. IF this attack was politically motivated, then it is different than Columbine in which there were no politics involved - where you have what's classified as a mass shooting. \n\nThat said, IF this is deemed a terrorist attack, then Vox needs to lay out the facts and look it over before coming to the conclusion they've jumped to in this article. Muslim foreigners are coming over from a region that's been at war with itself and its people for time immemorial. The constant warfare, and rampant inbreeding, provided fertile soil for a violent ideology whose adherents largely do not challenge its violent tenets. That does not mean that ALL Muslim foreigners are violent radicals, it simply means there's a higher chance that you will find them among the foreigners.\n\nThe close-mindedness that has continually fostered the propagation of violent Islamic terror is a far larger threat when you consider that whole countries etc are under its sway in some form or fashion. Compared to the odd mass shooting you have stateside.\n\nIn short, Vox is jumping to conclusion with an inflammatory title designed to generate clicks and profits."
'Lets see recently we had a black muslim kill 4 whites in Fresno, a black muslim guy on a shooting rampage in Mississippi, a black serial killer taking out 5 white guys on nature trails in Kansas city and a black foreigner shooting up a mostly white church.

'More people are killed from Islamic terrorism than a few angry white men.\n\nThe justification for the myth that libs spread about white men being a greater threat is that libs classify anything from a handful of people being killed to property damage as \'right-wing terrorism\' (unless he\'s a blatant lib, in which case it\'s just news). What they don\'t tell people is that the kill count is far greater in cases of Islamic terrorism.\n\nGeneral \'domestic terrorism\' is more frequent among Americans in America because, er, er, it\'s majority American - shocker, I know; but the kill count has been nowhere near that of Muslims.\n\nUntil this, of course, which is how they justify the article. They say "But in the eight months since Trump took office, more Americans have been killed in attacks by white American men with no connection to Islam than by Muslim terrorists or foreigners.", yet ISIS has claimed the guy as one of theirs.\n\nSecondly, though officially it\'s now some 64 year old white guy that died in a hotel, before it was said to be some \'Asian\' \n\nI really suspect the 64 year old white guy is a scapegoat and there\'s a wider coverup here.'
'Because we dont let the assholes in. Look at the constant acid attacks, stabbings, and trucks of peace all across Europe. \n\nFurthermore, that title has some pretty extreme qualifiers. domestic terrorists... so that excludes all the other terrorists around the world. muslim foreigners... so we are not counting any muslims living here either.  \n\nSo white america men make up around 100 million people in this country and about 3 million muslims (including those living here which are the VAST majority) not just the foreigners. \n\n#And somehow there is even a conversation that they could be more??? There are 33 times more white men than muslims in this country and even with the crazy qualifiers it is close. \n\n#That is like saying a muslim is 33 times more likely than a white man to be a domestic terrorist threat lol. \n\nNice work vox.

Heroes wearing black, waving nazi German flags to wage war on... Nazis...\n\nThey call themselves AntiFA! Anti fascism! Shutting down fascism by silencing anyone who doesn\'t agree with them, like a fascist might do! \n\nThey have no central ideology, no mission statement, no leadership, but they have an enormous wealth of resources for travel, recruiting others for paid "mercenary" work, as long as they can get their own ride. \n\nThis is AntiFA! A cryptically pointless troupe, fighting a nonexistent enemy, funded by an invisible source, with weapons eqivalent to a chimpanzee, throwing their own excrement around and threatening people with violence, in the name of being anti fascism. \n\nIt\'s not so much a civil rights demonstration as it is some kind of scat fetishist mosh pit with no music, and packed lunchables.

'Dems got their bluff called. They are fucked now.'
"Trump offered 1.8 million illegal aliens a reprieve from deportation and a pathway to citizenship, and the Dems turned their noses up at it because it would have required funding for border security as part of the bargain. Proving that Democrats don't actually care about the ~2 million illegal aliens already in the country; what's more import to them are the untold millions of Democrat-voting illegals-to-be who haven't hopped the border yet."
"Last but not least, the loudest of the DACA people don't care either. All they've done is bitched and protested about the deal wanting no strings attached. Shame on them, for being greedy.\n"
'Pedes, can someone please bring me upto speed on DACA? I mean I already died from withdrawing from the Paris Accord and then was revived and murdered again by the tax cuts.\n\nWill ending DACA kill me again? Thanks for help.'
"As a Tax paying Business owner who employs Americans and as a DACA recipient my self, the dems really threw me under the bus I don't know any DACA recipient who would vote democratic if they become a citizen its not gonna happen. They have a chance to help us and President Trump wants to personally help us become legal but democrats are too anti Trump even for something they always said they wanted. I'm sick to my stomach over the actions of the dems"
'Forgive my ignorance, but I thought the Dems desperately wanted it so they could keep the vote of the illegals. What exactly will they draw votes from in 2020? Or are they looking into completely illegal ways to puff up their vote count?'
'They don‚Äôt want a deal.  They want the screaming of women and wailing of children.  They want the suicides and self harm, the last stands and shootouts,  all the while with the MSM taking directions and racing from one event to the next to catch it all on film.  My country has faced similar tactics with fake refugees.  Once deported, the DACAs will scream and hunger strike and self harm at the chain link fence for the cameras.  They will setup a tent city at the border and never leave, and seek some kind of one of a kind special status with the UN.  Crime will be high as they prey one another and the local criminal element moves in to take advantage of them.  Mexican atrocities will take place in the shadow of the wall and they will blame no one but the U.S'
"Let's start thinking about what to do with these people after they are deported back to their homes.   For the DACAs who renounce and disavow illegal immigration, there should be an assistance aide program to help them get them on their feet.   For the DACAs who bold face advocate illegal immigration, we should treat them as war criminals/invaders.  "
'The deadline is here, time to deport them because the Dems failed to come to the table. Democrats in the senate need to learn to fear this president so they never blow him off like this again.'
"Lemme get this straight...\n\nDACA is a safety net for people who were brought here as kids with illegal parents. There is currently no path to citizenship (what about the military?) so these folks are stuck.\n\nMr. Trump wants to either deport or create a pathway to citizenship for these people, but the Dems don't want to help?\n\nIf that's the jist of things, then what the fuck?? *Kids* were being fucked over by short-sighted policy and now there's nothing they can do besides leave the US. And the Dems don't want to do anything because 1) they hate Trump and 2) they tell the DACA kids they'll provide a pathway to garner votes. Now when they're being told to put money where mouth is they don't want anything to do with it."
'Trump is pushing for DACA and the democrats are fighting it.\n\nWhat the hell kind of timeline is this anyway?'
"Of course they don't care. They were simply grandstanding for some 2018 mid term votes. They realized that DACA doesn't really motivate LEGAL VOTING latinos, only stir up the small vocal minority of white students. "
"The rats don't care about the illegal they only use them as a political weapon to get votes. Remember when President Obama held literally all the power and they didn't get shit done for the illegal. I'm telling you folks the rats don't GIVE a shit about anyone except for their dam pockets. "
"Let's just end it. Fuck illegals and fuck anyone who helps them. "
"I would argue stuff like this is intentional. Symbolic. And psychological.\n\nThat doesn't mean they're making the homeless poop in the streets, or that anyone in particular is aware of the symbolism, or aware of its effects on popular psychology.\n\nIt means they've configured the system such that the natural behavior of people acting RATIONALLY in their own self-interest produces, on the aggregate: ruined cities, ugly landscapes, shitty art, artificial relationships, isolation and ruination, everywhere you look. This is the expression, in the material realm, of the ideology of nihilism and despair. Everything starts as an idea. Then as humans we have the agency to give that idea a physical reality. The ugliness in our society is an intentional formalization of that process, carried out over many years, by people as different from you and me as dinosaurs are from dogs."
"San Francisco was my red pill. I only lived there for 6 months, but it was the most disgusting place I've ever lived or visited in my life.\n\nIt provided me a first hand education on what virtue signaling was before knowing it had a name. The average person there does not give a damn about the homeless. They're too busy drinking their $8 chai, $12 avocado toast, and working too many hours to pay for their $3000/mo 1 bedroom apartment. They just walk past blocks of people covered in their own shit, ignore them, and let someone else deal with it."

'Ahhh yes. San Francisco. An old friend and lifelong cuck and his wife invited me to stay at his place in San Francisco. They atually lived in a dump in Oakland which they both could barely afford. The smell of shit was noticable basically everywhere we went. We took the metro into the city and got drunk. His wife yelled at me the whole night about politics, got in my face, and was generally rude and awful. The guy did nothing about it. There were points where he agreed with me, but wouldn\'t say it. I was their guest and they were so disrespectful and ridiculous the whole time. Since then, they have moved to Mexico. They are so "open minded" their brains have fallen out of their head. They moved to a dangerous country because they can\'t afford liberal policies and are somehow still liberal. We are no longer friends.'

Do we outlaw both guns AND human drivable cars?!\n\nGranted, the typical liberal argument (‚Äúmy‚Äù side, mind you) is a bit more subtle than that; no, we don‚Äôt outlaw human drivable cars, but maybe top fuel dragsters shouldn‚Äôt be legal on city streets. The drag strip, sure, drive all you want. If you kill yourself, that‚Äôs too bad, but you knew the risks.\n\nBegs the question: maybe gun restrictions should be taken tighter in cities (but not outlawed), but you live and use the gun in a rural area with a population density where cows out number people 100:1? Sure, you can have a 16inch naval gun. I don‚Äôt care.\n\nAnd yes, that won‚Äôt stop people from having a gun legally in a rural area from taking something like that to a city, but what keeps top fuel dragsters of city streets now?

Switching everything to Apple didn't exactly stop all the attacks but it seemed like only outdated devices popped up with obvious signs of spyware on the iOS side & on the OSX side I was able to pinpoint things months sooner that on the Windows side despite the fact that both were compromised by persistent ACPI exploits(Loki on the Mac side, on the Windows side I can't confirm if they overwrote any EFI stuff but they definitely did some power management hacks which caused my Surface Pro to wig out if I managed to ACTUALLY disable the correct EFI options & attempt a force reboot...  Under the right config it would tweak out by rapidly going in & out of sleep to avoid ever flushing memory.  Normally it would fake it by pretending to shut off).\n\n\nThis gang stalking shit eventually led to in person harassment & death threats.  Initially I supported Bernie here in the Bay Area before supporting Trump so I'm pretty sure that this all started as part of a DNC effort to squash Bernie support since the earliest evidence I found was exactly as year before the election.  Seemed like all the harassment from the right was focused on forcing me to enlist in the military while a lot of the spook shit came from people who happened to be pro-Hillary like union members.  2 hands of the same beast....

'The only way Google is going to stop this is if they are hammered in a class action lawsuit by the conservative news sites they are misrepresenting. There is no reason that a good law firm couldn\'t hammer Google with a class action lawsuit for libel. These "fact checks" are so clearly defamatory and false. Google\'s intent to drive people away is made clear when almost every conservative news website is subjected to this while only one or two leftist outlet are given the same treatment.\n\nCalifornia Civil Code ¬ß 45:\n>**Libel is a false and unprivileged publication by writing**, printing, picture, effigy, or other fixed representation to the eye, **which exposes any person** to hatred, contempt, ridicule, or obloquy, or which causes him **to be shunned or avoided, or which has a tendency to injure him in his occupation.**\n\nHere, the Daily Caller already has several examples of blatantly false "fact checks", which purport to be factual analysis of these news articles. These articles are all published, which makes them libel as oppose to slander. These "fact checks" expose the Daily Caller and other conservative news outlets to be shunned or avoided because of their purported nonfactual nature. This scheme of Google\'s causes economic and reputational harm to the writers and the news organizations themselves by bringing them into disrepute and costing them ad revenue.\n\nIt\'s high time conservatives start fighting for their values‚Äîleftists have been trying to tear them down for too long and the problem has been largely ignored. Google particularly is a heinous perpetrator of this toxic culture and they need to be brought in line. Just like James Damore\'s lawsuit, every little violation of civil liberties, every instance of defamation needs to be called out and brought before a judge where appropriate. Otherwise, unchecked leftism will spread over this country like a cancer.'

'I never understood women (especially european women) that want to give up a reliable way to stop a threat, like a rapist. With knives, you have to still over power the rapist or get up close and personal. With pepper spray, it can get in your eyes if wind blows differently. With pepperspray or knives, you risk angering your rapist more if it doesnt stop him. \n\nWith a gun, you have the opportunity to put some distance between you and the rapist. You have higher chance of stopping the perp or even kill (so you wont worry about seeing the perp in future). A woman can take down a man that wouldve overpowered her just because males are generally stronger.'

He then finishes him off by putting one between his eyes. \n\nAfter this, he watches his life spins out of control. His professional and personal life are ruined. He is vilified by his town while his killer is mourned. Then has to defend himself in court.\n\nHe would then proceed to completely break down in court. He is completely alone. \n\nHe then gets sentenced to life in prison for defending himself.\n\n\nEven when we do nothing wrong we still suffer.\n\nI have some good ideas for speeches when he is defending himself and before he is sentenced already sort of written out and I have a good idea of what the entire opening would look like. \n\nThe now lifeless body of the attacker just collapses onto of the guy and we stay there in one extremely long shot. We are forced to watch this guy come to grips with what has just happened, what he has done and how he will deal with it. Just as he can't escape from the events that just transpired, neither can we, because we can't escape from life.\n\nUgh, it looks so good in my head."

Reasonable suspicion that they were here illegally is probable cause.\n\n> Bolton said that Arpaio and others in his department continued to round up people and try to turn them over to federal officials. \n\nIsn't that what he's supposed to do?? I'm really confused now. /r/all made it seem like the guy was rounding up every Hispanic that crossed his path and illegally detained them without respect to whether they were here legally or not. But if they were here illegally, shouldn't he turn them over to ICE? This isn't like SF where you have to follow what the mayor says or you're fired. Dude was elected to his position.\n\n> the sheriff lacked the authority to try to pursue immigration violations\n\nWhat? How? It's a crime. How is... how? whga??\n\n> and that Arpaio and his deputies would be violating the constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures if they held people who were not suspected of committing state crimes.\n\nNope, I'm done.

They relented a few days after that, but they only charged the hate crime because he coincidentally had a mental issue, no hate crime for anti-white attack.\n\nI can understand opposition to charging any more 'hate' crimes/speech/etc, but the left will NOT give this tactic up until it is used fairly for both sides (i.e. against them as well).  They will perpetuate until it is proven to them that there is no benefit for them to maintain this divisive tactic of judicial/police activism.\n"
'White supremacists also can\'t latch onto any of Trumps rhetoric (We all bleed the blood of Patriots). While the guy who tried to murder Scalise was high on the "Republicans committed 911" rhetoric of Bernie.'
'Oddly enough Trump has semi-supported (tweeted encouragement after he announced his run) Luther Strange, but that guy is neck-deep in shit right now in Alabama; he became the Acting Senator for Alabama after Sessions left as a result of the Governor naming him. That Governor was in the midst of a corruption investigation at the time, *with Strange as the prosecutor*. Yes, a defendant named his prosecution Senator using his powers as Governor. Truly insane.\n\nWhile I am not a huge fan of Roy Moore on account of him being really pushy with his Christian beliefs; he\'s the sort that believes Christianity should be law above conventional law. I understand that this is a fundamental belief for many, and I don\'t dispute Christianity\'s status as the traditional religion of America, but America right from the get-go was founded as a nation for everyone, **with church and state clearly separated.** This is not ambiguous or subject to interpretation, America was never intended to be a "Christian Nation" in the sense that the church exercises power over law.\n\nThat being said, while I disagree with him ideologically, he is also indisputably not a member of the establishment as evidenced by none of said establishment intervening to stop his fall in the media, he was thrown to the dogs. I also like the idea of more Republicans with iron-clad principles as opposed to the spineless "we can negotiate that" amoral types.\n\nSo interestingly I find myself as an agnostic supporting a rabid Christian, because yet again, the only alternative is a man mired in corruption (where have we seen that before?).'

'At this point there are only 3 ways you can reconcile the cognitive dissonance of siding with these known frauds without blatantly lying(which they are obviously not above,) which are "When the media lies it\'s okay because the ends justify the means/the enemy of my enemy is my friend/MSM is the lesser of two evils." Beliefs which ...basically define people as the useful idiots that we\'ve been saying they were for over a year ( and which explains why feminists defend muslims btw.) It\'s actually something I see on the right too. Leftists siding with CNN on an issue is like one of us siding with John McCain or the alt-right. It\'s easy to fall into a trap of voting against democrats on every issue because they\'re terrible but sometimes republicans are also terrible. Swamp creatures. also, the alt-right are racial identitarian collectivists. They\'re just as retarded as the radical leftists, but we just don\'t happen to find them to be a serious threat at the moment so we usually don\'t bother challenging them on their stupidity. We must stick to our principles, not our political party and not our skin color. '
'The fire and fury is upon CNN.'
'The most BUSTED fraud in news!'
"CNN is fake news, here is real news.\n\nIslam is the greatest killer of all time, worse than Christianity, fascism or communism. Islamic jihad destroyed a Christian Middle East and a Christian North Africa. Soon it was the fate of the Persian Zoroastrian and the Hindu to be the victims of jihad. The history of political Islam is the destruction of Christianity in the Middle East, Egypt, Turkey and North Africa. Half of Christianity was lost. Before Islam, North Africa was the southern part of Europe (part of the Roman Empire). Around 60 million Christians were slaughtered during the jihadic conquest. Half of the glorious Hindu civilization was annihilated and 80 million Hindus killed. The first Western Buddhists were the Greeks descended from Alexander the Great's army in what is now Afghanistan. Jihad destroyed all of Buddhism along the silk route. About 10 million Buddhists died. The conquest of Buddhism is the practical result of pacifism. Zoroastrianism was eliminated from Persia. The Jews became permanent dhimmis throughout Islam. In Africa over 120 million Christians and animists have died over the last 1400 years of jihad. Approximately 270 million nonbelievers died over the last 1400 years for the glory of political Islam. These are the Tears of Jihad which are not taught in any school.\n\n\nThese figures are a rough estimate of the death of non-Muslims by the political act of jihad.\n\n\nAfrica\n\n\nThomas Sowell [Thomas Sowell, Race and Culture, BasicBooks, 1994, p. 188] estimates that 11 million slaves were shipped across the Atlantic and 14 million were sent to the Islamic nations of North Africa and the Middle East. For every slave captured many others died. Estimates of this collateral damage vary. The renowned missionary David Livingstone estimated that for every slave who reached a plantation, five others were killed in the initial raid or died of illness and privation on the forced march.[Woman‚Äôs Presbyterian Board of Missions, David Livingstone, p. 62, 1888] Those who were left behind were the very young, the weak, the sick and the old. These soon died since the main providers had been killed or enslaved. So, for 25 million slaves delivered to the market, we have an estimated death of about 120 million people. Islam ran the wholesale slave trade in Africa.\n\n\n120 million Africans\n\n\nChristians\n\n\nThe number of Christians martyred by Islam is 9 million [David B. Barrett, Todd M. Johnson, World Christian Trends AD 30-AD 2200, William Carey Library, 2001, p. 230, table 4-10] . A rough estimate by Raphael Moore in History of Asia Minor is that another 50 million died in wars by jihad. So counting the million African Christians killed in the 20th century we have:\n\n\n60 million Christians\n\n\nHindus\n\n\nKoenard Elst in Negationism in India gives an estimate of 80 million Hindus killed in the total jihad against India. [Koenard Elst, Negationism in India, Voice of India, New Delhi, 2002, pg. 34.] The country of India today is only half the size of ancient India, due to jihad. The mountains near India are called the Hindu Kush, meaning the ‚Äúfuneral pyre of the Hindus.‚Äù\n\n\n80 million Hindus\n\n\nBuddhists\n\n\nBuddhists do not keep up with the history of war. Keep in mind that in jihad only Christians and Jews were allowed to survive as dhimmis (servants to Islam) everyone else had to convert or die. Jihad killed the Buddhists in Turkey, Afghanistan, along the Silk Route, and in India. The total is roughly 10 million. [David B. Barrett, Todd M. Johnson, World Christian Trends AD 30-AD 2200, William Carey Library, 2001, p. 230, table 4-1.]\n\n\n10 million Buddhists\n\n\nJews\n\n\nOddly enough there were not enough Jews killed in jihad to significantly affect the totals of the Great Annihilation. The jihad in Arabia was 100 percent effective, but the numbers were in the thousands, not millions. After that, the Jews submitted and became the dhimmis (servants and second class citizens) of Islam and did not have geographic political power.\n\n\nThis gives a rough estimate of 270 million killed by jihad.

'#COMPLETELY OFFTOPIC\n\nToday, as some of you may know, spez did an AMA thread on announcements. As often happens in threads like this, someone asked him why T_D has not been banned. This person listed no less than 45 links to T_D comments/threads that he believed violated reddit rules. Homie did his homework, and probably has no life. Here\'s what spez had to say in response:\n\n"Many of these links are probably in violation of our policy, but most are unreported, which is what alerts the mods and our team, especially when there are few votes. We\'ll consider them reported now.\nGenerally the mods of the_donald have been cooperative when we approach them with systematic abuses. Typically we ban entire communities only when the mods are uncooperative or the entire premise of the community is in violation of our policies. In the past we have removed mods of the_donald that refuse to work with us.\nFinally, the_donald is a small part of a large problem we face in this country‚Äîthat a large part of the population feels unheard, and the last thing we\'re going to do is take their voice away."\n\nI felt this was a fair and measured response. Of course, he got crushed for saying this, with other users saying things about T_D that almost certainly violate reddit rules, but that\'s neither here nor there. \n\nI thought it was kinda nice, to see so many people tell spez, "BAN T_D NAO" and his response was "LOL NO FUCK OFF".

'Source - http://archive.is/rI8zV\n\nFull article -\nThe blast was so powerful that it shook windows a mile away. Ahmad‚Äôs first thought was that someone had thrown yet another bomb at the police. He was right. On Wednesday night an explosive device was hurled at the police station in Rosengard, a troubled area of Malmo, Sweden‚Äôs third largest city. Attacks on the police are increasingly frequent. Rosengard‚Äôs force works from a black fortress of reinforced concrete with narrow windows and a 10ft-high electric fence. ‚ÄúI knew it was a bomb again,‚Äù said Ahmad, 53, who lives in the area with his wife and their four teenage children.\n\nSweden is among the world‚Äôs safest, richest and best-run countries enjoying steady growth and rising employment. But it has been experiencing an unprecedented surge of gang shootings, bombings and sexual assaults. In a country of 10m people, more than 320 shootings and dozens of bombings were reported in 2017, along with more than 110 murders and 7,226 rapes ‚Äî a 10% increase on 2016. More than 36% of young Swedish women say they feel unsafe at night. The authorities have admitted they are unable to investigate rape cases immediately because the resources are focused on gang crime. ‚ÄúWe are forced to choose between two evils,‚Äù the police said.\n\nThe crime surge is mainly confined to so-called ‚Äúareas of social exclusion‚Äù, a code for neighbourhoods such as Rosengard that are predominantly populated by immigrants. They are not classic ghettos ‚Äî the infrastructure and services are better than in areas of central London ‚Äî but these communities are plagued by high crime rates and unemployment. In Malmo, where a fifth of the 340,000 inhabitants are under 18, children as young as 14 roam the streets with Kalashnikov assault rifles and bulletproof vests. The average age of gang members is 22, the vast majority of them hailing from migrant families......\n\nFor a long time the Swedish establishment played down the decay of immigrant-dominated suburbs, but it can no longer ignore the explosion of violence. Stefan Lofven, the Social Democrat prime minister, said last week that he was ready to deploy the military to ‚Äústamp out‚Äù organised crime. The next day another bomb went off in Malmo, this time in front of a private property.\n\n‚ÄúWe have really reached the bottom: people use machineguns and hand grenades ‚Äî they want to kill,‚Äù said Zoran Markovic, the former chief of community policing in Rosengard. Markovic, a decorated officer, is the Swedish-born son of immigrants from Serbia. Rosengard‚Äôs new fortified police station was built after his locker room in the old building was peppered with bullets in a drive-by shooting. The situation has drastically worsened in the past two years. Markovic said the police are overstretched. Rosengard‚Äôs main school, which had pupils from nearly 200 different ethnic backgrounds, was closed because of social tension......\n\nTed Eriksson, 34, was inspired to become a police officer after a stint as an assistant to Kenneth Branagh, the British actor, during the filming of the Wallander crime series. Last August Eriksson was on duty at a pro-refugee rally in Stockholm when he was stabbed by an Afghan asylum seeker. He survived with minor injuries. The assailant claimed to be 17 but was suspected of being in his late twenties. He said he wanted to kill a policeman.\n\nRinkeby, a 20-minute metro ride from Stockholm‚Äôs old centre, is one of Sweden‚Äôs most crime-ridden areas. Paramedics and firefighters demand a police escort to go there. After nightfall, gangs of young men dominate the streets, offering drugs at the entrance to the station. A 25-year-old man was shot dead in a pizzeria this month. When I visited Rinkeby last week a group of youths in shell suits aggressively asked why I was in their neighbourhood. Their tone turned more respectful when they found out that I am from the Balkans ‚Äî the homeland of many local criminal kingpins. Born and raised in Rinkeby, they declared themselves not Swedish but Somali, Afghan or Lebanese.\n\nHanif Azizi, who came to Sweden from Iran as an unaccompanied refugee at the age of nine nearly 30 years ago, is a senior policeman in Rinkeby. ‚ÄúHating police is part of some of these kids‚Äô cultures. If as a society we have decided to take in refugees, we must set high standards: not ask what our society can do for them, but what they can do for our society,‚Äù he said......\n\nPaulina Neuding, an internationally acclaimed writer, was accused of xenophobia for linking the rise of anti-semitic and sexual crime to mass migration. Neuding, 36, born to a Jewish family who migrated from Poland, said Sweden is experiencing a ‚Äúsexual assault crisis‚Äù.\n\nStatistics published last week revealed the percentage of women who reported being victims of sex crimes rose from 1.4% in 2012 to 4.1% in 2016. In 2014 a study on the geography of outdoor rape in Stockholm found two-thirds of the suspects were non-Swedish citizens. ‚ÄúOur government declared itself the world‚Äôs first feminist government, yet they have quietly abandoned women,‚Äù Neuding said. ‚ÄúThere is mounting evidence that large-scale migration of men from extremely patriarchal cultures is limiting women‚Äôs freedom.‚Äù\n'

"The next phase to is reduce funding for the police force, and to make life very dangerous for the police force, so that many good police offices will feel demoralize, frustrated, hopeless, and will choose to retire, at which point, the globalist-in-charge will hire new 'diverse' police officers to replace them.\n\nAt a certain point, the people will realize the police is no longer on their side, and they will wonder how that came to be.

Stoltenberg's bio:\n\n> **Early political activity**\n\n> Stoltenberg's first steps into politics came in his early teens, when he was influenced by his sister Camilla, who at the time was a member of the then Marxist‚ÄìLeninist group Red Youth. Opposition to the Vietnam War was his triggering motivation. Following heavy bombing raids against the North Vietnamese port city of Hai Phong at the end of the Vietnam War, he participated in protest rallies targeting the United States Embassy in Oslo. On at least one occasion embassy windows were broken by stone-throwing protesters. Several of Stoltenberg's friends were arrested by the police after these events.\n\nKnowing that the head of NATO is sympathetic to communism and an anti-US protestor makes this all the better!"

'\n>Once upon a time there lived a farmer. He had amassed wealth by selling the produces that he got from his farms. He distributed that wealth to all the needy people. So, the whole village revered him for his magnanimity. But he had a persistent problem in his farms. Whenever he sowed seeds in his farm, the crows would come and eat them up. He was worried about this trouble and his profit from the farms went reduced. The contemplated the problem and came to a conclusion.\xa0\n\n>‚ÄúI must do something about these crows. I will be ruined if I do not stop this dangerous and destroying tendency of these crows," he thought. He consulted this problem with his friends. They gave an idea to get rid of this nagging problem.\xa0\n\n>The next day, as suggested by his friends, the farmer bought a scarecrow and placed it on the farm. The he sowed his seeds. ‚ÄúThis season, I hope, I will get a good harvest," he said to himself softly.\xa0\n\n>When the farmer came to his farm a few days later, he saw that crows had pushed the scarecrow on to the ground. And the grains were all eaten. The farmer cried out, ‚ÄúI am ruined." He again took this matter to his well-wishers. They decided to adopt another idea to bring this matter to an end.\xa0\n\n>The farmer sat the whole night thinking of a plan to get rid of the crows. Finally, just before dawn he had an idea, ‚ÄúI must go to the town and buy a large net. I will trap the crows in the net," he decided. Then he went to sleep.\xa0\n\n>The farmer then bought a net and some grain. He laid the net on the farm and spread the grain over it. Then he went and hid himself.\xa0\n\n>Soon the crows came to the fields to pick the grains. They were there. ‚ÄúMore grains! That farmer is indeed a foolish, he does not seem to learn," said the crows to each other. And they laughed among themselves. But suddenly they realized that they were trapped. They realized their foolish approach and greedy nature.\xa0\n\n>Before long, the farmer was standing over the crows. ‚ÄúAha! Finally, I have got you all. For the destruction you have caused me, I will put you all to death."\xa0\n\n>Suddenly the farmer heard a feeble voice among the noises of the crows. There was a pigeon among the crows. Both the pigeon and the bad crows were in the net. Both the pigeon and the bad crows were sad. The pigeon said, ‚ÄúMr. Farmer, please let me go. You are angry with the crows, not with me."\xa0\n\n>The farmer said, ‚ÄúBut you too have been caught stealing from my farm. I will not spare you," said the farmer. The pigeon had to pay a heavy price for having been in bad company. The farmer did not spare the pigeon either and he killed all the birds caught in his net. After that day, he was happy with his farm and he earned as usual heavy profit from his harvest'

He said Trump Tower.

Because feelings are subjective some times.\n\nAll these modern protests are people still stuck thinking a government based on hardwork is bad and are thinking they are in the right here. Add to that they are lazy and dont want to work on their skills in life. We have this salty shitshow we have today in america. It also started happening in my country when people march for unnecessary reasons when they could just work hard at it. \n\nAlso this generation as a whole is becoming lazy and it's getting difficult to get quality content wading through a lot of useless content.

Why do you think Fatty Kim changed his tune after meeting with Pres Xi? China is trying to fuck us over again. This move now drives a wedge between NK and China. NK can now pinpoint the blame for the cancelled summit on China, because they helped create this hostility. Yes the comments about VP Pence are bad, but imho, that isn't on the scale of them threatening the US. \n\nWhatever the outcome, NK loses and has to make concessions - they just need to determine which path they want to take."

"The CIA lied about WMDs in Iraq, leading to US intervention which killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and set the stage for the destabilization of the Middle East and the rise of ISIS.

They toppled democratic governments and replaced them with dictatorships. And they're the left's champions who can do no wrong."

They blacklisted him. He would get like 2nd or 3rd place in those town hall Caucasus or whatever and they would only mention who got 1st and 4th and just skip him. \n\nI was in Florida at the time and remember driving to Miami for work. I saw Ron Paul banners and signs ALL the way down I-95. \n\nI am almost convinced it was the audit the fed stuff that did this too him. JFK wanted to take away power from the Fed Reserve by using those silver notes and then was killed. \n\nThe first thing LBJ did when he came in was reverse that. Could be a conspiracy but seems interesting to me. \n\nRegardless, Ron Paul was deemed a threat to somebody and they blacklisted the crap out of him. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/tjuUWr9vaXo\n\nGo RAND 2024!\n\n\n'

'Even Putin knows Trump isn\'t like the rest and isn\'t like the typical trashbags that are in office. He\'s somebody much different. I believe the world also sees this and why you don\'t see as much carnage, chaos and shit going on.  It seems to be slowly taking a turn for the better, at least from what I\'m seeing. The neocons want Trump to start a war...ANYWHERE sooo bad, SO bad.  you can just see and feel it.  They are upset that he didn\'t invade Syria when he did his precision strikes.  I told everybody those strikes were meant to send a clear message.  "this is my line and don\'t you fucking DARE cross it. PEROD or I will strike harder with even MORE precision every time you go this far!"  It was to send a clear message to those other mother fuckers that want to be evil to people or that want to threaten the us or allied countries.  They will think to themselves "my god..he actually did it o.o umm...guys? you wanna rethink our strategy about threatening the united states now that he\'s in there? :O " \n\nTrump did what he needed to do in Syria. Mostly that was to send a clear message "don\'t fuck with me or push me too far", as well as beating the shit out of ISIS, which is pretty much dismantled now.  why? because their funds are totally stripped and cut off. The CIA has been figured out and they can\'t get away with it anymore.  Trump did NOT take the bait at all about "invading" a country to start a war.  will skirmishes and shit that needs to get handled happen? sure, of course they will! But he will never get us into a full blown war.  That is why our country continues to do so well.  He is focusing mostly all of his efforts on the united states. As it should be.'
"The politics and world news subreddits are going crazy right now. Literally everything they've posted in the last 2 years is about Trump and how bad he is. \n\nThey're almost short circuiting at this point. "
"THIS IS WHY TRUMP WON...THE PEOPLE DON'T CARE ABOUT RUSSIA BUT THEY DO CARE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON AT HOME."
'I think its a rather fruitless meeting. For Putin, Hillary\'s Emails aren\'t worth the harddrive they are on, he also just lost 200 troops to the US in Syria, Trump is suppressing oil price and calling out Germany for buying Russian energy, plus all the sanctions, Putin has 1001 complains but nothing to offer other than NK and limited anti-terro coordination in the middleeast. Dems talk war but what they are mad about is that Trump is making actual demand of mother Russia, no more "flexibility after election" and another free Crimea.  '
'The reason they aren\'t happy is because the Afghanistan and Iraq goldmine is going bye bye, and they need to gin up a new cold war to make themselves trillions in defense contracts. Mark my words Trump will be killed by a "Scalia Special" heart attack at some point.'
'Damn if only the media didn‚Äôt lie about him being an old crazy cook.... the man silenced everyone in a room during debates. Made both dems and reps look stupid. '
"It's kind of that simple for me...people I don't like on both sides are ripping Trump which means Trump did a good job.\n\nThe GOP establishment like Paul Ryan and the deranged left and warmongers like Clinton don't like it..\n\nPeople who want the US military to go on bombing runs everyday."
'Neocons are only happy when they are waging war and causing destruction. I used to wonder if these wars were really about oil and money, and I think I have the answer. These wars are the wish-dreams of psychopathic whack jobs. The oil and the money are just a bonus to them; their real motivations are much darker, satanic, even. \n\nWar is about power, and power is what neocons desire, above all else. The leader of Goatfuckistan is basically irrelevant to them, good bad or indifferent. \n'
"I'm starting to fear that the left might be victims of some new MKUltra program."
'What a horrible time that was, I couldn\'t stand it, I called Nancy Pelosi, I begged and screamed for her to do something - but no.   As far as I am concerned anyone who had even a glimmer of power back then has real blood on their hands.   Not only were hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed their homes, schools, hospitals, doctor\'s offices, libraries, museums, universities, the whole culture.    The neo-cons gleefully wiped out the future for every Iraq child who managed to live though their mindless carnage.  The people of Iraq spent generations holding back Iran and defending their culture and Independence future and we (no matter how much I screamed and hated it, I still have to write "we") woke up one morning and decided to smash it to smithereens.\n\nThat is way they have a deep state, to hide their ugly, ugly actions.   If we don\'t know about them, we can\'t stop them, **and the reality THEY HATE THE MOST IS - if we find out about them we can stop them, we can do that, we morons in fly-over country can take their little spy glasses away from them and sit them in the corner.**   And then who/what are they but powerless TRAITORS.\n\nI think one of the reasons they are so mad is because President Trump stiff-armed them out of his meeting.   They want to know everything that is going on so that they can hatch their plans and set their booby traps.\n\nWhen I think of neocons I can\'t help but fondly review this early internet memory:  A long time ago when the internet was still young, the smug, entitled neocon, Bill Kristol, who held a way too high opinion of himself bethought himself to be a blogger.   It was one of those precious internet moments we see illustrated here now and again - "this is how he sees himself; this is how he really is".  The abecedarian, Kristol thought to be hailed as the grue of the internet, a pedagogue, a preceptor, but our wondrous progenitors on the internet burst out laughing. (I used [Dictionary.com](https://Dictionary.com) for synonyms).\n\nAnyway, I don\'t know how long he spent under his bed but when he crawled out he condemned the whole internet as a "Seething swamp" and vowed he would never risk reality hitting him in the face ever again.'

'AMEN. As soon as the reason for our invasion went from ‚ÄúWeapons of mass destruction‚Äù to ‚ÄúMaking Iraq Free for Democracy‚Äù I knew that we had been duped and we were screwed! The Bushes and war mongers on both sides HATE Trump for pointing this out. He‚Äôs screwing with their ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù. '
'The irony is it used to be the left that hated the CIA'
"Well don't forget for a while even mainstream Republican voters defended the Iraq War to no end, not simply because of support for our boys out there (everyone should), but because they believed the Iraqi people really deserved democracy. \n\nIt was a massive mistake, regardless of how wonderful it is for the Iraqi people to vote freely. It entirely fucked and destabilized an already bloody region into total chaos. "
'I remember when GOP candidate Dr. Ron Paul was saying this at the debates (and discussing blowback) and how every other candidate (including Mr. Bomb-Bomb-Iran) attacked him for it. In case anyone missed the memo, THAT is what the rest of the GOP elites/establishment still represents. '

'You ever notice how these people never talk about BEING someone like a ditch digger or factory worker, only about "fighting for them"? They all think they\'ll get some cushy, low-responsibility office job and get to go to the Communist Store and pick out new Ipads and clothes whenever they want.  Stop at Red StarBucks and get some free latte. \n\nThey think everyone else will be the ones forced to work in the boot factory. They think they won\'t be murdered when they can\'t do the manual labor because of their "disabilities". Oh, you have social anxiety and can\'t work? Go round back of the chemical shed, and let\'s talk. \n\nAnd what communist regime has EVER protected or done anything for a minority or marginalized group? \n\nSo, in short, most leftists tend to be kids who were handed everything, or people who think a marketable skill is just their skin color.

'And this is why it\'s not exactly communism they are spreading; in fact, it\'s fascism.  These "socialists" are no different than the "socialists" of Nazi Germany.\n\nThese people are so beyond bat-shit crazy they don\'t even know what ideology they\'re actually spreading.  This isn\'t a rise of socialism, it\'s a rise of fascism.  It\'s not a rich against poor, as these people are apart of the upper class.  They hate based on ideology, and race, and attempting to make social wars against particular groups mostly based on their ideology "purity".  It\'s no different than the Nazi Party blaming the Jews; in this case, it\'s the Democrats blaming the Whites, or more specifically, what they believe are the ideologically impure whites.  In their minds, they aren\'t as successful because of group A, and group A are men, white, and or old, individually success people.\n\nAt the end of the day, what is occurring is an attempt to ideologically purify to maintain totalitarian control.  It\'s not about wealth, outside of the rich getting richer.  It\'s the reality of what these people are doing, and it\'s absolutely beyond scary that the West is close to being one election off from a repeat of the 19th century.'
'You already are starting to see this attitude shift with ghetto types expressing contempt for "woke" "white folk".   It\'s not enough that they are "woke" spouting their propaganda.  They want even more - for there to be no more "white" folk.  It was never about being "woke" to so-called "racism" and "oppression" - it was always about contempt for the colour of "white" peoples skin.'
"It is also very possible that the intention of Marxism/Communism itself is the destruction it causes because when you take human nature into account the concept of a communist utopia is 100% impossible. \n\nFor example, think of a communal task in your own household, that no one likes to do, like doing dishes. How many times have those dishes stacked up because everyone decides it's someone else's job? For most homes that happens literally every week. Now multiply that exponentially where your life depends on the generosity of complete strangers. If your own family is willing to let the house go to shit what the fuck do you think a complete stranger is going to do?"
'1000% on point. \n\nPost-revolution Russia went from a somewhat troubled, but still prosperous country whose biggest problems were an incompetent king and an unpopular war, to a starving, nearly post-apocalyptic land rife with anarchy where the intelligentsia were joyfully trampled by the newly empowered underclassmen. Said underclassmen formed what was essentially large-scale militarized bands and proceeded to fight over whatever scraps were left. The bolsheviks were the biggest band (and they grabbed the most during the revolution), but they had enough competition to keep the mutual slaughter going.\n\nFuck only knows what would have happened if not for NEP (New Economic Policy) that somewhat restored the commerce and private property rights. Much to the disappointment of the commies, BTW. That only staved off the spectre of oblivion; then along came Stalin and basically terrorized the country into getting its shit together. The results were quite impressive, and what\'s a few million dead people between friends.\n\nAmerican "communists" are idiots. The pink-haired genderfluid soyboys will be the first ones swinging from the lamp posts when shit hits the fan. That is if they are lucky to just be quickly and easily killed by the aforementioned commissars Jamal and Cletus. Those that won\'t be, will slowly starve and/or freeze to death.'
"Wait wait, there is one little piece of bullshit here I have to point out. We totally could feed ourselves as a nation, easy.

I thought "litigate" meant a case has been brought and argued before the court.  So how would this be "relitigating" the past?

You cant pull up people. Sure you can redistribute  (feed a man a fish). But for their equality to work you have to set a really low bar and tear people down to this common denominator and force equity through affirmative action, admission quotas, etc.   \n\nChurchill said it best:\n\n "Socialism is a philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of envy. Its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery."\n\n\nThe irony is that socialism, by default, is the absolute enemy of progress.   \n\n"Can a man tax themselves into prosperity?

Trump is the first to do this, and look at what we may have here: The end of a 50 year war. \n\nThis was previously unthinkable. There were literally people pitching ideas of buying out the Un regime for billions of dollars, *that* is how desperate people were. \n\n***\n\nEDIT:\n\nYep, see here. On **5/16/2017, [Philip Gordon wrote](http://archive.is/RMB8T):**\n\n> Trump seems to believe that blustery threats, backed by a military buildup and talk of an "armada" heading toward the Sea of Japan will somehow **induce adversaries in Pyongyang or Beijing to abandon longstanding and deeply held positions.** But he seems to have no plan in place if and when those adversaries call his bluff.\n\nStill looking for the buy out piece. If anyone has it, feel free to PM me the link and I\'ll include it in this comment.\n\n***\n\nEDIT II:\n\nPretty [sure I\'ve found it](https://www.inquisitr.com/4212098/kim-jong-un-removal-will-cost-175-billion-claims-a-new-theory/). A professor of Inha University in South Korea, Shepherd Iverson, pitched the idea of paying **$175 billion** to \'buy out\' the Un regime. It includes nifty payments which ranged from  $100K to $30mil for elites and immunity for Un.\n\n> Apart from $30 million, up to $23.3 billion would be paid in total to the families of those elite officials who wield power in Pyongyang. Shepherd notes that the top ten families would receive $30 million each, and the top thousand families would get $5 million.\n\n> In the hermit state, there are more than 11,000 elite officials, including army generals and chief officers. A sum of at least $1 million will be given to these officials while the next tier of 50,000 elites would be paid between $100,000 and $500,000.'

"Drumpf is going to get us into a nuclear war! He can't be trusted with the nuclear codes!  Somehow I think that CNN will still be talking about Pornstars.  I'm my lifetime I've seen legitimate news become tabloids and tabloids become legitimate news.  Strange timeline. "
"I read a comment on reeeeeedacted that this is largely ceremonial. I worked the Korean theater as a linguist/analyst for 10 years. I can tell you confidently,\n\n**NO IT IS FUCKING NOT CEREMONIAL**\n\nIn fact, what it is is the death knell of North Korea itself. The end of its regime. We always played out two scenarios to the eventual demise of North Korea: **Hard Landing** and **Soft Landing**. And both scenarios were disastrous.\n\nHard Landing was war. Seoul would have become a sea of fire within the first twenty minutes from all the artillery. Millions would have died. The entire NK air force would be smoldering wreckage within the first three days.The NK army would have pushed to the Pusan Perimeter before they ran out of gas, and every base and installation north of it would have been destroyed with all or most personnel killed. Then, counter-punch from us, and within three to six months it would be all over. North Korea would be gone. History. (Much more involved here, with China, etc, but for the sake of brevity)\n\nSoft Landing was better, but still pretty bad. A refugee crisis of epic proportions would have flooded the Chinese border, and people would have even braved the DMZ, getting blown up and machine-gunned by their own army. A limited military skirmish would be inevitable, but more than likely a general or two would start a coup in the face of the crisis and NK would dissolve into a factional civil war of some kind. The end result would be the same though: NK would be finished.\n\n**This development** however is something entirely different. It is something we never, ever, EVER imagined would happen: that North Korea would end the war and disarm. I mean, MY GOD we never imagined this would be possible. And its the end of North Korea, twenty, thirty years from now or even sooner, because the Hermit Kingdom can only exist in a state of total secrecy. Their population is so isolated, they literally live in 1950s conditions. And yet, bit by bit, a view of the real world is filtering in drop by drop. The damage is irreversable to the Kim regime. **THIS IS NOT AN 'END TO THE WAR.' THIS IS A SURRENDER.**\n\nNow, don't get me wrong. North Korea is still going to be around for a while. The PTB have to figure out what the next move is, and the next move is tranferring their ill-gotten-gains offshore and setting up a safe haven for their bug-out. They're probably pissing themselves though because they know that no matter where they go, they're dog meat. But to stay inside the gulag that they created, and having THEIR VICTIMS, THE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE have them would be infinitely worse. Think [Nicolae Ceausecu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDRXGiYRsw) and his bitch wife, times 100.\n\nThis is a slow-moving collapse in the making, as more and more South Korean (western) culture filters north. This is the best possible scenario that could have happened, imo, and without a shot fired.\n\nThis is not a ceremonial move. This is **TOTAL FUCKING VICTORY**."

Instead of going into them and then dispersing the illegal aliens that live there out into various parts of the country side we acknowledge these places as Sanctuary cities and then create pamphlets expressing that the only places these illegal aliens will find safety is in these cities.\n\nAt that point you begin to hit the areas that have expressed a desire to remove the illegal occupants that are living uninvited in the rest of this countries lands..  Instead of dispersing the illegal immigrants you herd them into the sanctuary cities to live among the people who claim to want to protect them.  When the moment comes that the people living in these sanctuary cities are tired of living in a lawless environment and want to return to a point in time when doors, fences, locks, and such mean something then the illegal immigrants will already be centralized and easy to return to their native countries they came from.\n\nI think instead of driving out the illegal immigrants from the sanctuary cities we should be driving illegal immigrants into them.  Give the people living in these cities what they want.  Give it to them till they choke on it. "

I still think people are overreacting to want a bunch of statues taken down.  At least they're recognizing Lenin as a horrible person and taking his butt down too. *Edit: Grammar, very tired*"

I can't stand the Dixie flag and think Andrew Jackson was a genocidal asshole... but history belongs visible in the books and the landscape so we're not doomed to repeat it... folks like me will be painted as threatening.  **They're hoping to get one-on-one violence going so they can play some national, psychological 'martial law' card... .**  not actual martial law but (at the very least) a nationwide feeling of desperation and fear that greases the way towards impeachment and derailment of the Executive Branch.  It's ALL smoke and mirrors, it's all politically motivated  But this is just public vandalism by a few actors, some paid.  **Like the toppling of the Saddam statue, remember?. That piece of shit PSYOP didn't fool a single arab.**  It was eye candy for the US audience and it SHOCKED and ASHAMED the Iraqis when they thought the plain clothes crowd was arab at first.  Nothing about this revisionism is real and reflects the will of the people.  Except in Baltimore.  That's a real lost city."
'# EDIT: Just a FYI- I think slavery is wrong, and i appreciate equality in all of is glory. I wrote this because I appreciate historic accuracy and truth. not this misguided narrative we have today. so please no "OMG UR SUCH A BIGOT" bullshit. thanks. \n\n-----------\n\ni wish more people would realize that the civil war was never fought  only because of slavery, Slavery yes, was a secondary point, but it wasnt why the war was fought. After decades of changing the narrative of history, very few people know that any more. \n\nit was never the narratives they teach in school these days\n\n--------------\n# Whats taught: \n\n----------\n\n**North:** "South, you cant have slaves anymore"  \n**South:** "Over our dead bodies"  \n**South:** "LETS GO TO WAR BITCHES"\n\nWe teach our kids, even today, that the entire war was fought purely over slavery. we teach them that the southerners were just a bunch of bigots and racists, determined to keep black people oppressed. Why do you think kids grow up with this notion that all southerners are KKK members and Hicks? \n\n---------------\n#What happened in actuality:\n\n----------\n\n> Abraham Lincoln: \n> Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that by the accession of a Republican Administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered. There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that "I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so."  \n\n> ‚Äî First inaugural address, 4 March 1861\n\nWhen Abraham Lincoln was elected president as the first ***REPUBLICAN*** president, he was openly opposed to the "radical republicans", a minority faction within the republican party,  who vehemently believed that the federal government had a duty to abolish slavery- however the majority congress at the time, was simply angling to trap the south in a cage, to effectively make them into a money farm for the federal government, in a system where they would have no power.  \n\nThe reason, the south left the union, was because of the Election results. the **DEMOCRATIC SOUTH** had a hissy fit, because their party had lost the election, but their hissyfit was Justified for two reasons.\n \nThe south had justifiable qualms with happened as a result of this election: \n\n1. after years of fending off massive tariff hikes from the Republican controlled congress in the years before, they had finally been kneecapped, and were going to be forced into absurdly high taxation and tarrifs by the north, with absolutely no ability for them to ever fight them off legally. The north had effectly locked them into a cage of starving rats that would effectively chew away at their power, wealth, and way of life. \n2. it became clear that the south would no longer have ANY lawmaking power in the country as a result of the Missouri compromise that effectively divided the north and south, preventing any new slave states from being created, but allowed for non-slave states to be created with relative ease, leaving a larger balance in the north, than in the south, and prevented the south from creating new states in the Louisiana purchase to offset the congressional imbalance of power.  After the Missouri compromise, there would NEVER be another democratically elected president from the southern states. \n\n# ***Even if Every single state that didn\'t vote for Lincoln, had voted for bell or Breckenridge exclusively- they would have still completely and totally lost the election without question. it had become impossible to elect any president other than the one the north chose - completely undermining the fair and equal democratic society we had created up until this point.***  \n\n**FURTHERMORE**: the war was not started by the south. The south left the union. the war began when lincoln decided to send wartime supplies to Fort Sumter, which for anyone unfamiliar, is in the heart of the south. the South said "no, were not having any of that shit. we let you keep the fort out of courtesy, but were not letting you build a goddamned fighting force right in the middle of our territory" and kicked them the hell out. \n\nthe start of the war was literally the equivalent of a bully backing a kid into a corner demanding his lunch money, and then throwing a punch at them and missing, and then being mad because the kid swung back. \n \n> Abraham Lincoln:  \n> My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union ...  I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.\n\nLincoln literally only issued the emancipation proclamation freeing the slaves, because he knew it would cripple and end the south, and ultimately win him the war, because they wouldn\'t be able to split their focus between waging war, and keeping their slaves in check back home. this was the turning point of the war that ensured the north\'s victory. \n\n------------\n\nThe war was never about slavery. It was never this fairy tail of Lincoln being this superhero that championed the rights of the slaves that was cooked up and handed to children as legitimate history. \n\n# The war was about money and power for the north period- slavery was an afterthought. \n\n----------\nJoke EDIT:\n\n# [Abe lincoln vampire hunter](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1611224/) was a more accurate portrayal of history than what kids are being taught today.

"They accuse everything they do, and they do everything they accuse.\n\nOne can only wonder how a party can run so many cities into the ground for so many decades, but then continue getting re-elected because it's all some other guy's fault someplace else. You look at the media spewing radioactive waste 24/7, and suddenly it almost starts to make sense."
"Shameless hijack reminder that the alleged 'reversal' of Democrats and Republicans was actually just the diehard confederate Democrats finally losing their lock on the south."
'This. 1000x this. Even in the south, the narrative is very quickly being changed to "it was slavery, white southerners are bad, feel guilty because it is entirely your fault, even if your family has only been in the US 4 generations at this point. You are bad by default" \n\nWhat is also entirely ignored are the numbers of black and \'mulatto (mixed)\' slave owners in the US during the antebellum era. It is either conveniently ignored, or downright lied about. And don\'t even get me started on the fact that slave status wasn\'t limited to only the black portion of the population. But talking about that makes you an immediate racist, even though people of Irish descent weren\'t considered \'white\' until the 1950s and 60s. (neither were eastern Europeans from anywhere east of Poland or so, or people from the countries bordering the Mediterranean, but my point still stands as is.)'
"Wait, people aren't taught it this way??? \n\nWe learned the simplistic way when we were kids but then in middle school and high school we were taught that it was more complicated than we were told before and were basically told the other way because we weren't ready for the nuance (which I agree is true for the most part). We learned all the reasons you stated.\n Hell, it was one of the things we went over most after the founding of the US. It was necessary to know this for the AP exam anyways. SMH this shit is important. "
'> The war was about money and power for the north period- slavery was an afterthought.\n\nThis so much. The war was started with economic motivations, followed by slavery being tagged in later on.'
"(I'm asking this because I genuinely don't know, not to argue or really debate at all)\n\nYou mentioned the Missouri compromise as one of the justified qualms regarding their outrage of the election. Wasn't the Missouri compromise specifically dealing with slave states and non-slave states? If another Southern state elected president would never be elected because it made it so hard *for new states* to be a slave state, how can you say that the war wasn't, at least in some part, about slavery? \n\nI'm not sure it would be fair to say it was just an afterthought. \n\n\n"

'Interesting article out yesterday from Buchanan on this subject:\n\n""They had found a leader, Robert E. Lee ‚Äî and what a leader! ... No military leader since Napoleon has aroused such enthusiastic devotion among troops as did Lee when he reviewed them on his horse Traveller."\n\nSo wrote Samuel Eliot Morison in his magisterial "The Oxford History of the American People" in 1965.\n\nFirst in his class at West Point, hero of the Mexican War, Lee was the man to whom President Lincoln turned to lead his army. But when Virginia seceded, Lee would not lift up his sword against his own people, and chose to defend his home state rather than wage war upon her.\n\nThis veneration of Lee, wrote Richard Weaver, "appears in the saying attributed to a Confederate soldier, \'The rest of us may have ... descended from monkeys, but it took a God to make Marse Robert.\'"\n\nGrowing up after World War II, this was accepted history.\n\nYet, on the militant left today, the name Lee evokes raw hatred and howls of "racist and traitor." A clamor has arisen to have all statues of him and all Confederate soldiers and statesmen pulled down from their pedestals and put in museums or tossed onto trash piles.\n\nWhat has changed since 1965?\n\nIt is not history. There have been no great new discoveries about Lee.\n\nWhat has changed is America herself. She is not the same country. We have passed through a great social, cultural and moral revolution that has left us irretrievably divided on separate shores.\n\nAnd the politicians are in panic.\n\nTwo years ago, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe called the giant statues of Lee and "Stonewall" Jackson on Richmond\'s Monument Avenue "parts of our heritage." After Charlottesville, New York-born-and-bred McAuliffe, entertaining higher ambitions, went full scalawag, demanding the statues be pulled down as "flashpoints for hatred, division, and violence."\n\nWho hates the statues, Terry? Who\'s going to cause the violence? Answer: The Democratic left whom Terry must now appease.\n\nMcAuliffe is echoed by Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, the Democratic candidate in November to succeed McAuliffe. GOP nominee Ed Gillespie wants Monument Avenue left alone.\n\nThe election is the place to decide this, but the left will not wait.\n\nIn Durham, North Carolina, our Taliban smashed the statue of a Confederate soldier. Near the entrance of Duke University Chapel, a statue of Lee has been defaced, the nose broken off.\n\nWednesday at dawn, Baltimore carried out a cultural cleansing by taking down statues of Lee and Maryland Chief Justice Roger Taney who wrote the Dred Scott decision and opposed Lincoln\'s suspension of the right of habeas corpus.\n\nLike ISIS, which smashed the storied ruins of Palmyra, and the al-Qaida rebels who ravaged the fabled Saharan city of Timbuktu, the new barbarism has come to America. This is going to become a blazing issue, not only between but within the parties.\n\nFor there are 10 Confederates in Statuary Hall in the Capitol, among them Lee, Georgia\'s Alexander Stephens, vice president to Jefferson Davis, and Davis himself. The Black Caucus wants them gone.\n\nMount Rushmore-sized carvings of Lee, Jackson and Davis are on Stone Mountain, Georgia. Are they to be blasted off?\n\nThere are countless universities, colleges and high schools like Washington & Lee named for Confederate statesmen and soldiers. Across the Potomac from D.C. are Jefferson Davis Highway and Leesburg Pike to Leesburg itself, 25 miles north. Are all highways, streets, towns and counties named for Confederates to be renamed? What about Fort Bragg?\n\nOn every Civil War battlefield, there are monuments to the Southern fallen. Gettysburg has hundreds of memorials, statues and markers. But if, as the left insists we accept, the Confederates were traitors trying to tear America apart to preserve an evil system, upon what ground do Democrats stand to resist the radical left\'s demands?\n\nWhat do we do with those battlefields where Confederates were victorious: Bull Run, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville?\n\n"Where does this all end?" President Trump asked.\n\nIt doesn\'t. Not until America\'s histories and biographies are burned and new texts written to Nazify Lee, Jackson, Davis and all the rest, will a newly indoctrinated generation of Americans accede to this demand to tear down and destroy what their fathers cherished.\n\nAnd once all the Confederates are gone, one must begin with the explorers, and then the slave owners like Presidents Washington, Jefferson and Madison, who seceded from slave-free Britain. White supremacists all.\n\nAndrew Jackson, Henry Clay of Kentucky and John Calhoun must swiftly follow.\n\nThen there are all those segregationists. From 1865 to 1965, virtually all of the great Southern senators were white supremacists.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Woodrow Wilson and FDR carried all 11 states of a rigidly segregationist South all six times they ran, and FDR rewarded Dixie by putting a Klansman on the Supreme Court.\n\nWhile easy for Republicans to wash their hands of such odious elements as Nazis in Charlottesville, will they take up the defense of the monuments and statues that have defined our history, or capitulate to the icon-smashers?\n\nIn this Second American Civil War, whose side are you on?"\n\nhttp://buchanan.org/blog/americas-second-civil-war-127520'

"There are SJWs filing change dot org petitions to have the statues removed in small Texas towns. These idiot people don't even live there. Example, Granbury, TX in Hood County. Some woman that doesn't live there has filed a petition on change dot org to remove the statue of General Hiram Granbury CSA. Gen. Granbury never lived in the town, but many of his troops did. There are hundreds of ex-CSA soldiers buried in the area and there are descendants of these people there still. It was discovered that Gen. Granbury's grave in Illinois was in disrepair, so the town managed to have him reinterred in his namesake town. A lovely statue and gazebo are on the courthouse square. There is a bean and chili cook-off on his birthday. Well, a firestorm has erupted on FB about this. Almost no one wants this to happen. To their credit, the younger people in town have stepped up in protest. One person suggested moving the statue to the cemetery, but that didn't go over well. Someone said that they read that Granbury was an attorney and not a slave owner. People are asking when this insanity will stop, and threatening armed conflict should anyone try to change the town. In addition, Hood County is named after General Hood who many local men also served under. The population of the county is only about 55,000. So, some bitch from somewhere has hurt a huge amount of people in this town and county. They were already worrying about this, hoping it wouldn't be an issue there, and now it is a threat. Thanks George Soros, CNN, and SPLC. You now have close to 55,000 new enemies. And that doesn't count all the other towns and counties in Texas."
'So what. The 1950s and 1960s were--you guessed it--part of American history.

Meanwhile, if Hillary had her 30,000 emails discovered and 29,999 of them contained image attachments of her snorting cocaine off a dead baby, handing title deeds to Uranium deposits in the Yellowstone state park to North Korea, and holding a smoking gun next to Seth Rich\'s lifeless body while holding that day\'s paper..... they would find some flaw to remain in denial. \n\nJust like the way they claim, without a shred of evidence let alone a shred of dignity, that Assange is a Russian agent.

The economy will fall apart and capital will flee or be handed over to the deep state. It's go time. This sub is about to either shut down or neutered. When that happens regroup elsewhere on line.

Then unmask every individual who supported sedition, treason. You will say thats alot of work, its not possible, i say its alot of enemies and must be done. Even if its just a large chunk off the top of these organisations. Remember they supported and called for genocide and oppression based on skin colour, others race traitors, they shot us, caused physical harm and caused many to spill blood, lit us on fire, attacked our children and tried to supress us.

Yea, they compare us to an evil group of SOCIALISTS(another funny coincidence) who mass murdered people for their religion and race because we don't support gays getting married, but they yell for equality for the Muslims who still do allot of similar things to the Nazis.

'This is why it drives me mad when people try to equate strict border policy with racism.\n\nIts a matter of infrastructure and being able to account for changes of population and being able to control the flow of immigration so that the proverbial ship doesn\'t get filled beyond capacity and sink.\n\nThis is a wildly simplified example, but the point still stands:  Imagine a farmer needing to farm food for 360 million people.  Turns out there are actually 400 million people, but because those 40 million people had come in undocumented (and thus unaccounted for in population records), there wasn\'t enough food made for everyone.\n\nYou also need to be able to slow the flow of immigration should conditions not be able to support more people at that moment.\n\nYet all the people crying over the "meanie booboo-head Drumpf" just want to live in this naive Kumbaya of "just let everyone in maaaaan come on what are you some kind of self-interested scumbag.... maaaan evil white people" (the people who try to make immigration all about race ironically project their fixation on race upon the "evil white supremacists"..........)\n\n**TLDR: The argument needs to be made more strongly that immigration and border control are matters of logistics and infrastructure.**'

Without the Russian pushback we'd be talking about the genocide of every slavic person as far as the Ural mountains. Jews were higher up on the Nazi's racial grouping than the slavs were. "

"5 years ago when you bought a game it was a complete product.\n\nNowadays some developers/publishers want you to pay $50 for the base game and then nickel-and-dime you for additional content, sometimes content that helps you win (pay to win).

"Do you know Candy Crush? Know how they write the game to start off where you're having a good time, and suddenly you hit levels that seem impossible, and they give you the option to pay for little boosts (Hey, $1.99 here, $.99 there, no big deal, right? Slowly milking your wallet)...\n\nWell, now imagine that with a $59.99 console game, not a free phone app, and the little boosts cost from $0.99 to $29.99 or more.\n\nIt's BAD BAD BAD."
"A whole FUCK LOAD of bullshit practices, all clearly just money-grabbing tactics. Star Wars games are some of my very favorite, and to see the last two games boil down to nothing more than a very obvious attempt to drain every last cent from you, it's just soul crushing. And the worst part is, nothing about that or EA is going to change. It's already planned in their marketing scheme. They could not give less of a shit about the customer, only the customer's wallet and how much they can milk from it."

CNN, ABC, BBC, MSNBC, NY Times etc. all their bullshit is spread around the world and as far as I'm concerned, all of them belong in jail not only for trying to destroy President Trump and defrauding the American people but for turning people in other countries against him and their supporters. I'm from Australia so believe me when I tell you their fake bullshit has spread over here and most people believe President Trump who's the victim and the good guy, is the evil bad guy. I am utterly furious at what's being going on and I want everyone involved (not just the fake news but Obama, Hillary, DNC, Hollywood etc. etc. to pay.

And than in the same breath she\'ll talk about how race and gender don\'t exist and bla bla bla... Fuck. Off. Seriously she told me to my face "all men are trash, and if you\'re offended by that then you are trash". Umm WTF? By that logic someone could say to her or any SJW "all women are objects, if that offends you are an object", oh but no! Saying that\'s is the fucking end of the world. \n\nI try to be understanding of all opinions but shit, if you\'re going to insult me with your shitty contradictory arguments while providing zero proof of anything you can fuck off, \n\nI could honestly go all day and night just venting but I\'m going to stop myself here.

I told him it was bc he was a "fucking white male". He said "Ya unfortunately I don\'t have any hint of American Indian in my DNA".

'You shouldn\'t be applauded if your reasoning was really just "this is liberal bullshit."\n\nYou need to actually be articulate.\n\nI was in a history of ancient civilization class during the summer.  The overwhelming theme during ever part of the class was on the patriarchy in each era and civilization.  The final paper was on the 5 pillars of Islam.  I knew it was all horse shit, and I wrote a thought out comment when I submitted my paper.  The professor was obviously pissed by it when they responded, but luckily they still gave me a good grade.\n\nMy professor for History of U.S. history was a white guy, king of the cucks.  Named both of his kids after black authors and told us that when he moved here he wanted to live in an "integrated" area.  (because zoning is segregation to him).  He told us right away that his focus of study was on civil rights and african american history.  So you can guess that the entire course was about civil rights, NOT U.S. history.  The whole thing was about race.  I suffered through it and sat there grinding my teeth every time someone started talking about politics or whatever.  \n\nThe point is, you\'re there to get a piece of paper so you can get the job you want one day.  I think for the most part you should just suffer through the shit and keep your mouth shut.  It\'s hard, but I have to do it a lot because for the most part you\'re going to be in classrooms of people where someone with your views is a minority.\n\nThinking you\'re badass because you "don\'t give a fuck" and calling it "liberal bullshit" isn\'t helping anything and it\'s not constructive.  If anything it could really hurt you.  You think the dean of students or whatever is going to see what you said and it\'s going to "red pill" him?  There are some battles that aren\'t worth fighting.  I wouldn\'t have withdrawn from the class, I would have met with the professor privately or emailed them with your opinions and asked to hear their reasoning for the content in the course. '

The problem is simple. If the public trusted the Media we would not have a President Trump.\n\n\nThe people will draw their own conclusions when they read it. The people know the media today is Pravda at its best.\n\n\nYou can really sense the sheer panic in the Democrats.\n\nExpect Trump to use his Twitter to trigger the Media in his own special way and in their anger publicize the Memo even more.

So I am laid back even on this memo issue.\n\nReleasing it is just the first step. Then comes proving it with underlying documents like fisa application, then investigations on named individuals, then indictments and people going to jail. Even at this stage it will be seen which poor soul at fbi or doj they scapegoat to protect rats like rosenstien.

Fuck.\n\nSorry folks, I just need to vent. "
'This is really disappointing.  The Democrats started off calling the memo nothing more than groundless assertions and conspiracy theory, and by the time it is actually released, after being watered down and redacted, it will probably appear as such.'

One of the victims was lying on the ground in front of a parking spot where my husband often picks me up. Most of my family live and work in Turku. I was informed about this by my sister who was hiding in a close by building with my brother. My father went by car to get them to safety. Thank goodness my entire family is safe. Sadly this is not true for the people who were there when it happened. As I write this at least two people have died and at least 6 others hurt. On a global scale this was quite a small attack, but Finland is a small country (5.5 million people) and this was our first very likely islamic terror attack. I\'ve been expecting this for a long time, but I feel absolutely devastated. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt\'s not clear what exactly took place, the police will make a (hopefully) full report tomorrow. What I\'ve heard from other Finns and the media is that (please note this is all uncertain info at this point):\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1. A friend\'s co-worker was at the market square and he saw a middle-eastern looking man slit the throat of a woman. He described seeing more than one attacker.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n2. There is short video of three middle-eastern looking men running (video shot from a window) allegedly yelling "allah akbar". At first I thought they were yelling it, but others think they (or someone off the screen) is actually yelling "varo, pois, varokaa" which means "look out, get away, watch out" in Finnish. I\'ve watched the video many times now and I  think they might be right. I have yet to see a report that would substantiate that "allah akbar" was yelled. Alas IMO this is obviously an islamic terror attack, so I\'m not sure if this matters.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n3. The police managed to catch the culprit in 3 minutes and shot him in the lower body. He\'s now at a hospital. The police think he was the only perpetrator, but they are still conducting searches and a friend spotted army helicopters roaming near the Turku docks so I\'m not convinced about that yet. Also some eye witnesses have described seeing more attackers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n4. There have been multiple reports that people attacked the perp with baseball bats chasing him and trying to help the victims. Some of these people were injured. It\'s also alleged that these men were immigrant or middle-eastern men. By tomorrow I guess we will know if this is true, at the moment I tend to believe it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n5. The Finnish police are trying to identify the perp by using international databases so this might indicate that he\'s a refugee or in the country illegally. This is pure speculation though.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n6. Most of the victims were women and one of them was pushing her baby in a carriage. )This one really makes my heart burn with rage.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n7. Our criminal system is horribly lenient, so I\'m not sure what the hell they will do with this guy. For example it took us 23 years to deport  Abdiqadir Osman Hussein, a man who raped children and murdered a 15-year old girl. We don\'t have REAL life sentences so he got out in  <10 years and reoffended within weeks. Then they let him out of prison for vacation (yes... we have prison holidays...) and within a few HOURS he again sexually abused a child. It took ages and tons of taxpayer money to finally deport him to Somalia, where he probably lives happily after ruining countless innocent lives. Our criminal \n system has not been built to handle islamic terrorism or to punish heinous crimes properly. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nTomorrow I fear we will get the basic "don\'t let fear win" speech from either our prime minister or president. Our president seems somewhat reasonable when it comes to immigration, but I\'m not sure he has the balls or actual power to do or say anything. Our prime minister... is a total asshat who, when the European refugee crisis started, offered his second home to refugees (never actually kept that promise). A lot of Finns on Twitter have been more worried about misinformation and racism than the attack itself. We have the "true Finns party" that could maybe do something about immigration and terrorists arriving here, but their power is very limited. The green (super liberal) party has been faring well in the polls lately and I\'m scared that my country is going to hell in a hand basket.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI\'ve been talking to people about the dangers of islam for years. Us Finns have very few kids these days and immigration has been propped up as a solution to fix the dwindling tax base, although every measurable statistic shows that IT\'S NOT SOLVING our financial problems. Vice versa - rape is on the rise and we are spending huge sums on people who will very likely never integrate. I think it\'s important to help people, but it feels wrong that by helping we might lose the feeling of community and safety we\'ve had in this country for a hundred years - It\'s our 100th independence anniversary this year...

'I was going to make the usual meme comment of "Motives unknown" but fuck that shit.\n\nWe know why they attack. They attack because their religion tells them to kill atheists, Christians, Jews and even less devout Muslims. We are dealing with a vile self destructing death cult.  They attack because they hate The West, they hate us.\n\nSeeing us live happy lives and prosper fuels their impotent rage even more to  the point of exploding both figuratively and literally.'

'Am I the only one who sees this shit now and goes "Huh. What\'s new? Next!". And this fact scares the shit out of me. Terrorism is becoming so frequent I am getting numb to it, don\'t even open the stories. Knowing they bring it on themselves doesn\'t help.'
'Today is Friday. In mosques across the country, imams will preach hatred, violence, and death towards Americans and our President and sedition towards our government.

'Damn...the Libs are really ignorant.

I live in chicago and over the past few years it's just become a free-for-all where anyone can do whatever they want and get away with it.  \n\nA majority of these bad guys have multiple violent offences. They get off on very light or no sentences and they're back on the street doing exactly what they've always done. 2 dudes that shot up a restaurant last month were arrested previously for stomping a man to death. They did like 6 years in prison, got out, then shot up a restaurant.  \n\nIt's amazing that we even bother making laws anymore. None of them are enforced."
'These morons think that regulating shit as much as possible is some kind of magic solution to all problems. '
"I think it's called the lautenberg amendment.  We had a scumbag who beat his wife and had to be kicked out in the Army because under that rule he couldn't even carry a weapon in the military, which kind of got in the way of being an infantryman.  \n\nThe dude was a fat shitbag anyway so nothing of value was lost."
'Bad shit happens. Laws must be written and all will be right in the land.'
"Which is still unconstitutional. If you serve your time, so ends your punishment. People have the strangest logic. If you payed your debt to society, you should not be banned from voting nor ownership of guns (when challenged in court, the state ALWAYS caves because they know it's unconstitutional, restoring gun rights; it's a matter of having money for a middle tier lawyer).\n\nAlso, men are disproportionately blamed in domestic violence, even though it's provable what women commit assault equally or more often.\n\nWife, child, cousin, family beatings are not our God damn business nor the government's. It's both families business.  When my cousin's husband beat her, we took care of it as a male relative should. The second part of this story is this retard stayed with him hence we don't help anymore. In real life, women or men are codependent with these abusers less and seek them out or stay with them. Why waste money and time on it?\n\nSame with drugs. Same with guns. Same with families. Same with how many other things in life?"
'A gun for every woman who physically abuses her husband! Yeay! And for the men who beat their wives but also chopped their dicks off and now identify as women, guns for them too!! For the humanoids born with dicks but identify as chicks, extreme vetting, but then sanctuary guns with butt stocks '

"Not a trump supporter so never though I'd post here, way to go Reddit for shutting down all talk about the shooting, but the hopefullness on both sides about the motive and political position of this guy is moronic. Innocent people are dead but you have the right hoping he's anti trump and the left hoping he's for trump. It's disgusting that in this situation, that is what people care about most. Whether you're right or left, I'm sure we can all agree it takes a sick, wackjob to fire into a crowd of innocent, unarmed people. "

'Yeah, no one can convince me that this guy was just deranged, he had a belief system.  You shoot up a country music concert because you hate the type of people who attend it, simple as that.  If he hated blacks, he would have shot up a rap concert.  When people know they\'re going to be doing stuff like this that there\'s no turning back from, they make it count, meaning they take it out on the type of people they hate the most.  You for example, won\'t see a Trump supporter go and shoot up a Trump rally.  Won\'t happen.  \n\nIn all the confusion and uncertainty, these are the truly certain things, that people have belief systems against those they kill in mass murders.  \n\nOf course, the left can\'t paint the guy as a racist, because he didn\'t shoot up a black concert.  They can\'t paint him as a Trump supporter, because he shot up a country music concert likely full of conservatives.  So the story will just be "we will never know the motives", then they will use this tragedy to try to push for irrelevant gun control laws that wouldn\'t have made a difference.  The left will never own up to that this guy was likely a liberal committing a politically or ideologically motivated terrorist genocide.  They will just try to muddle the reality into "we won\'t ever know", when if you use common sense, it\'s easy to see that we already do know.  '

'Remember Pearl Harbor!\n\nToday I also remember my Grandpa.  He was on the USS Helena that fateful morning. They were moved into the dock normally occupied by the Pennsylvania, the flagship of the fleet. This made them one of the first targets, they were also recorded as one the first to return fire.  I still have the lock he had to cut off the service ammunition locker that opened up the first American shots of the war. He had the grim task with others to clear the bodies from the flooded and sealed compartments in the days that followed. After repair and refit they headed out to take on the Japanese in the South Pacific.  The Helena was in several major engagements around Guadalcanal and provided shore battery support for the Marines taking the island.  The ship was ultimately sunk near there at the Battle of the Kula Gulf. He made it through 3 Japanese torpedos and later a Kamikaze. His final duty of the war was going on a mail run through the ruins of Nagasaki after they surrended, one of the very few that were there at the opening shots and there after the final one was made.\nI was fortunate to hear many stories about that day and the battles he was involved with afterwards. Will always remember!'
"I was at my Japanese grandmother's house this morning and asked her if she knew it was the anniversary of pearl harbor. She was living in Japan as a child when Japan attacked pearl harbor.

General Douglas MacArthur left his men to surrender, with his ‚ÄúI shall return‚Äù speech, and the Bataan Death March ensued. \n\nMy uncle survived the seige of Corregidor, the Bataan Death March, the Hell Ships, and 3 & 1/2 years of slave labor as a  POW. He also witnessed the Nagasaki bomb blast while at Fukuoka Camp 17 in Omuta, Japan. \n\nThat‚Äôs another thing people don‚Äôt realize. There were *HUNDREDS* of POW Camps in Japan. They gave those men only a handful of rice to eat per day, and they ate any grasshopper, cricket, cockroach, mouse, rat or monkey that they could get their hands on. \n\nNot trying to take away from December 7th.

'#1000 seems to be a timeline about Oswald.

Oct 10 a cable about Oswald contacting Russian embassy was sent from CIA to State, FBI, and Navy, with erroneous description which was corrected by HQ later (imposter in Mexico theory?).

'# 708 In Sept 1963, Castro gave an interview to media. This was unusual for him. He said that American leaders would not be safe if the US made attempts on the lives of Cuban leaders. Blasted Kennedy and Senator Goldwater.  The writer of this report believes that Oswald, an avid newspaper reader, read this report in his hometown paper and took it as instructions. He seems concerned that Warren Commission forgot about it.  Says Oswald attempted to kill General Walker in April 1963 and devolved into pathology.  His Marine Corps buddy said he bragged about being friends with Cuban diplomats in 1959.  In 1962, Zabola, Communist Party Cell leader, said Kennedy was no concern because he would die that year. On November 7, 1963, Cuban Third Secretary was discussing refugee raids and told diplomat "Just you wait. You will see what we can do. It will happen soon."  Cuban embassy employee Luisa (maybe Calderon with Cuban Intel) joked on phone with unidentifiable male in hours after assassination that she knew it "almost before Kennedy."  Concern that Mexican consul refused Warren Commission request to interrogate Silvia Duran. She apparently had sec with Oswald in Mexico City.  Witness saw Oswald get money at Cuban embassy.

'Here\'s what Islam teaches about women.\n\nOn wives:\n\n* An [imam in South Carolina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=XvZEDu2D_RQ) stated that a husband is the "owner" and "ruler" of a wife who must obey him as his "prisoner." \n* Wives are confined to their houses and must get a man\'s permission to leave them. Koran 33:32-33\n* Wives have to stop what they\'re doing whenever their husbands demand sex, and give it to them. Jami at-Tirmidhi 1160\n* Wives cannot refuse sex. Sunan Ibn Majah 1853\n* Raping your wife is allowed. Koran 2:223\n* Wives can be raped in any position. Sunan Abu Dawud 2159\n* Wives can be beaten. Koran 4:34, Ishaq 969, Muslim 4:2127, Abu Dawud 2141 and 2142 \n* Wives should stay in abusive marriages. Bukhari 72:715\n* The most important thing a woman brings to marriage is unrestricted access to her vagina. Sahih Bukhari 62:81  \n* The "best" Muslim wife is one who is attractive, obeys her husband\'s commands, and doesn\'t go against her husband or do anything he disproves of. Al-Tirmidhi 3272 \n* Men can have 4 wives but women can only have one husband. Koran 4:3\n* Husbands can swap wives. Koran 4:20\n* A "disobedient" wife can be replaced and men can rotate as many women as he pleases in and out of the four-wife lineup. Koran 66:5, Sahih Bukhari 58:125\n* Men can "marry" little girls (pedophilia). Koran 65.4\n* Mohammed so controlled his wives that they were trained to defecate on his command. Sahih Bukhari 4:149\n\nOn woman in general:\n\n* Men are in charge of women. Koran 4:34\n* Men decide how women dress. Koran 33:59\n* Women can be beaten. Tabari IX:113\n* Women are stupid. Sahih Bukhari 6:301, Sahih al-Bukhari 2658\n* Women are beneath men. Koran 2:228 \n* Women are interchangeable. Ishaq 734\n* Women must cover themselves. Koran 24:31 and 33:59, Bukhari 6:321, Abu Dawud 2:641\n* Women cannot travel without a man. Bukhari 52:250\n* Women comprise the majority of occupants in Muslim "hell." Sahih Bukhari 2:18:161, 7:62:125, 54:464; Sahih Muslim 36: 6600\n* If a husband goes to hell, his wife goes with him. Koran 37:22-23\n* A woman\'s court testimony is worth only half of man\'s. Koran 2:282\n* Women are equal to dogs, donkeys, pigs, and monkeys. Sahih Bukhari 1.9.490, 493, 498; Sahih Muslim 4.1039; Sunaan Abu Dawud 11.2155; Mishkat ul-Masabih vol 2, p.114\n* Women are compared to slaves and camels with regard to the "evil" in them. Abu Dawud 2155\n* Mohammed treated women like party favors, handing them out as rape slave rewards to his men. Ishaq 878\n* Women, dogs, and donkeys invalidate a man‚Äôs prayer. Musnad Ibn Hanbal, vol. 2, p. 2992 \n* A nation with a woman as its leader cannot succeed. Sahih Bukhari 88:219 \n* The Koran explicitly permits women to be kept as rape slaves. Koran 4:24 \n* Rape *victims* are the [criminals.](https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/17/world/in-pakistan-rape-victims-are-the-criminals.html)\n\nIslamic scholar al-Ghazali says in *The Revival of Religious Sciences* that a Muslim woman:\n\n* must stay at home \n* must not go out often\n* must not be well-informed\n* must not be communicative with neighbors \n* must satisfy her husband in everything\n* must be ready to satisfy her husband\'s sexual needs at any moment\n\nEleven of the 12 countries with the [highest rate of discrimination against women are Muslim-majority countries.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NXtIUv5i2w)\n\nMuslim men can marry non-Muslims but Muslim women cannot. A Muslim woman is never to be without the guardianship of a man, from her father to her husband then back to the male members of her family when she\'s a widow. A Muslim woman cannot be alone with a man who isn\'t her relative. Stonings, honor killings, floggings and the [mutilation of female genitalia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7o9Pv3F100) are all employed in the Muslim world to keep women in their place.\n\nCleric [Abu Ishaq al-Huwaini](http://freethoughtnation.com/contributing-writers/63-acharya-s/539-egyptian-muslim-cleric-when-i-want-a-sex-slave-i-go-to-the-market-and-buy-her.html) has called for a return of slave markets, where Muslim men can order rape slaves. In this man\'s ideal world, "when I want a sex-slave, I go to the market and pick whichever female I desire and buy her."\n\n[More here about what a woman is worth in Islam](https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/quran/women-worth-less.aspx).\n\n[More here about Mohammed\'s hatred of women](https://www.islam-watch.org/Larry/Islam-hatred-of-women.htm).\n\n[Three Koran Verses Every Woman Should Know](http://www.answeringmuslims.com/2016/05/three-quran-verses-every-woman-should.html)\n\n----------------------\nThe Koran is indistinguishable from any other form of hate literature.\n\nDo not be fooled.

"I don't think this is as horrendous as it is made out to be. Dead babies aren't being sold to witchdoctors.

These tissues are being sold to pharmaceutical companies in order to conduct stem cell research. Regardless of your stance on abortion, you shouldn't be against fetal tissue being used for research when the alternative (at this moment) is labeling the tissues as bio waste and destroying them.\n\nMy only issue is that these tissues are being sold rather than donated.

There was no evidence of that included in our report."\n\nMarch 20 Comey testified for the first time that there is a Russia/campaign  investigation. Clapper said nothing, no tweet, no interview. then May 8:\n\n> Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., quoted Clapper‚Äôs exchange on Meet The Press in a May 8 Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and asked if it was still accurate. **Clapper responded, "It is."**\n\nThen suddenly after Comey is fired a week later Clapper re-appears and testifies that  **he never knew about the FBI investigatio**n, Comey didn\'t tell him and that\'s normal. They issued a joint report on Russia interference, he is the director of national intelligence - but he had **no idea** about the FBI investigation going on since June 2016. Clapper heard about for the first time March 20 - then didn\'t say anything about it, then testified under oath  May 8 that his statement of no collusion is still accurate... only NOW he finally remembered this detail. \n\nThen he gets trotted out on like 5 different Sunday morning talk shows and repeats the same prepared statement, that "No evidence of collusion" actually means "FBI never told be about their Russia investigation when we released our joint report on the Russia investigation.

Moreover, the removal of confederate statues isn\'t about democrats not being able to stand their own history. It\'s about brainwashed people thinking those statues represent something they don\'t. \n\nIt is ridiculous that people are blaming Trump for all of this though. Nazi scum only came out of the woodwork because they feel emboldened, not by Trump, but by BLM and antifa. They\'ve lain low for a while now, then they see equally repugnant groups out there and think, "well I guess it\'s okay to do this in public again." \n\nAs for the statues themselves, I think it\'s a failure of our educational system that people think they represent racism or what have you. Monuments represent soldiers who died fighting for their country and families, nearly all of which who did not have slaves. We are a bellicose country with a martial history, we tend to honor soldiers no matter who they fought for. Look at how Rommel is admired in the West. Some of the Confederate victories are studied around the world as excellent examples of a smaller army defeating a larger one. The monuments also represent our country\'s failure, morally and diplomatically. Something that should be in the forefront of our minds right now, given all the civil strife; a warning of what can happen.\n\n'

"I am conflicted. Ryan did a lot more in the house then the senate ever got done. Doesn't mean he isn't a swamp rat and pushed his fair share of globalist garbage. Ryan was easy to manipulate when Trump would alert the people about his swampiness. The problem with this is that there are so many Republicans jumping ship. It gives the appearance that we are weak when we need to be strong and united. If we had a united party in the senate, McCain would have already been forced out. He is literally just holding up votes. Ryan almost always got the right votes in the house, which was likely no easy task. So my hats off to the guy for getting tax reform done, but we need him to put a new speaker in charge sooner rather than later. A guy who is leaving office will not be as motivated to carry out Trump's agenda. He is a lame duck just stealing oxygen at this point."

'Donald, tell them the changes that must be made. They will not figure it out.\n\nEDIT: My suggestions:\n\n- Ensure settling citizens have an interest in assimilating into the host country‚Äôs culture. Anything other than this, is a recipe for conflict. ‚ÄúImmigration without assimilation is invasion.‚Äù\n\n- Slow down incoming waves of refugees. Not all ‚Äúrefugees‚Äù are actually refugees in the traditional sense. In WWII, there were Jewish refugees denied from western countries who were sent back to places where they were killed. That risk doesn‚Äôt exist for 99.9% of people claiming refugee status. Economic ‚Äúrefugees‚Äù are immigrants, not refugees.\n\n- Provide logistical and financial aid to struggling countries, give opportunities for people to make their homelands safer and more prosperous. (This can be done through investment and business dealings, it doesn‚Äôt NEED to be charity.) Why? Big movements of immigrants hurts everyone. The home country suffers from the loss of well-intentioned people, only bad actors remain, problems get worse, and more people leave. It‚Äôs a negative feedback loop. And the new host country suffers from the weight of supporting huge amounts of people, and suffers from the clash of cultures that do not cleanly mesh in a single society.\n\n- Support and amplify the voices of reformers within Islam. \n\n- Deport any immigrant that commits a crime, from littering to murder. Deport any immigrant that rallies against the host country‚Äôs values. Meaning any immigrant in marches for the implementation of sharia ‚Äî OUT NOW. If you want to take this a step further (maybe too far), deport immediate family too.\n\n- Give more refugees TEMPORARY stay, vs. limitless stay. \n\n- End or limit chain migration.\n\n- Promote host culture, host language, host history. Keep street signs in native language. \n\n- Problematic areas must be reset. Absolutely no ghettos, no go-zones. Attempt peacefully to restore order, anyone who uses violence in response, arrested and deported.'

For starters, you can shut down mosques that spew the hateful passages of the Quran which is where all the terrorists are learning about these options. Until you do that this will never change and will just increase in frequency.

'Those who call themselves "feminists" in the west today are pretty much anti-feminists by historical standards. They are a lose knit group of female supremacists, communist deconstructionists, pro-sharia muslims, and gender-subjectivity activists.\n\nThe first are not feminists by historic standards because they want supremacy, not equality.\n\nThe second may want equality, but their activism is only connected to women\'s issues by proxy, their true goal is to destroy western society and capitalism in general. These are the ones who talk about a "racist, sexist, capitalist patriarchy".\n\nThird are those like Huma Abedin who claim to fight for women\'s rights while pushing the hijab on everyone, trying to tell people Islam is feminist, meanwhile women are stoned to death for being a victim of rape in Islamic countries. The Hijab is not a choice under Islam, even if the law technically isn\'t Islamic, they are publicly shamed and ostracized in their communities if they don\'t wear it.\n\nAnd the gender-subjectivity activists use "feminism" as a platform while pushing the idea that gender is just a social construct, so there really isn\'t any such thing as male or female. What they are fighting for is not equality, it\'s monotony. They want everyone to be regarded exactly the same, as if they are the exact same person. It might sound idealistic at first, to be treated the same as everyone else. Until you realize you are a 4\'6 110lbs woman and you are expected to work as hard as a 6\'2 220 lbs man. These are the people who claim they can switch gender any time they want, and suddenly you have to use a different pronoun. Every time you talk to them you have to ask their pronouns, because you don\'t know if they changed it since the last time.'
'The goal of the enemy is to eliminate white Conservative Christian males (WCCM) and the society and culture they created..  They are the ones most likely to resist their country being destroyed.  \n\nFeminism is just a tool to use against WCCM,  Obviously real women are not that important to it.'

'That\'s not why they were banned.  You\'re doing no better than the hundreds of comments in that thread going "But what about Breitbart??", because they didn\'t read past the title either.\n\nThey weren\'t banned because of the (lack of) quality of their work, their corruption, their dishonesty, or the fact that they\'re literally propaganda (all true) - they were banned for breaking a rule that employees of a news company can\'t post and upvote submissions from their company.  They did it once, the mods made a new rule and warned them, they did it again, and got banned.\n\nThis obviously appears to be a technicality.  I\'m a bit shocked seeing them ban ShareBlue seeing how hard the moderators shill and are biased themselves to the left.  I can\'t help but feel there banning was for a different reason, and this was just a manufactured justification.'

">In this way the activists are able to maintain the illusion that they are rebelling against the System. But the illusion is absurd. Agitation against racism, sexism, homophobia and the like no more constitutes rebellion against the System than does agitation against political graft and corruption. Those who work against graft and corruption are not rebelling but acting as the System's enforcers: They are helping to keep the politicians obedient to the rules of the System. Those who work against racism, sexism, and homophobia similarly are acting as the Systems' enforcers: They help the System to suppress the deviant racist, sexist, and homophobic attitudes that cause problems for the System.\n\n>But the activists don't act only as the System's enforcers. They also serve as a kind of lightning rod that protects the System by drawing public resentment away from the System and its institutions. For example, there were several reasons why it was to the System's advantage to get women out of the home and into the workplace. Fifty years ago, if the System, as represented by the government or the media, had begun out of the blue a propaganda campaign designed to make it socially acceptable for women to center their lives on careers rather than on the home, the natural human resistance to change would have caused widespread public resentment. What actually happened was that the changes were spearheaded by radical feminists, behind whom the System's institutions trailed at a safe distance. The resentment of the more conservative members of society was directed primarily against the radical feminists rather than against the System and its institutions, because the changes sponsored by the System seemed slow and moderate in comparison with the more radical solutions advocated by feminists, and even these relatively slow changes were seen as having been forced on the System by pressure from the radicals. \n\nTed Kaczynski, [The System's Neatest Trick](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/ted-kaczynski-the-system-s-neatest-trick)"

"Rod Rosenstein needs to be put under oath to answer some questions.\n\nRod Rosenstein: \n\nSigned FISA application(s) extending surveillance on Trump team because muh Russia.\n\nWrote a memo to AG Sessions and President Trump outlining why Comey should be fired as FBI Director two weeks after being confirmed as Deputy AG. \n\nAppointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller. \n\n***Why did he want a Special Counsel in the first place?***\n\nTo look into Russia? There were already active FBI investigations looking into that *with a FISA warrant.* What could Mueller find that the *FISA warrant* couldn't? So was it to investigate whether the firing of Comey obstructed this investigation? He recommended Comey's firing! And Comey himself testified that his firing would not and could not impede the Russia investigation. \n\nThere is only one answer: the FISA warrant expired and could no longer be renewed, so they needed another way to continue digging dirt on the Trump team. And they still have nothing after a year. A couple perjury trap indictments. That's it. Why is the Mueller investigation still going on, and why did it start in the first place? Put Rod Rosenstein in the hot seat. Now."

So Acosta decided to read this poem, whine, and repeatedly interrupt over and over to try and derail Miller.\n\nI want Stephen Miller to be the Comms Director. He, more than anyone else, has been the intellectual force behind the Trump administration\'s ideas, and he does a FANTASTIC job of explaining the reasoning behind everything. He has an answer for every bullshit premise that these liberal journalists throw at him. He knows more than all of them combined about these subjects.\n\nAlso, Acosta needs to be tossed the fuck out of the WH Press Briefing, that was completely inexcusable. It\'s not a fucking debate, Acosta, and you aren\'t running for the position of White House Policy Advisor. You ask your questions, Stephen Miller answers them. You don\'t get to butt in after every 10 words with a response.'

He should have been escorted out of the building, press pass revoked and then had his ass kicked by an english-speaking immigrant.'
'You get questions like this when you allow the idiocy of the thought that "Illegal Immigration" and "Legal Immigration" are one in the same thing.\n\nSo when your world view is based on such a stupid thought that there is no difference, a move against one, effects both.\n\nIt really is casting a bright light on how dumb most of these "journalists" are.\n\n'

They'd call me wall or green card or something and when all the new hires asked why they called me that someone would sit them down and tell the story of how I thought a wall would prevent green cards."
'Jim Acosta\'s comeback is "Stephen are you trying to engineer the racial and ethnic flow into our country?"\n\nEven that is full of holes, by definition that is WHAT POLICY IS. \n\nIt\'s only racist people like Jim who equate RACE = work ethic, skills, language abilities. \n\nThere are nuances and I\'m not against common sense allowances. But seeing the blanket statement MSM bullshit propaganda thrown in their faces on national television is PRICELESS. \n\nHonestly we need more of this attack mode. '

You will see them often on MSM, they aren "experts", typically from the universities, who are brought onto the show to tell us all how we need to change our culture and our way of life. They are the ones who tell the schools to push the gender bender nonsense on children. They are the ones who sit back and brainstorm ways to make communism "hip and cool" for the youth. They are the ones who probably created the whole "Trump is a Nazi" talking point that was circulated to every media outlet and artificially tending on social media.\n\nEdit 2: And I would be willing to bet anything that social engineers are the ones who pushed this "Trump throws brown babies in concentration camps" bullshit. Notice how the story broke big one day, then suddenly the leftist media all deleted their posts because it got called out that Obama was doing that... Then 2 days later the same story is back full-force, and they just conveniently ignore the part about the pics being from 2014? Why would they bring back the same story after such a massive fail 2 days ago? Because someone TOLD THEM TO push it. They pulled back at first, they said "man we can\'t do that. This will never work, it\'s too obviously bullshit". But the social engineers said do it anyway. "Ignore the facts and just push the fucking story.

It hasn't changed but the police has more violent crimes to solve, shoplifting isn't even prosecuted anymore if you stay below certain limits.  \nThe total numbers are lower but the numbers of rape, murder, body harm have rissen.

None of the things the 3 "accusers" allege in the WaPo article are actually crimes (no one under age, no sexual acts, he asked their mothers\' permission to date them for Pete\'s sake) so they aren\'t actionable.\n\nUsing that smear to falsely claim that this "backs up" an accusation of child-molestation 40-years ago for the first time ever days before an election **should** be actionable, but the beauty of making up false allegation claiming things happened 40-years ago is the discovery process is impossible - the burden of proof is on the accuser if they take their allegation to court, but the burden is on Moore is he sues for defamation. *That\'s how the scam works and why they did it.*'

But when you are invited, then enter; and when you have eaten, disperse without seeking to remain for conversation. Indeed, that [behavior] was troubling the Prophet, and he is shy of [dismissing] you. But Allah is not shy of the truth. And when you ask [his wives] for something, ask them from behind a partition.

Perjury trap,  Lock a UK citizen up who‚Äôs wife Is pregnant and charged with a felony. Stone is in trouble for joking he ‚Äúdined with Assange‚Äù in an email. He absolutely did not. He was being Flamboyant Stone and it was probably about those DMs which is hardly dining. Manafort might be the one real scum here and he‚Äôs tied to Podesta. He‚Äôs facing 305 years.  Mueller may very well make that man live out his remaining years in a high security fed prison.  Thats a death sentence.  The only way out Is when ya keel over. \n\nAND, Mueller totally fucked Manafort today because he was led to believe based on known information, his money concerns were Ukrainian and nothing with Russia so it should be dropped. Mueller waited until the very last second and said ‚Äúoops forgot.  Rod Rosenstein told me last August I could.‚Äù \n\nNo his defense has just wasted value time to prepare a defense. \n\nI bet technically Trump isn‚Äôt a target..

"Honestly this means nothing, this is exactly what I would do to get Trump to drop his guard. I don't believe for a second Mueller doesn't have a stronger force then gravity on his shoulders to find something on Trump.

I wouldn't be surprised if this investigation drags out close to the next election and right before then Mueller will announce Trump as a possible criminal suspect whether Mueller had dirt or not just to have maximum impact.

Someone was paid to kill Seth Rich that night, and if there was anything to indicate it was a "robbery" like video footage, it was probably the cover for the hit: pretend to rob him, then the robbery goes "bad" and you just shoot him, then run away.

I am just baffled at how they don\'t see that 99% of hollywood is to the left. Laura Ingram was speaking out against that phrase as it applies to the left with the harsh language. The left is the epitome of the phrase, "we only want free thinking when it agrees with us" - this whole fucking platform is the epitome of left leaning groupthink. Even hollywood itself bullies people into agreeing with leftist thinking.  They locked the post because dissent was happening - the post itself is ironic. Fuck. I loathe the American left.

"> you have to come to terms with the fact that everything you know is a lie.\n\nThis is the hard part. Built into people is the idea of trusting authorities. This is one of the key human distinctions, and it is built into parent-child dynamics that have helped us build on prior generations information.\n\nBut the lazy elites of the world have co-opted this otherwise beneficial trait to build up fake authorities.\n\nA true authority should not ever limit access to information. A true authority should be so open that anyone can check their sources.\n\nThis is the big clue to look for. Is the source checkable all the way down to the data collection process. If that part is hidden from you, then that information is suspect. The collection process should have been open from the beginning, not merely after the data is tabulated. \n\nThe trick they are using is hiding their data collection efforts, then cherry picking the data that fits their agenda. Or, more recently, they just lie, and give no source.\n\nIt is so hard when the people we are taught to trust collude against us to hide information. Once you see it in action, it's like finding out that all your old heroes were secretly villains in disguise.\n\nKudos to Alex Jones on naming the battle. It really is an info war we are fighting. The villains of the story are totally willing to lie, maybe even kill, to keep their control over access to information.\n"

The swamp must be drained, bulldozed, sanitized, and remade. \n\nI myself strongly feel President Trump while very powerful, will not be able to do this alone.

"Non-Muslims Worse Than Animals\n\n\nhttp://www.islam-watch.org/AbulKasem/Non-Muslims-Worse-than-Animals.htm\n\n\nNon-Muslims: Worse than Animals By: Jamie Glazov FrontPageMagazine.com | Thursday, July 03, 2008\n\n\nFrontpage Interview‚Äôs guest today is Abul Kasem, an ex-Muslim who is the author of hundreds of articles and several books on Islam including, Women in Islam. He was a contributor to the book Leaving Islam ‚Äì Apostates Speak Out as well as to Beyond Jihad: Critical Views From Inside Islam. He writes from Sydney, Australia and can be reached at nirribilli@gmail.com.\n\n\nFP: Abul Kasem, welcome to Frontpage Interview.\n\n\nKasem: Thank you.\n\n\nFP: We are here today to discuss how Islam views non-Muslims. What is the best way to start this discussion?\n\n\nKasem: Those who have not read the Qur‚Äôan in detail have very little idea about the unremitting hatred Allah has for the non-Muslims. One striking aspect of Islam‚Äôs unbound rage and hatred for the unbelievers is that Allah is obsessed with tagging the unbelievers with animals‚Äîvarious types, such as dogs, camels, cows, pigs, apes, goat and so on.\n\n\nFP: Can you share some verses from the Qur‚Äôan, ahadith, and other important sources in Islam on this theme?\n\n\nKasem: Sure. Allah sees unbelievers as worse than animals. Let us start with verse 8:55 of the Qur‚Äôan. In essence this verse says: the unbelievers are the worst beasts (or worst animals) in the eyes of Allah.\n\n\nAccording to ibn Abbas and Jalalyn, the most eminent exegetes of the Qur‚Äôan, Allah revealed this verse regarding the B. Qurayzah Jews. These Jews had unconditionally surrendered to Muhammad‚Äôs invading army. Earlier, Muhammad had asked these hapless Jews, comprising of women children and adult males, to convert to Islam if they wanted to be reprieved from the genocide that was pronounced on them by the judge appointed by Muhammad. But these Jews steadfastly refused to embrace Islam, preferring death instead. So, when they turned down Muhammad‚Äôs offer of ‚Äòmercy‚Äô, around 700 to 900 of the adult males were beheaded right in front of Muhammad. Muhammad‚Äôs companions participated in this orgy of beheadings. This was similar to the scene of an abattoir where animals are driven to be slaughtered by Islamic swords and knives.\n\n\nCommenting on this frenzy of slaughter of these Jews, ibn Kathir, another eminent tafsir writer, writes that the unbelievers who do not embrace Islam and break treaties are the worst moving creatures on earth; Muslims should punish them harshly and inflict heavy casualties among them.\n\n\nIn Qur‚Äôan 25:44, Allah says that unbelievers are worse than cattle and animals.\nIbn Kathir provides the reason why non-Muslims are worse than animals and grazing cattle: cattle only do what they were created to do, but these people were created to worship Allah alone without associating partners with Him, but they worship others with Him, even though evidence has been established against them and Messengers have been sent to them.\n\n\nAllah hurls further insults to the Jews and Christians if they do not accept the Qur‚Äôan. Allah says in Qur‚Äôan 4:47 that the Qur‚Äôan confirms the books sent before it; the people of the book are cursed if they do not believe in the Qur‚Äôan. Because of this calumny Allah may efface their faces. According to ibn Kathir effacing means turning them blind; turn their faces backward means to put their faces on their backs and make them walk backwards, and curse them means to turn them into animals.\n\n\nAllah says in Qur‚Äôan 6:122 that He raises the believers from the dead and provides them with light to enable them to move among the disbelievers; but the unbelievers move in total darkness.\n\n\nCommenting on this verse Maulana Abul Ala Maududi, a modern exegete of the Qur‚Äôan writes (Tafheem ul Quran commentary number 6/88):\n\n\n'Death' signifies here the state of ignorance and lack of consciousness, whereas 'life' denotes the state of knowledge and true cognition, the state of awareness of Reality. He, who cannot distinguish between right and wrong and does not know the Straight Way for human life, may be alive on the biological plane, but his essential humanity is not. He may be a living animal but is certainly not a living human being. A living human being is one who can distinguish right from wrong, good from evil, honesty from dishonesty.\n\n\nReaders should note that ‚ÄòStraight Way‚Äô means Islam. The gist of Maududi‚Äôs comment is that a human being who does not accept Islam is a living animal.\n\n\nFP: So what should happen to these lowest of animals according to Islam?\n\n\nKasem: Islam decrees that they be slaughtered Islamically, just in the manner as animals are killed, that is, by beheading.\n\n\nIn Sunaan ibn Majah (hadis number 4.3126) we read that the blood of animals is very dear to Allah, and therefore, one must slaughter animals to please Allah (hadis number 4.3167). Since non-Muslims are animals it is evident that Allah has a great penchant for the blood of infidels.\n\n\nFP: What are some of the most disturbing verses in terms of all of this?\n\n\nKasem: Qur‚Äôan 7:176-177 will profoundly disturb many non-Muslims. In verse 7:176 Allah says those who reject faith are like panting dogs; preaching to them is a waste of time. Maulana Maududi writes (commentary number 7/139):\n\n\n‚Ä¶This is followed by a statement in which God likens the person in question to a dog. A dog's protruding tongue and the unceasing flow of saliva from his mouth symbolize unquenchable greed and avarice. The reason for likening the human character described above to a dog is because of his excessive worldliness‚Ä¶ This metaphor of the dog highlights the fate of the worldly man who breaks loose from his faith and knowledge, who entrusts his reins to blind lust and who ends up as one wholly devoted to gratifying his own appetite.\n\n\nWhat Maududi is says is quite clear: those who do not accept Islam are greedy dogs.\nFurther, in verse 7:177 Allah says: Those who reject the Qur‚Äôan, wrong themselves; they are evil. According to ibn Abbas, their example is that of a dog.\n\n\nFP: After killing unbelievers, what does one do with their corpses?\n\n\nKasem: Unbelievers‚Äô corpses are to be fed to dogs.\n\n\nSince Allah likens the non-Muslims to dogs, it is just fair that their corpses be fed to the dogs. Thus in Ash Shifa (Ash ‚ÄìShifa of Qadi ‚ÄòIyad. Translated by Aisha Abdarrahman Bewley. Madinah Press, P.O. Box 5531. Inverness, IV5 7YA, Scotland, U.K. 2004. ISBN: 1 874216262. p.411) we read:\n\n\nIf a Jew or a Christian reviles Muhammad he is beheaded.\n\n\nIn an An Nawadir (footnote 1: A book by Ibn Abi Zayd, author of the Risala) from the version of Sahnum from Malik, we find that any Jew or Christian who reviles the Prophet in any other than normal way by which the Jews and Christians reject him is beheaded unless he becomes a Muslim.\n\n\nIf a Christian reviles Muhammad kill him and let the dog eat his corpse.\n\n\nAbu‚Äôl Mus‚Äôab said, ‚ÄúA Christian was brought to me who said, ‚ÄúBy the One who chose ‚Äòisa over Muhammad/.‚Äô There was a dispute about him before me. So I beat him until I killed him, or he lived for a day and a night. I commanded someone to drag him by the feet and throw him into a dung heap and the dogs ate him.‚Äù\n\n\nIn case readers have doubt about the ‚Äòpurity‚Äô of Ash Shifa, this is what is written at the back of this famous Islamic book:\n\n\nKitab Ash-Shifa bi tar‚Äôrif huquq al Mustafa (Healing by the recognition of the Rights of the Chosen One), of Qadi ‚ÄòIyad (d. 544H/1149CE) is perhaps the most frequently used and commented upon handbook in which the Prophet‚Äôs life, his qualities and his miracles are described in every detail. Generally known by its short title, Ash Shifa, this work was so highly admired throughout the Muslim world that it soon acquired a sanctity of its own for it is said: ‚ÄúIf Ash Shifa is found in a house, this house will not suffer any harm‚Ä¶when a sick person reads it or it is recited to him, Allah s.w.t. will restore his health.‚Äù\n\n\nAsh Shifa gathers together all that is necessary to acquaint the reader with the true stature of the Prophet, peace and blessing be upon him, with the esteem and respect which is due to him, and with the verdict regarding anyone who does not fulfill what his stature demand or who attempts to denigrate his supreme status‚Äîeven by as much as a nail pairing.\n\n\nTherefore, we should have no doubt that in Islam a non-Muslim‚Äôs corpse is worth dog food.\n\n\nFP: I imagine that the Jews have a special category in all of these descriptions.\n\n\nKasem: Of course. Jews are apes and swine\n\n\nThanks to the power of the Internet, today the world has become aware of the extreme hatred that Islam possesses for the Jews. Islam views the Jews as monkeys and pigs‚Äîperhaps the two most despicable animals in the eyes of Allah.\n\n\n\n"

"Islam is the greatest killer of all time, worse than Christianity, fascism or communism. Islamic jihad destroyed a Christian Middle East and a Christian North Africa. Soon it was the fate of the Persian Zoroastrian and the Hindu to be the victims of jihad. The history of political Islam is the destruction of Christianity in the Middle East, Egypt, Turkey and North Africa. Half of Christianity was lost. Before Islam, North Africa was the southern part of Europe (part of the Roman Empire). Around 60 million Christians were slaughtered during the jihadic conquest. Half of the glorious Hindu civilization was annihilated and 80 million Hindus killed. The first Western Buddhists were the Greeks descended from Alexander the Great's army in what is now Afghanistan. Jihad destroyed all of Buddhism along the silk route. About 10 million Buddhists died. The conquest of Buddhism is the practical result of pacifism. Zoroastrianism was eliminated from Persia. The Jews became permanent dhimmis throughout Islam. In Africa over 120 million Christians and animists have died over the last 1400 years of jihad. Approximately 270 million nonbelievers died over the last 1400 years for the glory of political Islam. These are the Tears of Jihad which are not taught in any school.\n\n\nThese figures are a rough estimate of the death of non-Muslims by the political act of jihad.\n\n\nAfrica\n\n\nThomas Sowell [Thomas Sowell, Race and Culture, BasicBooks, 1994, p. 188] estimates that 11 million slaves were shipped across the Atlantic and 14 million were sent to the Islamic nations of North Africa and the Middle East. For every slave captured many others died. Estimates of this collateral damage vary. The renowned missionary David Livingstone estimated that for every slave who reached a plantation, five others were killed in the initial raid or died of illness and privation on the forced march.[Woman‚Äôs Presbyterian Board of Missions, David Livingstone, p. 62, 1888] Those who were left behind were the very young, the weak, the sick and the old. These soon died since the main providers had been killed or enslaved. So, for 25 million slaves delivered to the market, we have an estimated death of about 120 million people. Islam ran the wholesale slave trade in Africa.\n\n\n120 million Africans\n\n\nChristians\n\n\nThe number of Christians martyred by Islam is 9 million [David B. Barrett, Todd M. Johnson, World Christian Trends AD 30-AD 2200, William Carey Library, 2001, p. 230, table 4-10] . A rough estimate by Raphael Moore in History of Asia Minor is that another 50 million died in wars by jihad. So counting the million African Christians killed in the 20th century we have:\n\n\n60 million Christians\n\n\nHindus\n\n\nKoenard Elst in Negationism in India gives an estimate of 80 million Hindus killed in the total jihad against India. [Koenard Elst, Negationism in India, Voice of India, New Delhi, 2002, pg. 34.] The country of India today is only half the size of ancient India, due to jihad. The mountains near India are called the Hindu Kush, meaning the ‚Äúfuneral pyre of the Hindus.‚Äù\n\n\n80 million Hindus\n\n\nBuddhists\n\n\nBuddhists do not keep up with the history of war. Keep in mind that in jihad only Christians and Jews were allowed to survive as dhimmis (servants to Islam) everyone else had to convert or die. Jihad killed the Buddhists in Turkey, Afghanistan, along the Silk Route, and in India. The total is roughly 10 million. [David B. Barrett, Todd M. Johnson, World Christian Trends AD 30-AD 2200, William Carey Library, 2001, p. 230, table 4-1.]\n\n\n10 million Buddhists\n\n\nJews\n\n\nOddly enough there were not enough Jews killed in jihad to significantly affect the totals of the Great Annihilation. The jihad in Arabia was 100 percent effective, but the numbers were in the thousands, not millions. After that, the Jews submitted and became the dhimmis (servants and second class citizens) of Islam and did not have geographic political power.\n\n\nThis gives a rough estimate of 270 million killed by jihad. The real history of the Crusades, a just response to over 350 years of genocidal Islamic Jihad:\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-uFKpVqq4w\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmgMEu_9n1s\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfxzFELB8To\n"

Considering the impact and cost of the Cold War and where it left us in our relationship with Russia (another of our allies in WW2, which is easily forgotten) a cold front and hard stance from America post-war might have ended Europe and Britain from playing any part in global affairs, forever. There‚Äôs no knowing how many different ways WW2 might have ended, but we know it ended the way it did, with an Allied victory, because America came to our aide. Trump is right about NATO, right about the EU and, shamefully, is right about the British government, who aren‚Äôt just betraying Trump‚Äôs America, but also their own people.

Her information has SOME value, though-- you've just got to carefully corroborate all of it with other sources and other things we know to be true. \n\nI read everything that the opposition writes to learn everything I can about them, so I'm reading her book now. She gives very specific examples of Clinton/DNC fuckups in her book. Many of these things can be verified. For example, we first learned about the DNC/Clinton financing structure from her book-- she specifically writes about the contract between the Clinton campaign and the DNC, the Clinton's use of the Victory fund before the general election, etc. Wikileaks has already published the contract which validated everything she said on this. \n\nThere are many other things in the book which would be difficult / impossible to verify, and are obviously self-serving-- particularly how she paints herself as not wanting the interim chair role. She is exhaustive on this point and really overdoes it. I don't believe her. \n\nI do believe her on the point of Obama and DWS causing financial problems at the DNC-- Obama by ignoring it, and Debbie Wasserman-Schultz by having monthly expenditures at about 2X where they should have been. We already know that Obama thought the DNC was a bunch of incompetent idiots, so he pushed them to the side and ran everything through the white house and PACs.

'Perhaps the most hilariously sad part of the DACA response has been the (obviously coordinated and intentional) use of the word "cruel" to describe Trump\'s action. \n\nCruel, cruel, cruel. That word is in every tweet or post by any leftist pundit or organization who matters and has a platform. And, as intended and expected, it\'s being regurgitated by rank-and-file leftist parrots. \n\nThe hilarious part is that Trump\'s action on DACA was anything but cruel. Cruel would have been to take no action, let it go to the Supreme Court where it would get suddenly shot down, and send 800,000 dockers scrambling without warning. All Trump did was recognize the deferred, temporary aspect of the program, rescind it before the SCOTUS did, and set a reasonable deadline for Congress to make law on an issue that\'s their job anyway. It\'s impossible for a reasonable person to see any of that as cruel. Enforcing the law is not cruel; it\'s literally the job of the Executive Branch.\n\nWhich brings me to the sad part.... The sad part is that the coordinated use of the word "cruel" is designed to blatantly appeal to feelings (primarily the feelings of white women, if you want to crudely get identity political about it). To see what I mean, find Jen Hatmaker\'s page on Facebook and read her latest post about DACA. She\'s a fairly significant voice in the "white liberal Christian woman" movement, and her position on DACA reads like a Chuck Schumer press release. Guess what word is showcased near the beginning of her post...\n\nThe word "cruel" is being deliberately deployed as an unapologetic, embarrassing plea to pure emotion, encouraging big-hearted but weak-minded folks to suspend rational thinking in favor of making policy based on whether your feelings are hurt. It\'s literally the opposite of America (which is uniquely based on the Rule of Law, not majority rule based on what\'s "mean" or "kind").\n'
"The MSM ignores the fact that Trump has stated numerous times that he has sympathy for DACA recipients. His main motivation wasn't to hurt these kids and young adults, but to remove Obama's illegal amnesty program that should have went through Congress first... But of course the MSM ignores that."
"I'm a legal immigrant to the US, and I'm against DACA. It gives special treatment to illegal immigrants while legal immigrants get none. If it is going to be this way, what's the point of having the immigration system? What's the point of us following the law?\n\nYes, the illegal children did not knowingly committed the crime. They should not be punished for it. However, they also shouldn't by default get special treatment or citizenship.\n\nConsider this scenario. Two parents came to the US legally with their 7 year old child on a work visa. The child went to school here in the States. He grew up in the American culture, spoke fluent English, while barely able to speak his native language.\n\n8 years later, parents' work visa expires and can't be renewed. The family will all have to move back to their native country.\n\nThe child did not make the decision to move to the US. The child is no longer familiar with his native country. Even still, he will need to leave along with his parents.\n\nThey were here legally. They worked. They paid taxes. They submitted and updated their immigration paperwork as required. They didn't break any law (else their visas would have been revoked).\n\nIf a child of a legal alien can't automatically get special status while staying in the US for years, then I see no reason to grant such status to a child of an illegal alien."

How can an AG not realize that DACA is illegal so ending it cannot be illegal.  He should be ashamed of himself but it's WA so he's a hero."
"If the Supreme court strikes down DACA, which virtually all legal scholars agree will happen, then all the people affected by DACA would be deported immediately. The court required Trump had to make a decision to either defend DACA (which obviously he won't, because it is obviously unconstitutional and it isn't even his policy) or kill it.

'So let me get this straight. It appears People in the FBI colluded with Fusion GPS to get dirt on candidate Trump (fabricated dirt no less) because Fusion GPS employed the spouse of at least 1 FBI agent. Fusion GPS then offered dirt to Donald Trump Jr on HRC which Donald Trump Jr turned down because he said it wasn‚Äôt believable.  So Fusion GPS gets their ‚Äúdirt‚Äù on DJT to another FBI agent who then used the fabricated dirt to obtain a FISA warrant to investigate DJT.  This same FBI agent was the lead investigator on the HRC email criminal activity and the one who changed Comey‚Äôs wording in the written statement on HRC and encouraged no charges for HRC. This same agent (and the other agent whose spouse worked for Fusion GPS) were both ‚Äúselected‚Äù onto Mueller‚Äôs team to investigate DJT and Russian collusion. And the Judge presiding in the Michael Flynn case resulting from the DJT investigation was the same Judge that issued the FISA warrant based on the fabricated dirt on DJT - although the charges against Flynn were not colluding with Russia.  And on top of that McCabe, the #2 at the FBI, his spouse has received over $600,000.00 from HRC backed organizations. So now the Judge has to recuse himself, one agent has already been removed from Mueller‚Äôs team, and it would seem criminal prosecution would be forthcoming. Who in their right mind could argue that the FBI is not in tatters?  Democracy is dying at the hands of the FBI. The people in power better get this right or there will be Hell to pay. \n\nEdit:  how is this not the equivalent of planting evidence?  \n\nEdit2:  I might have said FBI agent when I should have set deputy attorney general.

'To me this just confirms the theory that Obama/Hillary and other Western nations helped create ISIS to help fight Assad and force a worker migration to Europe. \n\nIn 1945, [Earnest Hooton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnest_Hooton) published a plan to "Breed the war strain out of Europe" by importing a lot of male immigrants to breed with remaining German females. \n\nObama left half a billion dollars lying around in an poorly guarded bank for ISIS to find. All the criminals broke out of prison easily too. The ISIS leader Al-Baghdadi seems like he was made up and I\'ve only ever seen two pictures of him out of tons of articles. ISIS was allowed to recruit on Twitter, and intel agencies certainly must have known who was in contact with them and who was traveling there, so why not stop them? Also, remember Obama\'s dumb "save the environment" excuse for not bombing ISIS oilfields; certainly he wanted them to have financing and I bet a share of the ISIS oil cash went to the dudes who were recently arrested in Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhat they did was create a battlefront to draw out all the jihadis in the world, keep them in the Middle East fighting over stuff while being directed by western agents posing as jihadis, while the nonviolent  workers fled to Europe to "breed the war strain out of them". Now that Trump\'s put a stop to ISIS the spies and directors are returning to reintegrate and collect their bonuses.'

"Spread the word, pedes:\n\n> Samuel Francis argued that the problems of managerial state extend to issues of crime and justice. In 1992, he introduced the word ‚Äúanarcho-tyranny‚Äù into the paleocon vocabulary.[10] He once defined it this way: ‚Äúwe refuse to control real criminals (that's the anarchy) so we control the innocent (that's the tyranny).‚Äù[11] Francis argued that this situation extends across the U.S. and Europe. While the government functions normally, violent crime remains a constant, creating a climate of fear (anarchy). He says that ‚Äúlaws that are supposed to protect ordinary citizens against ordinary criminals‚Äù routinely go unenforced, even though the state is ‚Äúperfectly capable‚Äù of doing so. While this problem rages on, government elites concentrate their interests on law-abiding citizens."

She badmouthed Trump in the primaries and wouldn\'t vote for him which really soured me on her; however, I read somewhere that she tried to talk Jeb! out of running because she thought there\'d been quite enough Bushes in the White House and she didn\'t think he had any chance of winning, anyway.\n\nBut, the fact that Barbara Bush had no interest in MAGA was no surprise to me.  I remember the first time I ever heard of "The New World Order" was from her POS husband during a speech while he was still president.  He slipped it in so casually with no preface or explanation, that I actually had to look it up.  Turns out, HW\'s father, Prescott Bush, was one of the founders of globalism.\n\nI have a thing against speaking ill of the dead because they can no longer defend themselves against calumnies.

'[News source](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-aids-felony-20170315-story.html).\n\nEdit: [Info on when the bill passed](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB239).\n\nFrom the bill: "Existing law makes it a felony punishable by imprisonment for 3, 5, or 8 years in the state prison to expose another person to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by engaging in unprotected sexual activity when the infected person knows at the time of the unprotected sex that he or she is infected with HIV, has not disclosed his or her HIV-positive status, and acts with the specific intent to infect the other person with HIV.  \nExisting law makes it a felony punishable by imprisonment for 2, 4, or 6 years for any person to donate blood, tissue, or, under specified circumstances, semen or breast milk, if the person knows that he or she has acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), or that he or she has tested reactive to HIV.\n\n\n**This bill would repeal those provisions. The bill would instead make the intentional transmission of an infectious or communicable disease, as defined, a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than 6 months.**"\n\nSix months for intentionally infecting someone with HIV. These sick fucks.  '
'Cucks. All of these communist faggots arr cucks. '
'The Left are into biological warfare, they throw shit and piss at people who support free speech, they elect officials who engage in flesh-eating ceremonies and perform menstrual blood and semen "art." I\'m sure he has no ulterior motive for this bullshit, and if you disagree with him, you\'re a homophobe!\n'
'Holy shit every day I think there is a limit to the stupidity, then I remember they are thinking emotionally to which the limit is only barred by their own imagination.'
"This is one of the most evil things I've seen from any Senator.\n\nAlso, way to go Cuckifornia. Way to reaffirm the stereotype."
'Maybe we should stop electing people named Weiner until we can figure out what the hell is going on. A complete and total Weiner ban.'
'fuck that shit'
"**FUCK SCOTT WEINER!**\n\nMake these degenerates who spread AIDS without informing them before sex reguster as sex offenders. \n\nIf there has to be a sex offender registry which I'm hesitant about because it's easy to get wrongfully convicted of sex crimes anyway, the **ONLY** offenses I support the registry for is forcible rape, intentionally falsely accusing someone of rape, **not telling someone that you have HIV before sex**, and child molestation. \n\nWe need to get a challenger against this weasel next time."
'this is one of the biggest lawmaking missteps in years. \n\nit is now legal to condemn someone to long painful suffering and death because you wanted to get some D or get your dick wet. \n\nFucking disgusting. '
'Holy shit this is legal in my state now?????\n\n#THATS IT EAST CA (+ San Diego and Orange county) MUST SECEDE NOW'
'This is seriously disturbing.  If you have a life threatening and incurable disease that can be passed to someone else, you should be obligated to tell them unless you\'re a sociopath.\n\nThis is fucking insane.  I am SO glad I moved out of California.  That place was dangerous enough before this law passed.  Now I would not fuck anyone in California because they could lie to me and give me HIV without facing any repercussions.  \n\nPretty soon they\'ll pass laws protecting "rape victims" from being prosecuted if they lie and ruin someone\'s life.  Sick state.'
'This is how you get citizens to kill other citizens because the law has failed them. I bet this guy made millions lobbying for this anti-west law. More stuff to break down America'
'SO WHICH IS IT???\n\n"HIV is not a gay disease"\n\n"Laws that make it illegal to have  sex with somebody without telling them your HIV status are homophobic"'
'If anything, this law is Homophobic because more gay people will end up dead from AIDS or complications from having little to no immune system in place.  \n\nThis is not a misdemeanor, peoples lives can be ruined emotionally, financially and physically because of lying about a disease that destroys your immune system.\n\nThis bill better not pass, because many people still think lying about having a very dangerous, life altering disease is attempted murder.\n\nEdit:its an [enrolled bill - The final copy of a bill or joint resolution which has passed both chambers in identical form. It is printed on parchment paper, signed by appropriate House and Senate officials, and submitted to the president for signature](https://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/enrolled_bill.htm)\n\nSo from what I understand, it still needs to be signed by presiding officers of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, as well as the president.\n\nalso, the president can still veto it.\n\nEdit 2: unless the law is just for California ... which I have no idea if the president has any say in it, due to it being state government instead of the federal one.'

"Make no mistake, this is an attack on straight white people. Men who have sex with men and black people make up the overwhelming majority of hiv cases. They're trying to spread it to the rest of us"
'I think if you are HIV positive and lie to your partner about your HIV status, you should be charged with a crime. It is NOT homophobic. Intentionally giving someone a life-altering virus is evil and should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. '

Then they might not fuck me."'
'Not just sex.\nSB239 would reduce the penalty for lying about your status when donating blood and semen.\n\nWhy would you lie?  And why are you donating?!'

"Islam is the greatest killer of all time, worse than Christianity, fascism or communism. Islamic jihad destroyed a Christian Middle East and a Christian North Africa. Soon it was the fate of the Persian Zoroastrian and the Hindu to be the victims of jihad. The history of political Islam is the destruction of Christianity in the Middle East, Egypt, Turkey and North Africa. Half of Christianity was lost. Before Islam, North Africa was the southern part of Europe (part of the Roman Empire). Around 60 million Christians were slaughtered during the jihadic conquest. Half of the glorious Hindu civilization was annihilated and 80 million Hindus killed. The first Western Buddhists were the Greeks descended from Alexander the Great's army in what is now Afghanistan. Jihad destroyed all of Buddhism along the silk route. About 10 million Buddhists died. The conquest of Buddhism is the practical result of pacifism. Zoroastrianism was eliminated from Persia. The Jews became permanent dhimmis throughout Islam. In Africa over 120 million Christians and animists have died over the last 1400 years of jihad. Approximately 270 million nonbelievers died over the last 1400 years for the glory of political Islam. These are the Tears of Jihad which are not taught in any school.\n\n\nThese figures are a rough estimate of the death of non-Muslims by the political act of jihad.\n\n\nAfrica\n\n\nThomas Sowell [Thomas Sowell, Race and Culture, BasicBooks, 1994, p. 188] estimates that 11 million slaves were shipped across the Atlantic and 14 million were sent to the Islamic nations of North Africa and the Middle East. For every slave captured many others died. Estimates of this collateral damage vary. The renowned missionary David Livingstone estimated that for every slave who reached a plantation, five others were killed in the initial raid or died of illness and privation on the forced march.[Woman‚Äôs Presbyterian Board of Missions, David Livingstone, p. 62, 1888] Those who were left behind were the very young, the weak, the sick and the old. These soon died since the main providers had been killed or enslaved. So, for 25 million slaves delivered to the market, we have an estimated death of about 120 million people. Islam ran the wholesale slave trade in Africa.\n\n\n120 million Africans\n\n\nChristians\n\n\nThe number of Christians martyred by Islam is 9 million [David B. Barrett, Todd M. Johnson, World Christian Trends AD 30-AD 2200, William Carey Library, 2001, p. 230, table 4-10] . A rough estimate by Raphael Moore in History of Asia Minor is that another 50 million died in wars by jihad. So counting the million African Christians killed in the 20th century we have:\n\n\n60 million Christians\n\n\nHindus\n\n\nKoenard Elst in Negationism in India gives an estimate of 80 million Hindus killed in the total jihad against India. [Koenard Elst, Negationism in India, Voice of India, New Delhi, 2002, pg. 34.] The country of India today is only half the size of ancient India, due to jihad. The mountains near India are called the Hindu Kush, meaning the ‚Äúfuneral pyre of the Hindus.‚Äù\n\n\n80 million Hindus\n\n\nBuddhists\n\n\nBuddhists do not keep up with the history of war. Keep in mind that in jihad only Christians and Jews were allowed to survive as dhimmis (servants to Islam) everyone else had to convert or die. Jihad killed the Buddhists in Turkey, Afghanistan, along the Silk Route, and in India. The total is roughly 10 million. [David B. Barrett, Todd M. Johnson, World Christian Trends AD 30-AD 2200, William Carey Library, 2001, p. 230, table 4-1.]\n\n\n10 million Buddhists\n\n\nJews\n\n\nOddly enough there were not enough Jews killed in jihad to significantly affect the totals of the Great Annihilation. The jihad in Arabia was 100 percent effective, but the numbers were in the thousands, not millions. After that, the Jews submitted and became the dhimmis (servants and second class citizens) of Islam and did not have geographic political power.\n\n\nThis gives a rough estimate of 270 million killed by jihad. The real history of the Crusades, a just response to over 350 years of genocidal Islamic Jihad:\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-uFKpVqq4w\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmgMEu_9n1s\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfxzFELB8To\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oSIQRF_AHM&list=PL-AzW58MV80EhvGtCwpYHK-N7C1XKm0Eq&index=3\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz1V3D-uOok&index=4&list=PL-AzW58MV80EhvGtCwpYHK-N7C1XKm0Eq\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubhIXY2WExk\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttKoHgOWMTk\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_Qpy0mXg8Y\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMwcX_vU1lM\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Br9fS9PXs4\n"

"This is what Open-Borders gets you!  \n\nEver wonder how CA got so fucked?  [I present to you:  Proposition 187.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_187).  I was a Freshman at college in 94 and vividly remember the heated debate.  Prop 187 would've made it illegal for illegal aliens to receive government benefits including, healthcare, welfare and public education.  The economic/social impacts of what at the time was a wave of illegals pouring into CA was already driving down wages and increasing everyone's taxes and changing the culture of our communities (including TONS of Mexican gangs/crime).  \n\nThe response of the Left at the time was to scream racism and discrimination.  Want to know where the modern day Dems got their playbook to defeat any measure to quell illegal immigration?  REMEMBER PROP 187.  \n\nBefore 187, whites were the majority in CA.  After 187 was overturned, it opened the floodgates to millions of illegal aliens to pour into our country ... no consequences ... full benefits.   25 years later, whites are a minority and Mexicans are a majority in CA.  Massive culture shift.  Mexican gangs running our prisons and crime on the streets.  Illegals taking jobs, lowering wages and sponging off the government.  \n\nBiggest turning point of all?  CA will never vote Republican again.  All those illegals eventually were granted Driver's Licenses and can now easily vote.  As a result, Dems will forever more own CA and all its electoral votes.  We now are a Sanctuary State in which deporting illegals and cooperating with ICE is fucking ILLEGAL.  \n\nI've seen this downfall of my beloved CA with my own eyes and it's fucking heartbreaking.

"After hundreds of years of moslims attempting to conquer Europe, Europeans fighting back for their families, communities, and God, the moslims are 'graciously' allowed in by 'altruism' and 'tolerance'. \nThis is just sad and I don't see any positive solution in the future besides some sort of civil war. \nThe thought of moslims destroying European relics, shrines, and historical landmarks to rewrite history as they tend to do is sickening. \nThe world is a better place for Europe's ingenuity and bravery, and this is how we thank our accomplished forbears...."
'There\'s one religion called islam with over 1.6 billion followers who claim to worship the same God as Christians and Jews...except their holy book claims that this same God desires, requires, and fully expects them to murder all the Christians and Jews. It further expects them to rule the entire planet, which the book states is the province of islam. Their culture also allows for the torture and murder of homosexuals and women, and the genital mutilation of young girls.\n\nI\'m like, WTF?\n\nLiberals be like, "Cool! BRING "EM IN!"'
'And in the US it\'s our "latino" population doing the same thing. Every white nation is basically fucked at this point. It\'ll take another 20-30 years before whites wake up. In the future when most of our elected officials are brown and whites are being discriminated against openly, and not just little quips on internet articles, that there will be war. When that does happen, we are so vastly out numbered I have very little faith in not being decimated. We have to look at eastern EU like Poland and Ukraine and hope they can keep them out. Russians need to stop their government from trying to destroy Ukraine non stop though. '

"The last important thing that has happened in Europe in the past 100 years is two world wars. Two waves of socialism and one of fascism. They could barely repress communism (half the continent didn't) and absolutely wouldn't if it wasn't for the marshal plan. It's  a bunch of third world countries that have had their policies dictated by foreign powers for almost a century now. There is hardly any sovereignty of state there."

'We wont make it to 2050 without war. Immigration to germany "as is" will continue for at least another 4 years, means moslem will be the mayority in fighting age men. \n\nIt will not be a closed front against natives, but local warlords in their own ethnically divided suburbs. Todays "nogo zones" are tansforming into exterritorial muslim enclaves. The only thing preventing "dropping the mask" are welfare payments. If the state cuts moslem welfare we will have insta-war.\n\nI wonder how todays lefties will react confronted with ransacking moslem hordes. Some will lube up their asses, but some might fight. How many panzerkampfwagen are hidden in german barns, and can old men still fight?\n\nIf we survive we will throw the moslems back over the bosporus, we will cleanse the continent of any moslem presence. I trust Trump to stay neutral, or even help us. Dont do what "clinton the rapist" did in kosovo, stab christians in the back and help moselms. '

'I went to this school. I had to take a gender studies class to fulfill those GE bullshit they are talking about. Gender studies professor told me every single male is gay because we can tell what an attractive male should look like, and try to mimic it. She told me they proved all men are gay, because """scientists""" wrapped a string around a man\'s dick and forced him to watch gay porn. The circumference of the string increased so that proves he had an erection and thus he enjoyed gay porn. Because us straights, when we see gay porn we are secretly aroused but only get a chubby and immediately hide it. \n\nIn an essay for that class, I wrote that the family unit crystalized human beings into structures of support that helped us throughout the eons. I received an F on that essay because fragments of a crystal that can\'t fit into the grid get rejected by the crystalline structure and it was evident of my natural hate for queers and lesbians. The most ironic part is that fragments not in a crystalline structure don\'t get rejected, they just form a separate crystalline structure from other floating fragments. She just didn\'t have any understanding of basic chemistry from 3rd grade but had the nerve to assert her knowledge of hormone changes in a man with a string wrapped around his dick being forced to watch gay porn. \n\nI had to take an ethnic studies class too. The class was basically like any normal literature class, except every book we read was from a black male. That was the whole point of the class. As a project, we had to go to a religious institution that would be from outside our own culture. I asked if I could go to a Mosque or a Jewish temple, and she said no, it had to be a Baptist church known to have predominately black members. Ironically, this professor told a story about how she travelled to Afghanistan in the 70\'s before the Soviets invaded. She smoked hashish with a group of men, but she had to leave pretty quickly after that because she stated she was afraid of being raped. "You know, stoned Muslim men, pretty little blonde girl with blue eyes, it could have gotten ugly".\n\nBy the way, I went into that school a very liberal young child, and I left that school a grown up conservative. Marxist shit had the profound opposite effect on me you bastards. '

'So he thinks Seth Rich leaked the docs but believes his murder is not connected because he lived in a bad neighborhood that had several robberies with a gun recently and that he fought off the robber because of his scuffed hands and at that point the robber fled after shooting two bullets into the back of his head.'
"Wheeler states that on several occasions Seth's brother, Aaron, cautioned Wheeler not to talk about the leaked DNC emails. The Hersh audio reveals that Seth had given several others access to the files, as insurance (If something happens to me, your problem isn't solved). If Aaron was one of Seth's  insurance backups, it could explain the Rich family's efforts to shut down the investigation. There is potential criminal liability, as well as fear of deep state reprisal."
'[Seymour Hersh questioning the Russia hacking narrative:](https://theintercept.com/2017/01/25/seymour-hersh-blasts-media-for-uncritically-promoting-russian-hacking-story/)\n\n>Hersh denounced news organizations as ‚Äúcrazy town‚Äù for their uncritical promotion of the pronouncements of the director of national intelligence and the CIA, given their track records of lying and misleading the public.\n\n>‚ÄúThe way they behaved on the Russia stuff was outrageous,‚Äù Hersh said when I sat down with him at his home in Washington, D.C., two days after Trump was inaugurated. **‚ÄúThey were just so willing to believe stuff. And when the heads of intelligence give them that summary of the allegations, instead of attacking the CIA for doing that, which is what I would have done,‚Äù** they reported it as fact.

Top to bottom.\n\nAlso, it\'s astonishing that innocent men have served years for false rape accusations. Well educated college students have had their names dragged through the mud for trying to get a piece of ass at a campus party when both inviduals were drunk, countless examples of innocent men being preyed upon by a liberal court system who pretends to care about womens safety and over-zealously prosecute. Don\'t get me wrong... womens safety is extremely important, and any REAL rape accusation is inexcusable.... which makes my point that much more infuriating.\n\nThe most powerful man in liberal, pedophile ridden, sexual deviant ridden, secret society loving hollywood, who may just be the worst rapist of all time if you really think about it. This man gets to walk free and have the system run blocks for him. What a fucking joke.\n\nThis serial rapist fat fucking disgusting piece of shit has paraded around and raped women because of this bubble he\'s existed inside with a stacked deck. Countless women.... and not just any women, some of the most prominent women of the last 2 decades... this disgusting corpulent monster has been raping 10\'s at his leisure and acting like it\'s daily routine.\n\nThis guy is one of the largest criminals of the last 20 years. I can\'t think of a worse abuse of power and worse schematic that someone has drawn up. This guy literally set up his life to be a bought and paid for rapefest that he could never get in trouble for and lived a life outside of that which was the most lavish.\n\nProsecute this god damned fucking porky pig.

'> I‚Äôve had a disease but I have no excuse\n\n> In admitting this, Mr. Weiner captured an important distinction that has been lost in our culture, which tends to over-pathologize problematic behavior. He didn‚Äôt blame his ‚Äúdisease.‚Äù\n\nThe mere fact that he calls this a "disease" is blaming the "disease." What a load of shit.'
"Do not hesitate to get in their faces when they try this shit. We all tend to be kind and try to see the other person's point of view so we listen and try to see where we might be wrong.

'>In admitting this, Mr. Weiner captured an important distinction that has been lost in our culture, which tends to over-pathologize problematic behavior. He didn‚Äôt blame his ‚Äúdisease.‚Äù He knows that there is a difference between having a compulsion and acting on it. But there is an idea bigger than just controlling one‚Äôs impulses.

"The entire article rambles on about other unrelated things, then the last paragraph gets to the point:  \n  \n> This may sound odd, but I admire Anthony Weiner for what he did on Monday. He stood tearfully before the judge and acknowledged several compatible truths: that he was responsible for his action, that he is accepting the consequences, and that he needs help so that he can liberate himself from those compulsions, or, at the very least, stop acting on them.  \n  \nNo one should admire this fucker. If they are going to write an article about him, it should be about what a little fucker he is and how bad of a person he is.

'I have to admit, the Left proved me wrong on this. Illegal immigrants do jobs I don‚Äôt want to do; such as murder, fraud, money laundering, drug trafficking, and drug possession'
'100% of illegal immigrants have broken at least one law. \n'
'That [talking point](http://archive.is/MUw7r) is a perfect example of liberals putting their feelings above facts and logic. \n\nIgnoring the feelings, we\'re talking about a population of people where 100 percent of them are knowingly breaking a law in the process of coming here. Obviously that alone will make that group statistically more likely to break other laws. \n\nWe\'re also talking about a population that is disproportionately young and male, and basically 100 percent are poor, and all of that is correlated with higher crime rates. \n\nOn top of that, the countries they\'re coming from are countries that have vastly higher murder rates. \n\nhttps://immigration.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000845\n\nThe most common countries of origin for US illegal immigrants are. \n\n1.  Mexico\n\n2. El Salvador\n\n3. Guatemala\n\n4. Philippines\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate\n\nThe US murder rate is  4.88 (per 100k). \n\n1.  Mexico - 16.35, over three times higher than ours\n\n2. El Salvador - 108.64, 22 times higher than ours. El Salvador has literally the highest murder rate in the entire world.\n\n3. Guatemala - 31.21, over six times higher than ours\n\n4. Philippines - 9.84, more than twice as high as ours\n\nAnd for the liberals who say, "well these people are leaving those crime ridden countries to escape." Yeah, and they\'re still born and raised in countries with vastly higher murder rates, particularly in the poorest areas of those countries. Obviously that\'s going to make them statistically more prone to violent crime, regardless of whether or not they tend to like the area they grew up in. \n\nAnd of course, liberals will also argue, "well they\'re going to be committing less crime because they\'re afraid of getting deported." Sorry no, deportation is not a larger deterrent than a long prison sentence is.'
'#SOMEBODY‚ÄôS DOING THE RAPING'
'Criminal privilege. Liberals turned America into a Disneyland for Central and South American criminals. They have absolutely no motivation to stay in their native countries and rape, rob, murder, and move drugs. There are plenty of motivations for them to set up shop in the United States, and 10 million + have done so.\n\nWe have become a nation divided politically. The base of the division is the law. We respect and obey the law. We know it is the social contract that protects the rights of all, and prevents a descent into anarchy. Liberals don\'t respect our laws. They may act smug and enlightened, but this is a cover for their contempt of our laws. They don\'t respect or obey the law. They want crime to pay. They want those that go around the law to rule over the "suckers" that obey the law. Whether or not our laws matter, whether or not they apply to everyone is the whole basis for all the division in the country. HRC is everything the criminals want in a President, while **President Trump** with his "I will be the law and order President" is their worst nightmare.\n\nIts time to take a stand. Just like in the old westerns. The nice peaceful town of farmers and shopkeepers is under threat from the violent criminal gang that seeks  take over and destroy what they have built. The criminals have brought in a Mexican gang to help them terrorize the townspeople.\n\nWe only win if we stand with the new Marshall that has ridden in to help us. They know this, and that is why they are always trying to get us to abandon him. Stand fast. Stand for **President Trump**, stand for law and order, stand for **America**.'
'He fails to mention 100% of them commit a crime but entering illegally. They are all literally criminals. Every single one.'
"It's good the data is being collected again. CA stopped making the distinction between illegal and legal immigrants in their crime/prison data around a decade ago. It was done for two reasons. Obviously to hide the real amount of crime and also push the view that an immigrant is an immigrant, there is no such an illegal immigration. Pushing their political agenda was more important than the safety of the people living in the state."
"Holy shit that's close to 4000 murders. "
'7% of the population? That is a massive amount of illegal aliens. How are that many aliens still here? It‚Äôs as if we are intentionally letting them cross the border and stay...\n\n\nOh wait.'
'This just prove once and for all why you need a border wall. NO ONE can deny it any longer!!!'
'Fun Fact: 100% of illegal immigrants are criminals. Think about it.'
'So without blacks and illegals, what would the actual violent crime rate in the US be?'
'7% of our population is illegal and they account for 22% of all federally convicted murders.  \n\nThe black demographic make up roughly 12% of our population, and so roughly 6% black men and 6% black women.  Black men account for roughly 50% of murders in our country (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_crime_in_the_United_States#Incarceration_by_race_and_ethnicity)\n\nBy this math, 13% of our population accounts for about 72% of our murders, though this is admittedly probably a little off since the first stat is for federal cases, and the second is for federal and state.   '
'The big takeaway for me here was that 7% of our population are illegals. WTF America!'
'I live in Denver, and this is something we know here very well. I, and every person I know has been a victim of crimes by illegal immigrants. They steal, rape and kill every day here. I know three people who have lost family members to drunk driving illegal immigrants. Our politicians here (Corey Gardener) have sold us out in hopes of replacing us with Mexican immigrants who will vote for free hand outs.'
'>They sacrifice for their families in ways you probably don‚Äôt.\n\n\nThat line always pisses me off. Because it‚Äôs complete and total bullshit. Just because I won‚Äôt enter a country illegally, and break multiple laws of that country for my family, doesn‚Äôt mean I care, or sacrifice any less for them. I work too. \n\n\nAnd it‚Äôs not that Americans wouldn‚Äôt do those ‚Äúbad jobs‚Äù either. It‚Äôs just that we demand a fair wage. And we aren‚Äôt stupid, or desperate enough, to be taken advantage of by some shady business owners.\n\n\nAlso, money transfers to any foreign country (Mexico, South America, etc.) should be taxed at 75% unless you can prove you paid the appropriate taxes on it.'

"It's not like they wanted to stay in Hungary.\n\nSome refugees were actually briefly located in Poland, about 60 of them. Privately located there on a group sponsorship. It took them less than  a month for all 60 of them to run over into Germany.\n\nWhy? Because Poland, Hungary, Czechia, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria do not have gibsmedats, they have social programs like what Trump wants, which is to focus only on citizens and not give welfare to immigrants, also not give out welfare to completely healthy working age people that just aren't working because they're lazy. Refugees were also located in Czechia and Slovakia, and they all ran over into Germany because Germany gives out gibsmedats like candy. The refugee camps in those countries are completely empty now.\n\nAnyway, my point was that they heard the border was being finished, so they all ran over quickly so they could get further west into Germany. From there, they can also move on to other gibsmedats countries like Denmark, Sweden, France, or the UK."
"Liberals and Western Europeans are literally stunk-masochists who want to spread their self hatred onto other Whites/Europeans.  It's despicable. They would rather open their borders and get raped than build a wall and deport the illegals"

He just looked down and jingled his bell, and when she walked away I just gave him the rest of my cash and said Merry Christmas. \n\nIt's not even completely about the holiday, it's also about the Spirit it's supposed to bring to people.

"The misguided realized that similes, metaphors and analogies have to make sense to be accepted. What happened instead is, the conglomerate of liberal powers started redefining words themselves. Man, woman, immigrant, sexist, fact, fiction, right, wrong etc. Then they went on to make up their own rules. White people are inherently racist, beyond all realities. Blacks cannot ever be racist. A woman's shortcoming is mans' oppression, and a man's success is privilege. Illegal aliens is an insult, classifying an individual as subhuman, and citizenship is an unalienable right so long as Donald Trump fights illegal alienship.\n\nFacts are slowly being determined by measure of character, rather than merit. A deemed racist can't tell the truth, and transgendered persons cant be wrong. Men cant be victims, and women cant be oppressors. \n\nOf course its so, that the demographics demonized by the liberal media are the demographics that compose the bulk of republicans: white men. I wonder if this is due to white men being demonized, or if theyre demonized because they lean Republican. "

There are literally millions of us, and if illegal voting is cracked down on, it will be a complete landslide.\n\nThere are currently liberals on my facebook that I made the mistake of pointing out Trump is helping California and Puerto Rico.  But they cried and REEEE'd that he was being mean and it didn't matter.  My vote and anyone reading that thread has been cemented for 2020.\n\nTrump supporters don't start bullshit.  They're sick of dealing with it and work to clean it up without fanfare or virtue signalling, unlike liberals, which only do something if it gets them attention."
'These total absolute assholes with their "Not my President" horseshit last November and December... Fucking cereal companies putting this shit out in tweets.

"Politically spun Polls from polling groups/companies are done to force the attention AWAY from the real polling which you show.\n\nMost people don't bother with polling calls. they hang up because they know they're all BS or likely will be spun to get the results that are wanted. Or they may completely bullshit the poll just to skew the results for fun.\n\nBut the REAL indicators of the public are real life consumerism. What are people doing out there in the real world (or not doing). And this is what is scaring the living hell out of liberals/democrats right now. There is no way to hide the fact that people are not supporting the liberal agenda anymore with their wallets and TVs."

"Liberalism is AIDS. \n\nYou're enthusiastic in the moment when you suddenly contract HIV. You don't notice the symptoms at first as all systems appear to be normal. Slowly as the disease gains more power it turns into full blown AIDS. The disease has grown far too much for you to successfully combat in your daily life. Eventually you lose your ability to go about your life. Major systems begin shutting down and other commonly avoidable problems become suddenly life threatening. Problems such as crippling debt, gang violence, collapse of the nuclear family, abortion genocide, etc. all cripple the society. \n\nLiberalism is never the direct reason for death, but it is the root cause that enabled the ultimately avoidable death blow. "
'I\'ve heard comparison by Milo (or perhaps another fellow spicy speaker) that Liberalism is AIDS too :DDD\n\nIt\'s a disease that cause you to lose immunity and all ability to prevent harm to yourself. Your mind and thought process no longer rejects when bull---- comes at you, then you took all those foreign elements "liberally" hook and sinkers. \n\nFrom what I see on the posts these few days you can see their obvious failure of judgement to prevent self-harm on their personal level, like wearing pussy hats, make death threats to the President on Twitter, and at worst levels that numerous examples of people that licked toilets in the name of #resisttrump and posted their most shameful moments of their life as bragging rights.

It\'s not privilege that\'s a problem, it\'s just anti-white racism.\n\n2.) It\'s Jews leading the circus. They call themselves white talking about how "fellow whites" should do this or that until they\'re told to do something themselves, then they fall back and reveal their Jewish heritage.

But when an Islamic sympathizer comes out and *almost weekly now*, and kills dozens of people, the world shouts, *#notallmuslims* and offers pure condolences on a wide scale to every person of the Islamic faith with no backtrack.

She knows that she\'s so ugly and disgusting that nobody wants to even think about fucking her.

Not to recover, get back into having a normal life and then potentially "steal" the man that the fat slob was eyeing.\n \nThat\'s why they also support the bathroom policy, they want young girls and women to get assaulted by pervert men so then they can start hating on men.

The Uzbek national suspected of the Swedish lorry attack had expressed sympathy for the group.\n\nAccording to western intelligence officials, Islamist propaganda has switched its tactics, from calling on people to travel to Syria to join a self-declared caliphate, to urging them to carry out attacks in the countries where they live.\n\nThis comparison made by CNN is absolutely ridiculous and frankly disgusting...  when you have Islamic terrorists/sympathizers over the last few years utilizing vehicles on multiple different occasions to kill multiple people, in one case over 80!  And you say this islamic terrorist attack is comparable to a vehicular attack that happened barely a week ago!  Absolutely abhorrent  I cannot believe the liberal media‚Ä¶ They\'ve gone completely off the deep end! I would not be surprised if behind closed doors they are furious that this happened, as it takes attention away from the Charlottesville "White supremacists" narrative they have been pushing so hard. I mean look at what Podesta said in his emails it\'s better if a white guy commits a attack rather than a Muslim!'

"I fully believe there was 2 separate shooters.  Kennedy was dead before the headshot.  In the modern stabilized video, you can see him reach up toward his chest area and kind of freezes, it kind of looks like a strong sneeze but his arm movements are really unnatural and his arms look locked. Then he slumps forward a little and stops moving entirely.  He was likely struck in the heart.  Then a few second later, the head shot comes in.   \n\nAnd given the almost invisible nature of the first shot, it's likely the bullet was not of the same caliber, because if it was, it would have been apparent he was shot because it would have splattered everywhere.  So it's clear a much smaller bullet was fired first, to shoot him in the chest, then a second shooter shoots him in the head with a high caliber to make sure he's finished and to make it a very public display.    \n\nIt would make sense too, because the chest shot would immobilize him enough to make sure a headshot lands, because you don't want your target turning their head in the last moment and barely missing them, and if the chest shot isn't perfect, he could still have survived.  So it was a one two punch.  Step 1.  Shoot in chest to immobilize.  Step 2.  Shoot in head to finish him.   \n\nIt was a high level professional assassination, not just some random loner. I mean not only do you have to deal with range, you have to deal with a relatively fast moving target, along with knowing the path the vehicle planned to take without obstruction to get the cleanest shot.   Even the best snipers would find it difficult to get that shot against a stationary target, let alone one in a moving vehicle....and even professional snipers often work in teams of at least 2 people per weapon.  In the background, one is doing spotting for things like range and wind calculations and any other issues that might crop up like an upcoming obstruction.  "

What makes the Highland Clearnces inherently more evil is the fact that these **Scottish U.K. aristocrats were preying upon their own extended family relatives of their clan**. \n\nThat is why there are so many ornery Scotts in America, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.

So what there saying is is that blacks are incompetent to get jobs, etc.... Interesting that they call us white supremacists, and based on what the say on this matter is racist in its self! The hypocrisy of the left can really get to me sometimes.'
'I\'m really against this for several reasons.\n\n1. Remember, this isn\'t a direct democracy, the State Electoral College votes for the President.  Therefore the way the electoral college picks who they will vote for is completely up to the state.  If the state wants to go all Commie bastard and not even allow the citizen to cast a vote,  they can.   Article II Section 1 doesn\'t specify how the Electors shall be chosen in each state.  Sadly, a state apparently can even allow a non-citizen to vote.. Just not be an Elector.  Only the House of representatives is stated as being Directly elected by the people of the states. in Article 1 Section 2.  But again its the people of the state picking their representative, so its not a "Federal Election" and only the person being picked to be the representative is specified as having to be a US Citizen.\n\n2. The federal government is already overreaching greatly with the "Real ID" act which is forcing standards on state DLs.  They are forcing it by abusing their power and not allowing (starting next year) the citizens of states with non compliant DLs through the TSA checkpoints at airports.. Thus.. No flying.  You can\'t even get a fishing license in some states without a "Real ID" compliant ID now.. Yes, my Arizona DL got denied a fishing license in Colorado because it says "Not for Federal ID"... WTF...\n\n3. We already have a federal ID, its called a passport.\n\nReally, the US just needs to control the amount of Non citizens in the country at a time in order to ensure a state like California doesn\'t allow millions of non-citizens to sway the Electors of California to vote for a scumbag.  They can\'t stop California from allowing them to vote, but they can control how many are in California.'
"Democrats oppose voter-ID, because they can no longer effectively rig elections.\nBut they will say it is because it discriminates against minorities.\nMake them explain why! They will say it's raycis. How is it raycis?!\nThat is not a position they can defend without being extremely offensive.\nIf they say blacks and latinos are on average too stupid to get voter ID that will only hurt them!"
'Easy, bc they would lose a substantial amount of their illegal votes and would never win an election ever again'
'The best way to win an argument with a liberal cuck on this subject is as follows: ask them *‚Äùdo you think Canada, Mexico, Ireland, or Sweden are racist countries? (to which they will say ‚Äòno‚Äô).......well they have voter ID laws, why is America racist if they follow their voting policies as well?‚Äù* ü§î\n\n\nThey will have no real answer.'
'#MUH RACIST '
"bc they are too busy being racist and insisting that voter id laws are racist to black people because black people apparently don't know how to go to the DMV, or carry identification, or what have you."
'Nice try racist, don‚Äôt you know black people are too dumb to get an ID? Haha bet u feel stupid now racist! '
'This is pre-civil war stupidity. '
"Mexico is corrupt AF and showcasing their required voter ID is a bad example. In Mexico's case  it's not the voting that counts, it's the counting that counts. I'm not saying we shouldn't have voter IDs, we absolutely should, but in order to get Dems on board, we need to get more negative examples of what not having voter ID laws have on our democracy, i.e more on dead people voting or more veritas undercover vids during the 2018 elections."
"I don't support the idea of any federal ID.\nEvery State already has their own ID cards. Anything further would be a waste of tax money. We just need to enforce laws that we already have and crack down on voter fraud. I understand that a federal ID could make it easier, but at the same time it would add just that much more bureaucratic crap that could be abused and then States would have no control over how it was run. Who would oversee it? Any new government positions just add more possibility for corruption."
'In cali all you have to do is claim to be somebody and you can vote\n\nHow fucked up is that?'
"The leftist justification is that minorities are all poor, stupid, and disadvantaged.  They'll lose the ID more frequently or forget to bring it to the polling station or they won't have time and money to get a new replacement.\n\nWe should be voting on a blockchain or something.  Voter ID would have been an idea worth considering 40 years ago.  But even voter ID has problems that are solved by doing this stuff via a distributed ledger."
'Because how would the ID‚Äôs be issued? Mail? Okay what if you‚Äôre homeless, on a week to week rent, or living with family or friends? What documents would you have to provide to obtain the Id? Where would you go to present the documents? When could you go to preset them? The issue with ID laws is not the idea of providing an ID to vote. It is that, as we‚Äôve seen in Alabama and North Carolina, the states themselves make obtaining the ID nearly impossible by setting arbitrary and limited times and places to obtaining them, and require onerous documentation to acquire them. Further, the type of fraud that voter ids would battle is nearly non-existant.'

"The fact they reopened it after he joined the Trump campaign looks really bad for the FBI. They can't spy on campaigns.  If the Republicans wanted to be assholes they could investigate this. "

'She‚Äôs propping up the Russian hacking lie and trying to tie them to Seth‚Äôs murder. That in itself is a Seth Rich murder conspiracy that conflicts with the police ‚Äúbotched robbery‚Äù narrative. So she‚Äôs admitting Seth was killed for political reasons. That‚Äôs huge. \n\nBut if the Russians hacked the DNC why would they need to kill Seth? If Seth was just a lowly data analyst it‚Äôs unlikely he would have uncovered the Russian hacking on his own.  Russians aren‚Äôt going to commit a political murder on American soil without a damn good reason. They had zero reason, even if they did hack from afar. \n\nAlso, why would she think she was their next target? What possible motives would the Kremlin have to kill DB? Makes no sense and shes offers no rationale. \n\nBut if Seth was killed because he stole the emails, or because he knew some of what DB is now revealing, then it makes perfect sense for DB to be scared. \n\n'
'We have to remember one thing with her talking about Seth Rich... She blamed the Russians for his death, she feared being snipered by the Russians, not her own party.  I think she, in her mind, is making Seth Rich a victim of Russian snipers, nothing to do with her party, but to do with "Trump\'s collusion" & how dangerous Trump is for colluding w them. Clearly fake collusion, but she\'s still playing that card using Seth Rich. Its like shes saying, "the Russian collusion (w Trump) is dangerous, Seth Rich was killed bc of it."'

'My Donna Brazile Theories.\n\n**A.** She was trapped.

Have Seth Rich killed. Podesta knows for sure it was Seth Rich who did this, prior to him being killed, so he is 100% a suspect, as well as whoever was involved in this converstion.\n\nSeth Rich was a likeable dude, and as the lead tech, was probably close to Brazile. She knew exactly what went down after hearing that DNC emails were stolen, and that Seth Rich was responsible. He ends up dead. She gets scared that they can come for her next. She was now their puppet.\n\nB. Bill Clinton is a rapist infowars.com\n\nC. She was in on it, and is now projecting his death to further lead people into thinking Russia had part of this. \n\nMy bets are on A, and B. C is how the media is spinning it, as well as Hillary and Pedosta. '

'Perhaps she feels guilty for his death. '

"DB knew about the corruption within the DNC for a long time.  She was aware of the HFA takeover when it all started.

She was also aware of the fact that POC were used as patsies for the various ratline ops.  DB used SR to get the data to JA.  She gave debate questions.. went along with russian narrative as cover.

Because getting proven wrong publicly is humiliating and embarrassing.\n\nKind of like when I saw a guy who brought up, as a major criticism of Trump, LYING. Of all things; a supporter of HRC criticizing her opponent for *lying*? Now, if I were an HRC supporter, my first thought would be "No matter what, I shouldn\'t go anywhere *near* the topic of lies/lying; if I so much as mention that word, that sets me up for instant attacks, bc the candidate *I* supported is a proven liar dating back decades." But this guy went out of his way to mention "lying" as a criticism of *Trump*! I know it\'s classic projection, but it still blows my mind. From the Trump supporter POV, imagine how dumb it would be for me to raise, as a criticism of HRC, that she has a lot of money. That would be *insane*, because the guy I support... has a lot of money!\n\nHow does one ever expect to win an argument, when there is seemingly not even an ounce of thought given before making a statement?

'Probably the reason why Muslim women have to be veiled is because Mohammed would be jealous of his wives being seduced by other men. See Surah (chapter) 3, verse 55 of the Koran where Mohammed, who is too shy to say it himself, gives "Allah\'s" commandment to his men not to ogle his wives and to not marry them and to not stay in his house for too long. This is one of the most ridiculous verses in the Koran, and it\'s the one that highlights that it\'s a glorified wish list the most. \n\n\n\n[Surah 33:53]:(https://quran.com/33/53)\n\n>O you who have believed, do not enter the houses of the Prophet except when you are permitted for a meal, without awaiting its readiness. But when you are invited, then enter; and when you have eaten, disperse without seeking to remain for conversation. Indeed, that [behavior] was troubling the Prophet, and he is shy of [dismissing] you. But Allah is not shy of the truth. And when you ask [his wives] for something, ask them from behind a partition. That is purer for your hearts and their hearts. And it is not [conceivable or lawful] for you to harm the Messenger of Allah or to marry his wives after him, ever. Indeed, that would be in the sight of Allah an enormity.'

Nor are we tearing down tributes to Theodore Roosevelt, who, in 1891, after 11 falsely accused Sicilian-Americans were murdered in the largest mass lynching in American history, wrote that he thought the event ‚Äúa rather good thing.‚Äù\n\n>**It was in reaction to these tragic killings that the early Italian-American community in New York scraped together private donations to give the monument at Columbus Circle to their new city.** So this statue now denigrated as a symbol of European conquest was from the beginning a testament to love of country from a community of immigrants struggling to find acceptance in their new, and sometimes hostile, home.\n'

In reality we only need about 40% of our society to be in college and most should be working their asses off instead of joining pantifa while living in Mom and dads house leeching off of the insurance until they‚Äôre 26. People emerge from college brainwashed, hating America, feeling like victims, and with tens of thousands of dollars in debt to the government and the banks with no job prospect capable of allowing the debt to be paid off.

The benefits have been reaped, the deal was closed.    I get that the employee would be terminated because that's no way to do business.    Where's the line when it comes to repercussions?   \nBasically, if a boss says do this degrading thing if you want the promotion and you do it and get the promotion, can you still press charges years later?   If it was days later would that be different? \nIf the offended refused and reported it would be clear harassment.   If they refused and reported much later it would be probable harassment.    What happens when they agree and report?"

'The twitter images of this are so sad. Seeing all those bodies motionless is so heartbreaking. When will Europe stop bending to Islam? These economic migrants do not want to coexist. They are there to take until there is nothing left, and then kill all those that remain. Read about the politics of Islam . It demands this. '
"They don't care because this has NOTHING to do with racism or any of that bullshit. This is all about trapping Trump. Russia failed, and they had to keep the shit storm raging. Too bad for them that we don't care and we don't believe bullshit polls and we don't read click bait."
"That's what we all expected. Media and the cunt leftists will never utter a word about radical Islam, but hey, when a rally is organised by white, they will scream from the bottom of their lungs."
"The left, the media, and the 'establishment' will make the same arguments they always do, #notallmuslims, these are a radicalized few, Islam doesn't preach violence etc etc etc.  Notice this is the exact opposite approach taken by these same groups concerning what happened on the weekend -  whites were guilty by association.  I saw multiple posts across most every sight of white people being told to apologize, speak out, condemn, etc. because if they didn't they were equally as responsible.\nSeems like a bit of a contradiction in the lefts philosophy, but as one philosopher once said, there are no contradictions, when you run into one, check your premise.\nThe left, or the newly dubbed 'alt-left', doesn't give a shit about equity, or equality, the leftist ideals, that are so dominant in our culture, are about power - they want it, plain and simple.  So, when they can use their identity politics to attack what they perceive to be the 'power group', which of course is a construct they built, they run with it, and when the 'oppressed' group lashes out violently, which is all part of the plan and is encouraged (i.e. punch a nazi), suddenly the identity politics seem to fall away, and they are back to assessing individuals, almost as individuals.  It's a disgusting and manipulative moral and ethical trick.\nSocialsim/Communism has been doing this since the 1910s  if I recall correctly, the first group they went after was the farmers, then then the farmers got killed, so they when after the aristocrats.  It's the problem when you play their game or give them an inch, they change the group of the 'oppressed' at the drop of a hat all the while expanding the 'power group'.\nNotice how a year or so ago it was 'white male privilege' then it was 'white privilege' and now it's 'whites who don't explicitly condemn neo-nazis'.\nJordan Peterson has an excellent video on Postmodernism, which is what the alt-left is. Highly suggest checking it out."
"Lately, more and more innocent victims across the West have been killed in car attacks. This is why we need to implement common sense car control. Now, some car nuts will whine about how they neeeeed their cars, or the government is trying to take away their right to drive. Don't listen to them. We just want to implement a few basic car violence reduction measures, like limiting the capacity of vehicles and reducing the speed so you can't get up enough momentum to run down children. After the horrific car attack in my college town of Isla Vista, the father of one of the victims started the campaign #NotOneMore to eliminate car violence, and I will not rest until #NotOneMore person is killed by maniacs wielding semiautomatic cars."
"It's not just the alt-left:\n1. They consider all Muslims an oppressed group in America, and they think it's because they are mostly brown\n2. They think Islamic terror is a non-issue or would be a non-issue if we just didn't fight them\n3. They think focusing on the ideology of terrorists will increase number 1. and 2. so they rather ignore it."
'FUCK THE ALT-LEFT!!!'
'Had a friend in Facebook complaining because Trump so quickly tweeted about this attack. Obviously the only reason he would mention this is because he hates all Muslims. '
'They dont care that many people died because it distracts the media from shitting on Trump.\n\nThese are the people who allegedly care about ethics.  Fucking nonsense.'
"They only beat the drums for the dems. Dems don't want to talk about the side effects of their kind of policies. So the drum stopped beating, until a Russia thing comes out tomorrow, in an effort for the media to maintain grip on the attention spans of their underlings: the libtards."

'Many people are calling the statue of Vladimir Lenin in Seattle \'art\'.  I guess because he didn\'t particularly target blacks for extermination his statue is art instead of one that needs to get removed? When people object we are told that we don\'t understand the story behind it and therefore can\'t comment.  The story is not interesting or important in the least.  Some asshole from the area saw it in Czechoslovakia with a homeless guy living in it and brought it over here to sell since it would be such a shame to destroy "art" that the Communist Party had commissioned.  Now it\'s a permanent fixture.  I wonder if Seattle even knows it represents the displacement of a homeless man because that should be pushing their buttons for sure.  Is that because it was for the greater good?  What good?\n\nThe big barrier here is that it\'s on private property and is private property itself so there isn\'t much that can be done about it I think.  Just surprised Seattle wouldn\'t be protesting en masse such a brutal and evil man.  I would bet that the confederate statue at Lake View Cemetery (which is part of American history) gets removed while this beast (which is not) stays.  I really despise this place these days but kudos to the liberal mayor (Ed Murray) for asking that Lenin also be removed.  Consequently this mayor has been railroaded out of office by scandal allegations from way back in the 80\'s that magically surfaced in an election year.  Not saying he\'s innocent or guilty but I find that suspicious.  I\'m not surprised that he has some history of being labeled a pervert by CPS being a gay man back in the 80\'s and all.'
'Also, "intellectuals." These fools don\'t realize that in the communist life cycle, if their desires even materialize into an actual communist state, they are the first to be killed, to solidify power and eliminate any capable of staging a counter-revolution. \n\nOf course, they\'re just idiots who want meaning in their lives, and so see performing these neo-religious sacraments against "the man" as being the most hipsterish way to signal virtue. It\'s now an established pattern that started in the 60s. \n\nThe Red Guard were eventually killed or rusticated. '
"There's a large percentage of that population who think G. W. Killed more people than Stalin. "
'What is striking to me is the sheer amount of either ignorance, or benevolence, towards history and the overwhelming evidence of damage that communism/socialism causes.  In example, Hitler and the Nazis systematically killed around 25 million people, those ideas, and people responsible, are rightfully vilified for their horrific actions. Yet, Mao and Stalin are responsible for upwards of 150 million deaths (high estimates because nobody really knows how many people those assholes actually killed), and these Neo-Marxist/Post-Modernists continue to be apologetic towards socialism. As if they were "Stalin for a day", they would be the benevolent dictator, they are delusional with their utopian ideas, they would either become the monstrous dictator that communism always produces, or they would be killed by a stronger rival whom would then usher in a dystopian future. From an economic standpoint I beg anyone to show me where Communism/Socialism has actually uplifted the poor, more than Capatilism has. Don\'t get me started on political correctness and what sort of authoritarian bullshit it is. America already had this argument in the 1930s, it was either Communism or Facism, America chose a the third option, Democracy. The fact that we are still having this debate today is evidence of a sheer ignorance of history and the "liberal" infiltration of college universities that seeks to destroy America.'

'NATO should also check how members actually spend the money. As a former conscripted soldier in Norway I have seen just how much money is spent on useless stuff. Office buildings full of people with Stars and Stripes on their shoulders, while we used equipment left by the Germans after ww2. \nNorway‚Äôs biggest battalion is the kings guard with its ~1200 soldiers. \nNorway‚Äôs entire defense strategy if the Russians attack is die slow enough for the Americans to arrive. '
"Long time lurker,  I finally made an account to say this.  What if we just.....set our spending to 2&#37; until everyone else pulls their weight.  Or better yet, **set our spending equal to the lowest spender**.  Bet everyone would get on Luxembourg's freeloading ass.  Consider [this](https://countryeconomy.com/countries/compare/luxembourg/usa), 2017 GPD per capita, Luxembourg: $105,914, compared to 2017 GDP per capita USA:$59,501.  They have 1.78 times the money we have per citizen and pay 13.8&#37; of what we pay, to defend Europe.  Their home, not mine.  While they use the savings for heavily subsidized college and healthcare.  Why are my tax dollars subsidizing a group of rich first world countries that take every opportunity to be smug pricks while my entire home state, region, and country desperately needs a break?  If they don't take their own defense seriously and get screwed, how many times do they expect us to come save them (while crying that they don't want us to play world police) before we realize they wont act like adults and they actually bother to have some contingency planning for foreign invasion or natural disasters?  "
"NATO is an alliance designed to defend against an enemy that disappeared from the face of the earth nearly 30 years ago. It is OBSOLETE. That is the reality, but since nobody will admit this basic fact, Trump has brilliantly forced the issue by raising the spending issue. Germany and Italy don't spend their fair share. They reason they don't spend their fair share is because any politician who suggests slashing social spending to fund tanks to fight an enemy that no longer exists would rightly get voted out of office. But Trump is forcing them to either make that exact argument, or admit the truth the NATO is obsolete. The man is a genius! "
'Jesus Christ. \n\nWhy are we the only ones paying that much of our GDP?\n\nIf everyone else paid 1% more and us a few less we‚Äôd have a shit ton of my hard earned dollars back home. \n\nDamnit. \n\nAnd libs have even been asking for us to spend less on military budget. Yet in the same breath decry when GEOTUS attempts to negotiate better terms and hold our so called NATO allies accountable.  \n\nThis makes me ruhl dang angry. '
"Let's cut it all back until the EU stops bringing in refugees. It's going to go to a population that wants us dead in 20 years, fuck the whole thing.\n\nI think that's what Trump was lowkey doing in this whole thing.  You wanna stuff your country to destroy it?  Cool, I'm not funding it, and you're such fuckups, I'll be able to just point to Russia so nobody can cry about it.  "
"When you look at the state of America near or around the 2008 crash. This should have been Obama's first line of attack.\n\nHe should have cut this way way back to help Americans in need.  \n\nIt shouldn't be a case of Trump waiting till others pay up. America should be cutting back on funding NATO regardless of what other countries do.\n\nAmerica will always be there to help defend its allies. But the world is not like that anymore. The only threat of a large land invasion is Russia. If China went full retard their markets would collapse. That would collapse the government and the country.\n\nSpoiler alert. Russia is not that country anymore and China would never risk a full out war.  \n\nIn today's world, there is no need for NATO.

'Very disappointed with AL\'s vote last night.\n\n1) Moore never had a chance, and the GOP acted against him. Remember Flake\'s donation and Shelby\'s announcement on Sunday? The press treated the accusations as fact and editorialized outside of its opinion pages when it referred to him as "accused child molester Roy Moore."\n\n2) Yet Alabama picked Moore in the primary. To pick the man and then not carry him enough to hold a seat against a liberal until 2020 is astounding. If you didn\'t like him, why didn\'t you pick Strange so at least we\'d have a stronger majority in the Senate?\n\nI hope the right choice is made in 2020. Until then, this has given the left a rallying cry. '

The whole "shield maiden" thing is a revisionist history myth.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9vcRzerT2E'
'Shamelessly copy-pasting what I posted on the other post of this image:\n\nThere were no female warriors. Now, I am *technically* exaggerating but in the ancient world strength determined the victor and women are not as strong as a man. Sure, there may have been a *few* (emphasis on few) women throughout history who may have picked up a weapon at some point in time, but to extrapolate that there were legendary female warriors or that women served in the military is bullshit.\n\nThey dig up these graves and find a woman with a sword. That\'s cute, but it doesn\'t mean she was a warrior. That may have been her husband\'s sword or a family heirloom. They might even look at the skeleton to discern some sort of injury but the fact remains people got injured. Bones got broken outside of battle, too. These feminist "scholars" fail every bit of scrutiny when the real historians and archaeologists look at these bodies. Women get buried with a bow and some arrows and yet their skeleton\'s arms are symmetrical. news flash - archers had one arm larger than the other because of the stress a bow places upon the arm. Women would not use a sword and shield, because with each arm carrying a tool they will tire much quicker than a man, women would operate much better with a two-handed longsword for melee or a crossbow for ranged combat.\n\nBut throughout Feminist Revisionist History we see a continuous need to say half of all warriors were women. No, that\'s retarded. Not stupid, not ignorant, outright retarded. The Amazons didn\'t exist. Boudica didn\'t exist. We have no records indicating any of these stories of strong females are based in reality. And the logic is fucking simple. Women can make one baby a year, Men can impregnate one woman an hour. Children had a much higher mortality rate than nowadays so it was necessary for women to reproduce as much as possible. A tribe with 100 women and 1 man will produce 100 babies a year, a tribe with 1 woman and 100 men will die in a generation. The last place you put a valuable, fragile reproducer is in a fucking spear wall formation in the face of death. There\'s a reason the few stories of women doing amazing things. Yes, Mary Bankes defended Corfe castle from 600 men with a force of 5 men, later aided by 80 more men. But that\'s not because she was some incredible warrior who slew all in her path - she was a woman who lived in the most impenetrable castle ever built.....built by men who hauled stone and invented and built the gatehouses and battlements that would allow anyone at all to repel trained soldiers.'
'Shill Nye can go to hell. '
"Let the record show that the Left also said it's racist and sexist to say people have different skeletons, and that it's impossible to tell the difference between male and female"

'Perceived "racism" is a higher crime than jokes about raping children.  That\'s where they are coming from.'
"Well the turnaround on Roseanne losing her show was extremely fast because she's not a leftist.  It usually takes them a bit longer to accept that a leftist has fucked up to the point where they have to cut ties.  I assume Sony will get out of this thing, it can't possibly be worth it to them, I'm sure the movie is a pile of shit that nobody would have even heard about if not for all of this."

"Old neighbor of mine was a wealthy Iranian guy whose parents worked with the British embassy. They got the family out of Iran a day before the Ayatollah took over. He said if they had waited 1 day longer, they literally would have cut his parents heads off for being collaborators and they'd probably be dead too. They lost almost everything, massive properties around Teheran, cars, etc."
"Suspicious timing. Seems to be an attempt to disrupt Iran's intervention in Syria which is coming to a close, the main offensive on Idlib has begun and HTS/Al Qaeda are being routed. Thousands of Iranian militia are involved. \n\nIf this is a foreign run operation, it will give the ayatollahs all the ammo they need to forever snuff the opposition and end the semi-democratic presidential/council power sharing system. The Islamic council wields immense power and chances are every person you see in these videos and pictures will cease to exist within a week. This would weaken the regime and isolate it further. \n\nHalf arsed coups never helped anybody. See Iran for reference. It was an uncoordinated rebellion against the puppet King that gave the Ayatollahs the chance to co-opt the revolution and dig in. There are no prospective factions in the opposition camp that could achieve the same. Any that do exist will be opportunistic and extreme, like the Ayatollahs, and will most likely be from abroad.  \n\nIran's indigenous democratic tradition died in the 50's. \n\nIf we really want to see sunni-led extremism destroyed, and attacks on the west ended, this needs to happen in Saudi Arabia with full backing from the west. A compromised Iran (more than it already is) will see a rise in Wahhabism-the primary enemy of modern civilization. It is not centered in Iran, but it will seek to spread anew as it did in Syria and Iraq and then to Europe if Iran is toppled. \n\nThe Shiite Ayatollahs primary enemy is not Israel, or the west. It is Sunni Wahhabism. I would observe the situation with extreme caution, too early to root for a revolutionary faction-because that could very well be ISIS or Al Qaeda, both of which still have a serious presence in Syria, Egypt, Libya, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iraq, Nigeria, Somalia, Chad and Afghanistan. Having them take influence or territory in Iran won't help the civilized world. \n\nIran's Islamic theocracy may be shitty (chiefly for the domestic population) but it is helping contain something far worse, that is a danger to all. A similar scenario exists in the part of Assad in Syria. Realistic alternatives to him are far worse for the world. "

Blacks are absolutely at the bottom of our society now and they blame whites but we haven\'t changed except to become more bleeding heart liberal.  The brown demographic of this country is what has changed dramatically (increased and gotten more political power) and all that "diversity" has displaced the black people.

'A repost from my >libertarian< self, for all the "but... free market" posers that will come on.  This has nothing to do with the free market.  It\'s contract fraud and advertisement fraud.  We aren\'t talking about banning users, but secretly doing it to obtain value through frauds and deception.  There isn\'t one thing the technology companies are doing that people are complaining about that is free market - it is all the abrogation of the free market.    \n--------------------------------.      \nShadow banning - a fraudulent behavior that cheats its victim of the only thing they are getting value out of - in secret! - and which is the thing social media is making money off of - user generated content.  \n.   \nIt\'s basically a contract violation-I give my content-not for free! I have a user agreement and certain expectations, and twitter (or whoever) violates it in secret and STEALS my content,gives me nothing for it,and hides the fact so my friends, advertisers, and I don\'t leave or take back all our content and roundly give them the bad PR they deserve, and so advertisers are defrauded out of the dollar they are spending on who they reach. All of this is not to say you can\'t ban users/posts - BUT CAN NOT ethically do it in secret without notifying all parties.  \n.  \nPlease note, as carriers like telecommunications companies, who are simply connecting users, they may not be entitled to do even that much. Laws don\'t change or can be ignored simply because you get new technology. Telephone companies can\'t discriminate like that, but at a minimum, you can not defraud participants without notifying them and doing it IN THE SHADOWS, in secret. The mere fact you are doing it in secret shows bad faith, and that legally ought to come in play in any lawsuits. . Of course, this is ignoring a lot of other lawbreaking that is going on. As this is politically based, MASSIVE FEC violations must be going on. Editing posts in secret, like the CEO of reddit did, is forgery, and defamation. Reading people\'s mail is wiretapping, manipulating search results for elections as google is doing, more FEC violations and election fraud.  \n.  \nWe are >long< past the point technology companies who aren\'t even on the cutting edge anymore, need to be brought under the same laws everyone else is under. Amazon price fixes and discriminates based on real time databases - something illegal offline, and evades taxes on a massive scale while getting special pricing at the post office - which is supposed to be a public service!. Microsoft violates software patents by trying to obtain benefits while keeping source secret -- the whole purpose of patents is share in open so everyone can benefit 20 years later - it is the only reason anything is granted in return. . Ownership rights are made a mockery of by calling bought things "licenses", users are locked out of their own devices with DMCA abuses - it goes on and on.  \n.  \n**End the SODOM and GOMORRAH rape by technology companies in the San Francisco area.**\n\n'

If you get so far the feds come in and you are going to jail and you get to play as Huma Abedin.\n\nHuma Abedin you are trying to put out all these fires from Hillary Clinton and your husband Anthony Weiner.  You have a one use power option called:  She\'s easily confused.  If you put out enough fires you can divorce Anthony Weiner and get free bonus mode of putting the moves on Hillary.  Get Hillary on a desk with her panties off and you get bonus points.  Either way if you put out enough fires you can move onto Loretta Lynch.\n\nLoretta Lynch is you are first given this task to handle HSBC fiasco.  If you get enough HSBC executives to eat you out and offer back room deals for money and free vacation hotspots you then move onto airport mode.  The object is to corrupt enough FBI agents to your side.  At this point you can put the moves on Comey and force him to eat you out.  At this point you are then notified that Bill Clinton is at the air port and you have to play a spy game dodging reporters to get alone time with Bill Clinton in the jet.  At this point you force Bill Clinton to his knees and force him to eat you out.  You get to move to Debbie Wasserman.\n\nDebbie Wasserman first goal is to put a hit out on Bernie Sanders.  You do this by threatening DNC electorates and rigging the election.  There is a level called get the debate questions which involves threatening people with a gun.  You then get a message that there is an inside job where someone has downloaded a ton of DNC emails.  Your job is to try and figure out who did it.  After a while you figure it out and you put a hit on them where they are shot in the back.  You are treated to a cut scene of him being loaded into an ambulance alive but as the door is closed you get a close up that one of the paramedics is Wasserman and she is smiling.\n\nNow, onto Hillary Boss mode.  You are first given the task to try and avoid any questions about Lybia.  It\'s pretty much just hitting, I don\'t remember as many times with "What does it matter at this point." popping up briefly.  Once you are able to hit that you get a dream sequence where as Hillary you are busy trying to kill people who can destroy you as fast you can.  She starts young and as you progress through you keep getting old and older till you hit Seth Rich at which point you realize Wasserman had your back the entire time.  \n\nBonus level of treating staff and secret servicemen like shit can also be found during this level.  You then get to play a level where you try and move towards a point but nothing is working like planned.  At the end of this level you get thrown in a van like a side of beef.  Cut scene of balloons falling and you look like a retard is played upon completion.  \n\nNow, the MP game pops up.  People can enter it as different players and it\'s a contest of who can smash as many phones, hard drives, and Ipads as possible.  Now, you enter the boss level where you are trying to fly around to different states and fighting Donald Trump.  It appears that you can\'t lose and you are winning nonstop with various news reporters coming in and waving banners saying, "Go Hillary!"  On election day, you are shown with your foot on Donald Trumps neck and being told to hit X+Y for finishing move but no matter what you keep getting the scene of the balloons and looking like a retard.  Donald Trump then gets up, brushes himself off, and says, "You\'ve always been a loser.  I just let you think you could win."  He walks off with him winning the election.  Cut scene of your supporters and news reporters crying and throwing fits.  \n\nLast level is a fight game level.  You get to beat up on John Podesta, your husband, smack various other people who have supported you through the years, you also get chances of drinking various liquors and throwing the glasses at them.  Once you drink enough you win and you pass out.  Podesta goes out and tells the supporters that they suck and they need to go home and stop crying on his floor.\n\nEnding cut scene has Hillary writing a book in which she blames everyone but herself for her loss.  At the very end she picks up a gun and comments:  I just need to kill someone.  The picture of a Haiti man on his way to testify to congress pops up and she smiles.  '

"Our globalist controlled media pushes transgenders because it will spread thru ourcyouth like wild fire and cause terrible disruptions in our educational systems and the family unit.

Then the Muslims will use our democratic system to elect a Muslim majority the areas where they live and then nationwide. Once they do Sharia Law will become the law of the land in the USA.

Not my place to lecture someone in their morality or lifestyle. However, my poor stepdad was completely blindsided. Mentally ill is an understatement. Sorry not calling you a she. You are a dude. He claims that since he has always hated his body it must mean he is really a girl. Of course he lives in commiefornia, so he was able to change his name and gender on his license already. Dude needs help not hormones and fake boobs and...whatever it is they get done down there. I don't even want to think about it. Gross. Just fucking gross. I'll always care about him because he is my stepbrother, but I honestly hope I never see him again, because I wouldn't be able to bite my tongue.

The whole point is to drive an emotional wedge between mothers and the husbands and fathers who actually protect them, who are the actual reasons there is any safety anywhere for anyone, having built said safety from their own bravery and justice.\n\nThis is also why the alternate narrative, which is true for actual causes in this case, of state failure to protect, fails completely at the emotional level.  The scared mother does not want to hear that the state cannot protect her children.  She hears that as existential terror, nothing can protect the child, and anything sending that message at such moments will instantly be flagged as threat and predator, itself.\n\nThe guns in schools narrative might seem a good alternative but it is not, because it requires a reframing of the gun itself as a positive tool when it is experienced as the dangerous snake by a woman with no experience of using guns protectively.  *Guards* in schools has some better chance, because at least a guard can be connected with empathically. Those need to be personified as heroes though, and not as sacrificing ones who failed to protect the children in the previous incident.  Anything that leaves the primitive terror unaddressed will not be heard.\n\nNote that influencing policy has next to nothing to do with any of this.  The women doing it experience the collective branding of the threat as empowering, telling them that the community is on their side and will defend them.  They are enraged by resistence but unconsciously it fits and feeds their frame and reassures them they have correctly identified the threat, and if only the community attacks that threat with sufficient ruthless violence they will be safe.  They seek to act all this out in public speech and display.\n\nMen being thereby unjustly assaulted need to understand the forces they are dealing with.  They need to understand that their own just and archetypal protective role is being usurped by an incompetent state and mob opinion that cannot actually protect, thrusting itself between them and their own women and children.\n\nMen need to assure their families that they can and will protect them, personally.  They need to explain that they as men have built the protective institutions of society to support those efforts, but that they have been insufficient in such cases because too distant from the problem to recognize the threat in time.  \n\nDo not try to label the state a snake.  The snake is the shooter and only the shooter.  The threat is limited and not universal.  The demons involved are small fry and you can beat them back.  You need your tools, you need some loyalty, and you need to adjust some of the badly done state actions which were individual personal failings of responsible people and poor incentives, but this can be done and it is being done.\n\nNever ratchet back up the fear, it is your worst enemy in all of this.  The pictures of mass graves and reports of states murdering whole peoples are not helping.  You lose if you wind up in the snake mask; you win if the soccer mom feels that she and her children are safe.'

They let 17 kids die in order to push a campaign to disarm  Americans so they can rule over us. Fuck that shit.\n\n I'm not really into guns, and currently only own two, but I'm going to buy a new semi-automatic rifle asap. Might get a pair of them just for the heck of it. My ancestors didn't fight the British just to have their descendants turn into cucks 250 years later.

It\'s just as easy for a criminal to obtain an illegal firearm, and that\'s practically the same all over the nation.'

'I went to a small catholic elementary school in a medium sized city (about 80k) in Canada.

Took them about 20 years but they finally put a security check in there. \n\nYou can‚Äôt stop crazy people with kindness, and you certainly can‚Äôt stop them with laws. \n\nThere are forces out there that want to destroy you, there are people that want to inflict their own internal pains and struggles externally onto others. \n\nWhile comparing countries with vastly different histories is a favourite pass time of the Left, the one thing they ignore is other means of carnage (bombs, vehicular manslaughter, knives, etc) \n\nIf USA had the same success as Australia at ‚Äòbanning‚Äô guns (20%), that still leaves over 200 million guns in USA. \n\nBetter security is really the only immediate remedy, followed by a crackdown on mental health and depression, and the restoration of the American Family and its values. Which the Left has destroyed. '
"Should't that be up to the teachers. From my understanding most teachers DO NOT want to carry a weapon.  There's a high potential for killing a innocent kid while firing in the fray.   I don't blame them.  How awful would you feel if you took shots at the shooter and also killed some innocent kid.  Teachers are there to teach."

Planned Parenthood kills 80,000 in the same amount of time.  The NRA donates to protect our country... about $30 million to politicians.... nothing compared to Planned Butcherhood.'
"I'm sorry but arming teachers is NOT a solution. You can't expect them to take the life of their a student who they may know well. Heck, even in prison classrooms (I do know a few teachers there), they are trained to back away from situations because they WILL get hurt. \n\nAlso, it's different in Israel because they have mandatory service for everyone and people are all trained to use guns. They are under constant threat of war / violence from neighboring countries and terrorists. \n\nOur teachers are de-facto parents to some students, counselors, and on the front lines of watching children struggle with poverty. We expect them to spend hundreds a year for school supplies too btw because teachers are making up for the gap in school budgets.  \n\nNow, we expect them to take bullets for students and engage them in gun battles? Is that what you want? That's really insane. "
"I actually think this is the wrong answer. Teachers shouldn't be asked to operate in this capacity, they have enough to do. Forget them being armed guards expected to respond in an active shooter scenario-some of them can't even manage to teach students how to read! I am fiercely pro-second amendment, but I would completely understand any parental (or teacher, or student, or legal) objections to this. If you think the answer is more guns, why shouldn't it be more armed and TRAINED law enforcement/security personnel? And can we seriously not figure out how to secure a fucking building in this country? Can we not try actively teaching staff and (older) students to attack, instead of this European-style run and hide bullshit?\n\n I mean, I just think there is a host of other things that could be tried before arming educators in government schools. We also have to consider the psychological effects of armed teachers on the students. For example, don't you think this is something that might teach them that they should accept the conditions of a police state as normal? Armed teachers just rubs me the wrong way entirely. It's not the answer."

'It can happen, especially when it hits closer to home. I\'m very rational on general issues, but I have my moments. With all these terrorist attacks in Europe, sadness, anger and frustration take over (mostly because of the sheeple reactions). The closer they get the harder it hits, especially knowing all this could be avoided. Takes a while to go back to being calm, collected and rational.\n\nI think feelings aren\'t bad per se. Fight or flight isn\'t an active rational process, yet it has helped humanity to survive. Same with together we are stronger... Aren\'t we? They are feelings or attitudes that can be rationalised a posteriori. The problem are these kind of feelings being suppressed by irrational or fabricated feelings, things we "should" (or shouldn\'t) feel because we\'re told so.'

"The 'Town Hall' was a complete charade. CNN is in the business of grotesque reality television and not news. The director last night, Jake Tapper, showcased that when he overruled the young lady who stuttered through her scripted question. Her very dramatic, emotional message got through, but it was sent to the incorrect 'actor' and our conductor Fake Jake made sure to keep everyone on cue and in line with the bogus script. \n\nThere was no intent for genuine discussion. There was no forum for open dialogue. The whole thing was a joke put on by FAKE NEWS CNN for sensationalism and their narcissistic, self-righteous indignation. The American public is on to the mainstream media's degenerate, self-serving ways and they are tuning out BIG TIME!

Never mind the statistics that indicate the real violent behavior and trends, never mind the media never showing you the horrible behavior of Americas most precious black youth as they run rampant state by state murdering each other for shits and giggles because it's the thug life out here playa, you better get ready whitey cuz all lives don't matter, it's only the black ones, and we gon be blacker then every when we get our next black president who won't be the guy who seemingly finds pleasure in bombing his Muslim brothers and sisters just so he could accelerate the NWO agenda behest too his overlords.\n\nxD\n"

"I'd suggest not going into a certain basketball sub at all today.

"The UK's murder rate is just slightly lower than the US murder rate, despite guns being almost completely illegal in the UK. People still rob places with guns, and people are still stabbed and beaten to death.  But if there was a statistic for the Defend rate rather than the murder rate, I'm guessing the US would far outweigh the UK.\n\nA large part of the US murder rate is due to immigrants, legal or illegal. We may count them as American statistics, but if it's from people who came in the last 50 years, it's actually quite significant, because it shows that the US imports violence/murder. \n\n That's how they get away with hiding a lot of statistics, by hiding them as simply American citizen statistics. But if tens of millions of people were only Americans within the last 50 years, that is not just an American problem, that's an immigrant problem.   Immigrant statistics shouldn't stop being tracked once they get citizenship.  It's not wrong or improper to track what immigrants are introducing to our country. "

'The problem obviously is that FBI and the local police are not doing their jobs in some states.  The mentally ill, alcoholics and those with violent crime convictions or threatening recent behavior should not be allowed to have guns. \n\nThey should be checked immediately after receiving any kind of tip about them. That would cut down the homicide rates quite considerably. There is almost always some kind of escalating pattern before they do something really bad.'
'Yes, the same deputies who hide while teachers take charge and jump infront of the gun. I see people arguing that they arent comforable being given a gun, like they think they are being forced. No one is being forced to take a gun. Thats the power of the 2nd amendment, you have the right to bear arms. No one is forcing you to arm yourself and no one is saying you must. Just that you should not be able to take away that right from those who want  to protect themselves and those we care about.'
"That's the worst police department -- I pray they all are not like that!  4 deputies were outside the school and did nothing! Perhaps they were in cahoots with the FBI to do NOTHING EXCEPT PUSH AN AGENDA. Now we find out the schools didn't want the police in the schools because arresting students looks bad in their statistics!!"
"Knowing there are agenda driven pussy policeman like this and his coward deputies gives me more reason to get a C2C, I've been procrastinating but just applied for one yesterday.  Sad when you have unarmed teachers who use their body as a shield to protect kids, but you have lazy, spineless armed police who run from a crazy fucking gunman, and then to top it off want to unarm patriots."
'Drop dead liberal coward.'
'Ultimately the gun control debate comes down to your view of human nature as a whole. Do you believe your fellow man is principled, disciplined and wise enough to be responsible and law abiding enough to bear arms? Or do you believe we are a nation of children who need to be coddled and protected by Big Daddy Government? That as people we are so helpless and weak that we are not to be trusted with the responsibility to protect ourselves?  \n  \nThe gun control issue is just the surface layer. Until we start asking ourselves the big questions we are doomed to the "Guns don\'t kill people" vs. "If guns are illegal it\'s harder for killers to get them" debate, which is safe to say isn\'t getting us anywhere.'

'Ban all phones especially for those between 18-21 - not only are they a danger to themselves but others who become victims:\n\nAt this point I think most people realize just how big of a problem and how dangerous distracted driving is.  However, seeing this list of 25 distracted driving statistics all together in one long list really can put it into perspective. Going through and reading these statistics proving the dangers of distracted driving and then realizing that millions of people still drive while distracted is a sad truth.\n\n    Over 2.5 million people in the U.S. are involved in road accidents each year. The population of the US is just 318.9 million. At this rate, the American people could be extinct in two human lifespans. This is an astounding number of traffic accidents.\n    Of these, 1.6 million have a cell phone involved in them. That‚Äôs 64% of all the road accidents in the United States. Over half the road accidents in the States have cell phones involved, and if this doesn‚Äôt make you realize just how potent it is, what will?\n    37,000+ people die in automobile crashes in the U.S every year\n    Every year, about 421,000 people are injured in crashes that have involved a driver who was distracted in some way.\n    Each year, over 330,000 accidents caused by texting while driving lead to severe injuries. This means that over 78% of all distracted drivers are distracted because they have been texting while driving.\n    1 out of 4 car accidents in the US are caused by texting while driving.\n    Texting and driving is 6 times more likely to get you in an accident than drunk driving. That‚Äôs right, it is actually safer for someone to get wasted and get behind the wheel than to text and do it.\n    It takes an average of three seconds after a driver‚Äôs mind is taken off the road for any road accident to occur. This is the bare minimum amount of time it takes, and it is surprisingly small. Three seconds is the time it takes to turn your ignition when starting your car.\n    Reading a text message while driving successfully distracts a driver for a minimum of five seconds each time. This means that the chances of an accident occurring while reading a text is extremely high indeed.\n    The average speed in the US is about 55mph. Taking five seconds to read a text in this time means that the driver travels the length of a football field without looking at the road, or being distracted. There are so many vehicles on the road now that this means there is a huge chance of something terrible happening in this distance.\n    When you text while driving, the time that you spend with your eyes off the road increases by about 400%. It is already dangerous enough to be distracted by NATURE while driving. So why make things 4 times as bad by texting?\n    The chances of a crash because of any reason is increased by 23 times when you are texting. Even if the crash is another driver‚Äôs fault, you will probably have been able to avoid it if you had been looking at the road instead of the phone.\n    When you compare this to the 2.8 times more risk that dialing a number on a phone imparts, you know that you are playing with fire.\n    Every day, 11 teenagers die because they were texting while driving.\n    94% of teenagers understand the consequences of texting and driving, but 35% of them admitted that they do it anyway.\n    Of all the teenagers ever involved in fatal accidents every year, 21% were using a cell phone at the time of the accident.\n    Teen drivers have a 400% higher chance of being in a car crash when texting while driving than adults.\n    25% of teens respond to at least one text while driving, every single time.\n    10% of adults and 20% of teenagers have admitted that they have entire conversations over text message platforms while driving.\n    82% of American teenagers own a cell phone, and use it regularly to call and text message.\n    52% of these talk on the phone while driving, and 32% text on the road.\n    When polled, 77% of adults and 55% of teenage drivers say that they can easily manage texting while driving.\n    When teens text while they drive, they veer off lane 10% of their total drive time.\n    A study at the University of Utah found out that the reaction time for a teen using a cell phone is the same as that of a 70 year old who isn‚Äôt using one.\n    48% of kids in their younger teenage years have been in a car while the driver was texting. Over 1600 children in the same age group are killed each year because of crashes involving texters.\n\nI want thank the people at ICEBIKE.ORG for sending me over these statistics and the original article published on their site that included them.

"The thing I don't understand is that women perpetually claim to be the victim.  Look at all these sexual harassment accusations being thrown around now.  Then they want to be elected or promoted or hired to positions of management and leadership.  You can't hold yourself out as being a victim your entire life, then expect people to trust you a position of leadership, competition and responsibility, having to make tough decisions and navigate complicated situations.\n\nVictims are seen as weak and do not instill confidence and trust in others."

'Frustrating to see he did nothing so far to Obama/HRC crime gang despite mounting evidence while angel Trump is investigated for so-called collusion!'
'In the case of Moore it is not as if the accusers came out at a random time.  They specifically decided to come out a month before the election.  Certainly the timing brings into question the motives and validity of their claims.  You can argue this is bad timing for Moore and Republicans, but it is also bad timing for the accusers if they didn‚Äôt want their claims scrutinized.  It‚Äôs like claiming someone sexually assaulted you the day after the accused wins the Powerball jackpot.  It‚Äôs very fishy.  \n\nMoore has completely denied the allegations, while others like Louis CK and Spacey have not.  Now in the case of Louis CK, I really don‚Äôt see much issue.  Sure, his requests were inappropriate, but don‚Äôt constitute sexual assault or harassment, in my opinion.  I don‚Äôt think it is really fair to group him with Takai and Spacey.  But Spacey can basically said, I was drunk and I‚Äôm gay and be given somewhat of a pass by the media, but Moore is being raked over the coals. '

However, I have a major problem when assholes ahead of me blatantly staring at their phones while driving, swerving between lanes, and not paying attention to traffic, or anyone else around them. Total disregard for fellow drivers, the law, and safety of the roads. If your phone can't wait until your home or safely pulled over somewhere, than you shouldn't be allowed to drive. I lost my mother in a brutal car accident and have no respect for those who endanger others while driving. \n\nSecondly. The left lane is for passing.

Rates of criminality are far higher amongst illegal immigrants than among legal immigrants.'
"So why should everyone else wait in line then? It seems that we are rewarding people who do it illegal way. I agree that its not the child's fault, but the parent knew the risk of doing what they did. They should own up and be responsible. It was the parent who messed up. Stop blaming people for wanting to enforce the law. My family had to wait 21 years, in limbo, not sure if we would be approved. What they are doing is not fair. What a big FU to people who follow the law.  And guess what, I know tons of people from the Philippines who would love to live here and would contribute greatly to this country.

Trump breaks 3% growth, holy fuck the Russians did this!  They are colluding to improve our economy and strengthen gun rights?  Duh fuck kind of mental gymnastics these people pull...    Now we have over 4% quarterly growth that is showing no signs of slowing down and they are absolutely beside themselves.  DNC rigged their own party elections that in part, got Trump elected.

Watt who *isn\'t* "protesting").  Just like all the rest of the Left\'s "protests", this is pure virtue signaling.  It\'s lazy "activism".  I don\'t doubt that Leftists actually want to do something, it\'s just that they\'re lazy, and only willing to help people in the most cursory of ways, and only if it doesn\'t inconvenience them.  In this case, by not standing during the national Anthem.  Yeah, that\'s helping loads of people.'

'What is the "demand" these protests aim to achieve-- so they will know when to stop kneeling? When a particular person is released, convicted, or exonerated? When nobody ever gets killed by the police again? When there is finally no more perceived racism anywhere? Kinda vague and impossible, it seems they have painted themselves into a corner. Guess they have to kneel every time forever now?'

I'll take the cardboard box that she was shipped in from the hospital.\n\nAt most a funeral should cost maybe $2,000 or $4,000 if you want to be able to have a viewing (which requires embalming and corpse presentation so that everyone can get there in time).\n\nIdeally all that should be required is that you notify the authorities that a person has died and then you're allowed to bury the person on whatever land you may own (with a caveat that if you ever sell the land you have to disclose to the buyer where - but chances are you'll put a gravestone there anyway) or just burn the body in your backyard Funeral Pyre style.\n\nThe only reason you're not allowed to do that stems from The Church requiring that all bodies be handled and buried on Church grounds - thus meaning you have to pay The Church."

'Seriously. All I posted on Facebook is that he called MS-13 animals, and no one else. I had multiple people defending them. Having mostly liberal friends, I\'ve seen a lot of stuff I don\'t agree with and a lot of simple disagreements on my posts. But on today\'s post, people were actually defending the most violent gang in the world, even after I pointed out that they were defending an international crime enterprise that participates in drug smuggling, rape, murder, extortion and human trafficking. One person actually argued that sending them back to Central America made the US as bad as them. Another person argued that their numbers are inflated. Another person said that it was obvious Trump meant "brown immigrants" and not just MS-13, despite it being a direct response to the mention of MS-13 in the first place. Literally, a "he may have said that, but what ACTUALLY meant was this." I\'d honestly never seen that in the wild before. I still cannot wrap my head around the fact that people were vehemently DEFENDING the most dangerous gang in the world. Out of everything I\'ve seen since election season, this is the least flexible mental gymnastics I\'ve witnessed.\n\n2020 is going to be so easy.'

I did not once hear a Democrat object to this proposal.\n\nLiberals will defend literally anything that Trump hates. Can't wait for Trump to lay some hate on Hitler, Stalin, and Satan himself."

Many of us are closer in appearance to Lena Dunham. So when you mock her for her appearance, you're mocking a lot of women, many who are republicans.\n\nI'd prefer if we left the criticizing and body shaming to the Democrats. \n\nHaving said that, there's plenty of other non physical reasons to mock Lena Dunham.

'That\'s the thing I don\'t get about it being "racist" to learn English. If you don\'t know English in the US, you can get by, sure, but you\'re significantly hamstringing yourself in terms of financial and business abilities much less the ability to effectively communicate in potentially dangerous or necessary situations (getting pulled over for example. Not "dangerous" dangerous, but if you don\'t know English and make a wrong move, the cop won\'t wait to ask questions before they taze/shoot you). You can get by because enough other people will speak your language you might be able to find work, raise a family, etc. But the downside to not learning English is otherworldly. Encouraging people to speak English isn\'t racist, it\'s looking out for them on their own behalf. I don\'t want Mexicans to learn English because "fuck those beaners, coming to our country and not knowing the language", not at all. I want them to learn it because it\'s the only way as a first generation legal immigrant and then down the line, you\'ll be able to really achieve anything of any merit.'

When are we (the majority) going to work together and do something?"

"**100% of SocJus accusations are projections,** one hundred point oh, no exceptions whatsoever. They do not SEE anything else besides their own faults. They do not look at the things they slander, which is self-evident to anyone who is capable of the most basic levels of critical thinking.\n\nTrump condemned all violence. MSM picked up all fault from the rent-a-mob and dropped it onto the kids carrying luau lights. *At various moments they've even used slick words to blame the demonstration for the police helicopter crash.* They **SERIOUSLY ACT LIKE** Soros has more of a right to send giant hired attack squads at demonstrations than the demonstrators have a right to assemble (anyone heard of the bill of rights here?) Any state with a Democrat governor can have the mob squad, the permit revoked; this time the police even shoved demonstrators INTO the neo-KKK so the violence could get even worse.\n\nGood thing those states are dwindling. Thanks for staying the course, Dems.\n\n(Spez:) If you live in one of these states, **SAVE ALL EVIDENCE** of allowing demonstrations to turn into war zones thanks to Soros and his buses full of ninjas throwing bottles. Elections are real and so are the consequences."
'Well, that is a very interresting point that you bring up. \n\nWhat is a domestic terorist. \n\nLet me make a mental detour here. \n\nBecause as far as I see, this is the really interresting point: \n\nThat the left are very very very intent on painting it as terrorism, as soon as a right wing guy does it, but when a left wing person does it, it\'s a mentally disturbed individual with no connection whatsoever. \n\nIf you would ask a democrat or a "new american" what a domestic terrorist is, he would most likely spout some lines about how a domestic terrorist uses hatred, and the real divide is hatred, and hate speech.... \n\nIt is actually far easier. \n\nA terrorist uses violence to get a political message through despite the overwhelming majority of people not being for it. \n\nIf you bring into hatred in, you can counter that with Hitler. Hitler was sentenced not because he hated germany, but because he loved it. It was plain to see for the judges, and they went easy on hitler. You wouldn\'t want hitler to get off easy, would you? \n\nLet that sink in. \n\nMind you, I personally do not think the antifa deserves the label terrorist. they are kids, and kids do stupid shit. for fucks sake, I wore clothing that would make me now retch. Can\'t say shit about that. \n\nThe turning point will comne when the left presses this button too far. and you get an actual conversation about domestic terrorism going. \n\nBecause what I see is far too often that the left forgets about the power of media. \n\nWhen I look at a photo of trump supporters, with all the love I am able to, I don\'t see dangerous radicals. I see a couple of goobers out. All this alpha and beta talk is fine and dandy, but at the end, what you get from a trump community  meetup looks like a couple of guys who have no idea how to show support coming along because someone promised beers in a cooler. you got your fat shirts, you got your MAGA hats, but anything in between, fuck it, as diverse as america. and, lets be fair, not particularely threatening. More like a lost family picknick full of that one side of the family that kind of lives rural. Probably would never know wheatgrass was an option in milkshakes, but would know how much you get for wheatgrass at the market. You know, goobers, probably with wood paneling on their subarus. \n\nThe left however? Antifa especially? OOOOh, same clothing, masks to their faces, weapons, martial bearing.... weapons out, paroles..... \n\nNow, I agree, purely on a technical level, it is legal to say, hey, I don\'t agree with you, and you fucking shut your mouth mister.... \n\nBut using violence? throwing of actual baloons filled with piss? beating with sticks? \n\nNow, tell me again, who advocates the use of violence against their political opponents? Openly? I mean, with all the love for antifa, are you SURE you want to have that discussion? \n\nBecause you seem to fit that standart defenition of terrorism pretty well. Not that special definition that you use, you know, the one with "priviledge + power" in it, nd so forth. But the one that says "advocates the use of violence as a political tool. ". The one that says , on wikipedia, "Terrorism, in its broadest sense, describes the use of intentionally indiscriminate violence as a means to create terror or fear, in order to achieve a political, religious or ideological aim". Violence as a tool to archieve a goal. \n\nBecause when we have this discussion, we will look at the great memes. at meme magic. at goobers sitting on PC\'s, and making more or les funny pictures. because that is 90 % of the trump base, at their best. At people who are too inept to make a torch, and have to buy tiki torches at wallmart. \n\nAnd we will look at the berkley attacks, at "smash the fash", at setting hair on fire and bring bikelocks to political demonstrations, at someone picking up a rifle and attempting to shoot senators, and so forth. \n\nWe will look at all of this, and go and use not your or my standart, but the peoples standart. Who will the people think more dangerous? a couple of goobers who are so disorganised they run to wallmart before the demonstration, and buy tiki torches? Making some memes and making people laugh? Or at the people who beat these people? Who advocate that the police should fry like bacon, who throw in windows, and set fire to barricades? \n\nBecause don\'t get me wrong. There are nutters in every corner, even amongst the goobers. I bet right now, a few nutters from the KKK are reading this. And I personally disagree with them on a fist to face level, which makes me a violent nutter too. \n\nBut if you bring up the idea of terrorism, you are not just looking at the edge cases. You are looking at the broad mass. \n\nWhich side is it again that advocates violence? smashing things? fighting on the streets? \n\nWhich side makes internet pictures? \n\nand yea, the right gets radicalised on the internet. in forums, chars, subreddits. \n\nWhere does the left get radicalised? \n\nExactly. In official media outlets, and in public publications. Politicians even. \n\nSo the right loses a subreddit, a forum, maybe even their website. \n\nThe left loses CNN, NBC, salon and so forth. \n\nThe right smilingly just makes a new forum. \n\nThe left must make a new media corporation. \n\nWhat a fair trade. That exchange surely has been beneficial and of great victory to the left. '

"> NUCLEAR WEAPON FUEL\n\nThat's a stupid way to refer to uranium. Russia has the mining, enrichment, and trade capabilities to make all the nukes they want. You don't even use uranium itself in weapons (0.7% of it is fissile): you use it to breed plutonium from the 99.3%. You don't need very much. This doesn't give them new weapons capabilities they didn't have before.\n\nWhere you _do_ use abundant amounts of uranium is fuel for nuclear power plants, an area where the Russians are kicking our butts. This is economic corruption, not a weapons threat. It gives Russia the edge in international markets, and millions to the Clintons."

A lawful country? Their country being defined as a country by its borders and territory? The government not allowing terrorists and people from dangerous countries? Are they resisting standing up to brutal dictators in Asia? Seriously wtf do they think they are resisting?\n\nThis really does annoy me, I was a very lonely figure of resistance in the UK to the EU and political correctness for 15 years of my life. I resisted pc indoctrination, I resisted the takeover of my country by a foreign capital, I resisted mass immigration, I resisted joining the Euro etc etc. THESE ARE THINGS WORTH RESISTING. I resisted, just as many Americans have resisted PC and its end goal, globalism for the past 8 years.\n\nWTF are these idiots resisting? Its been 7 fucking months."

'At what point do these people feel foolish? Played? I felt it back on election night. I wasn\'t for the Democrats by any means, but the results were surprising to me. The very fact that Trump won it made me step outside of the media narrative that I\'d been engulfed in up to that point and I went to watch as many full length speeches as possible, plus a re-viewing of the debates. My conclusion after that and some other reading was to jump fully on the Trump train by the inauguration. I bet you most of these "resist" people haven\'t even done that amount of due diligence and are STILL watching CNN religiously and taking it all at face value. \n\nEventually, all but the most stubborn, idiotic SJWs will have to drop their bullshit a peg or two when none of their claims of doom and gloom come to pass.

"As of now, this post currently sits at 56%.  I've noticed that posts like these are the true crux of the alt-left: they hate it so much they try to bury it.  Similarly on r/all, they will try to push something damaging to Pres. Trump.  Before the speech it was the wiretapping reveal (which only validated Pres. Trump's previous assertions).  Now, it's something about personal funds and lawyers and some losers reaction to the speech based on a wrist watch.  These people are pathetic, truly unAmerican to their core."

"This article is kind of ridiculous.  It blames men not wanting to be in a serious relationship solely based on the premise that app dating is so convenient and there is always something better out there.  This is how women typically think, traditionally, not how a lot of guys think.  It comes as no surprise to me that the article was authored by a female who manages to project this onto the topic.  Many guys that I know and have observed would love to have multiple flings, but more so love the idea of settling down and having a family with someone that loves them back equally.\n\nThe problem is, the head of the household role for men has been diminished and in many cases outright destroyed.  So, that, along with there actually being plenty of options out there has caused many guys to start thinking in ways akin to hypergamy.  Women are catching on to this and starting to hate it because it threatens their sexual marketplace and ability to acquire a man to do all the utility bullshit that they don't want to do.  It was great when it provided women with countless options but now that they are coming to realize it also is providing men with countless options, they start to hate it; because it further lowers their own value in being in control of the relationship.  In other words, it is providing a sort of REAL equality amongst the genders and many women hate it for that.\n\nWhat I'm trying to get at is, no guy really wants to be in a serious relationship anymore after having been directly, or having seen others in his life get shit all over by some ruthless woman.  Who, furthermore, has the backing and protection of the state to behave in such a manner; whereas, were the roles reversed, the guy would be thoroughly lambasted."

"Wow! There is so much wrong with a news organization doing something like this.\nFirst it disregards entirely what Ron Johnson's informant told him. Which means there are two people telling the same joke.\n\nSecond. It disregards all of the other known texts about trying to undermine Trump and the 50,000 missing texts.\n\nThis gets to the heart of why the American people don't trust the media. They run with something like this that has no basis in fact, no journalistic integrity at all and clearly attempts to move the narrative in a highly biased and political way.\n\nSo going forward what we know about ABC is they can't be trusted on any of the reporting around the entire investigation. They have decided to work on political cover for the establishment instead of actual news."

"Islam is the greatest killer of all time, worse than Christianity, fascism or communism. Islamic jihad destroyed a Christian Middle East and a Christian North Africa. Soon it was the fate of the Persian Zoroastrian and the Hindu to be the victims of jihad. The history of political Islam is the destruction of Christianity in the Middle East, Egypt, Turkey and North Africa. Half of Christianity was lost. Before Islam, North Africa was the southern part of Europe (part of the Roman Empire). Around 60 million Christians were slaughtered during the jihadic conquest. Half of the glorious Hindu civilization was annihilated and 80 million Hindus killed. The first Western Buddhists were the Greeks descended from Alexander the Great's army in what is now Afghanistan. Jihad destroyed all of Buddhism along the silk route. About 10 million Buddhists died. The conquest of Buddhism is the practical result of pacifism. Zoroastrianism was eliminated from Persia. The Jews became permanent dhimmis throughout Islam. In Africa over 120 million Christians and animists have died over the last 1400 years of jihad. Approximately 270 million nonbelievers died over the last 1400 years for the glory of political Islam. These are the Tears of Jihad which are not taught in any school.\n\n\nThese figures are a rough estimate of the death of non-Muslims by the political act of jihad.\n\n\nAfrica\n\n\nThomas Sowell [Thomas Sowell, Race and Culture, BasicBooks, 1994, p. 188] estimates that 11 million slaves were shipped across the Atlantic and 14 million were sent to the Islamic nations of North Africa and the Middle East. For every slave captured many others died. Estimates of this collateral damage vary. The renowned missionary David Livingstone estimated that for every slave who reached a plantation, five others were killed in the initial raid or died of illness and privation on the forced march.[Woman‚Äôs Presbyterian Board of Missions, David Livingstone, p. 62, 1888] Those who were left behind were the very young, the weak, the sick and the old. These soon died since the main providers had been killed or enslaved. So, for 25 million slaves delivered to the market, we have an estimated death of about 120 million people. Islam ran the wholesale slave trade in Africa.\n\n\n120 million Africans\n\n\nChristians\n\n\nThe number of Christians martyred by Islam is 9 million [David B. Barrett, Todd M. Johnson, World Christian Trends AD 30-AD 2200, William Carey Library, 2001, p. 230, table 4-10] . A rough estimate by Raphael Moore in History of Asia Minor is that another 50 million died in wars by jihad. So counting the million African Christians killed in the 20th century we have:\n\n\n60 million Christians\n\n\nHindus\n\n\nKoenard Elst in Negationism in India gives an estimate of 80 million Hindus killed in the total jihad against India. [Koenard Elst, Negationism in India, Voice of India, New Delhi, 2002, pg. 34.] The country of India today is only half the size of ancient India, due to jihad. The mountains near India are called the Hindu Kush, meaning the ‚Äúfuneral pyre of the Hindus.‚Äù\n\n\n80 million Hindus\n\n\nBuddhists\n\n\nBuddhists do not keep up with the history of war. Keep in mind that in jihad only Christians and Jews were allowed to survive as dhimmis (servants to Islam) everyone else had to convert or die. Jihad killed the Buddhists in Turkey, Afghanistan, along the Silk Route, and in India. The total is roughly 10 million. [David B. Barrett, Todd M. Johnson, World Christian Trends AD 30-AD 2200, William Carey Library, 2001, p. 230, table 4-1.]\n\n\n10 million Buddhists\n\n\nJews\n\n\nOddly enough there were not enough Jews killed in jihad to significantly affect the totals of the Great Annihilation. The jihad in Arabia was 100 percent effective, but the numbers were in the thousands, not millions. After that, the Jews submitted and became the dhimmis (servants and second class citizens) of Islam and did not have geographic political power.\n\n\nThis gives a rough estimate of 270 million killed by jihad.

'#Shitlam - Never trust. Never Hire. Never Solicit. Remove if you can. Prevent more from Coming In. Never Turn your Back. Never give them ANY leeway. This stuff is dangerous and is a scourge.\n\n \nWhen speaking of islam and what muslims do never forget - taqiyaa/takiyya, tawriya, kitman, muruna.\n\ntaqiyya/takiyaa (lying to achieve goals for Islam is obligatory), tawriya (concealing, lying), kitman (partial truth), muruna (flexibility to blend in, ability to break the rules to blend in for a larger goal).\nI hate to break to everyone, but those people in the religion of \'peace\' are not afraid of anything but strength. The kaffirs of the world had best get a set of balls and get ready to end the scourge. All the kafirs will be killed (Harbis are killed), brutally taxed (Dhimmis are taxed) or converted if you let this happen. Religion of "peace"-ers will employ Taqiyya, Kitman, murana and tawirya and lie like rugs until you let down your guard, the gain critical mass and then poof! too late.\nBe aware the Islamists using Taqiyya, Kitman, murana and tawirya on Dhimmi kafirs (the rest of us).\n\nStop these murderous demons of the 7th century! Stop the Black-Flag of the Horde of Islam from creeping across humanity!\n\n...Takiyya is defined as dissimulation about ones Muslim identity...\n...Tawriya is defined as concealing, and it could be called "creative lying"...\n...Kitman is characterized by someone telling only part of the truth. The most common example of this is when a Muslim says that jihad really refers to an internal, spiritual struggle...\n...Muruna means using "flexibility" to blend in with the enemy or the surroundings...\n\nAlways remember. taqiyaa/takiyya, tawriya, kitman, muruna.\n\n#https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdJDeeiWevo\n'
"Surah 4:34:\n\n>Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth.

But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance - [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them.

If you had that many guns and that many clips, why is it taking as long as 40 seconds between each 50 round burst?\n\n3a.

And they try to tie it to Russia? Jesus Christ is that retarded. That\'s literally like saying, "Pakistan\'s nuclear program was made possible by black market purchases of technology from a Korean factory with historical ties to Japan." Literally true, but ignores the fact that North Korea has not been part of the Japanese Empire since 1945.'
'They\'re already failing. Their main "gotcha" to counter Trump\'s election fraud claim is that it isn\'t proven, and there is no conclusive evidence.

Perhaps I\'ll hollow out the roles of men, the builders of Western civilization. That historical portion of Western civilization is offensive, and needs to be removed.

'The comment is accurate, and it also shows the proper response.\n\nTrump should go to Gettysburg and quote in full the Gettysburg address.

Then he should tweet "Let our honored dead rest in peace."'
'Ironically this argument should been had generations ago when Southern states were actually using the history of the Old Confederacy to push and defend Jim Crow. \n\nThe truth is that most of the Confederacy were dupes. And they paid for it with blood, suffering, and impoverishment. What the Confederacy fought to defend was a world of artificial feudalism, all while refusing to recognize its rotten base for what it was. \n\nThe way America got over the Civil War was to say that the Confederacy was largely made of brave, valiant, clever, and at their roots honorable people, misguidedly fighting for the wrong cause. Robert E Lee personifies that. \n\nThe Confederacy was wrong, and was fighting for the wrong things, but it weren\'t pure evil. They mostly good people fighting for an emotionally motivated and irrational cause. The real lesson of the Civil War is this: all that blood and destruction and for what? At once both everything and nothing. The choice to resolve the question of slavery with bloodshed was an unnecessary one made by us, to the detriment of all.  \n\nI hold that holding people today personally responsible for history is fundamentally wrong and irrational on its face. The real takeaway from history is the moral responsibility not to repeat the same mistakes. That\'s the takeaway from the Holocaust: "never again". \n\nTrying to rewrite history, especially the ugly and morally complex parts is a desire to remain childish, to not understand, accept, and learn from the past. It is a childish and destructive impulse that must be opposed. '

If residents didn\'t like it, they should have taken it up with the council.\n\nAs pointless as it was, it was even more pointless for people to drive in from **outside the state** to protest it.  But, they got the permit for the protest and should have been allowed to do so peacefully.  Let them get it out of their system, then move on.  That\'s one of the purposes of the First Amendment:  let people have their moment to "speak", so they don\'t feel like they are being suppressed and have to resort to other means to get their point heard.\n\nInstead, the city tried to revoke the permit.  The ACLU stepped in to challenge it.  Then, they tried to move the protest to another park (which defeated the purpose of the protest).  The ACLU challenged that, too.  They got the injunction, and that should have been the end of it, once the protest was over.\n\nBut, the various leftist extremist groups got wind of it and started organizing a counter-protest.  They came prepared to do violence, just like they have done in the past.  The original protesters were aware of their plans, so they came prepared for violence, as well.\n\nAfter these two groups were herded into close proximity, violence predictably occurred.  The government declared a "state of emergency" (which they effectively created themselves) in order to shut it down.  But, only the original protestors were forced to honor the shutdown, while the police stood around and watched.\n\nThere are very few people in this cluster-f*** that have "clean hands".  But, the Misleadia and the left (yes, I repeated myself) are determined to weaponize it into propaganda.  Right now, it may appear to be working, but anyone that has seen uncensored video from last weekend can see the truth.\n\nIf there\'s one thing that I wish would be challenged more often, it\'s the claim that "hate speech" is "violence", and therefore justifies violence in return.  That\'s absolutely wrong, and it\'s practically settled law.   The ACLU fought this exact battle all the way to the Supreme Court back in 1977:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_Party_of_America_v._Village_of_Skokie\n\nSubsequent rulings have continued to narrow what constitutes "fighting words", i.e. speech that "inflicts injury or incites an immediate breach of the peace".  Public speech is protected by the First Amendment:  you can make speeches, wave a sign, whatever.  The line is drawn against **personal** threats:  i.e. you are in someone\'s face, threatening to kill or injure them.'
"If anyone gets to decided if the statue comes down, its only Charlottesville's people. not anyone else. not even the state at large. but they def want to destroy American history, ISIS style."
"On our side yes! There is so much we are fighting for, but on their side, it's a statue that pisses them off! Nothing means anything to them! They are fighting because they have been told to, and their feeling are hurt! We fight for Life, Liberty, and Justice for all! "

I don't think this has lost them any support, whilst is has certainly garnered them plenty of attention. Don't forget, people get pissy when people protest violently and it turns to riots; they ask, why don't they protest peacefully. Now they're protesting peacefully and people are still pissy. They're never going to be able to protest in a way that doesn't upset the other side. "

'\nThe decision to end DACA is a deserved end to a magnet for illegal immigration based on an unconstitutional executive order by Obama desperate for the minority vote. The Dreamer Act was completely rejected by Congress, it was never passable to begin with, it‚Äôs illegal as those who it claims to protect, though Obama took it upon himself to pass it by executive order soon after he said that he had [no authority](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/11/18/obamas-flip-flop-on-using-executive-action-on-illegal-immigration/utm_term=.1b328d080bc3impeachment).\n\nWhere were the calls for Obama‚Äôs calls for impeachment? \n\nSo firstly, President Trump is simply undoing an illegal action and reestablishing the rule of law. We are a nation of immigrants yes, but not illegal immigrants, and we are also a nation of upholding common and ordinary law which is found in every other nation on earth. People were brought to this country illegally because we failed to enforce these basic immigration laws, these people aren‚Äôt refugees, they aren‚Äôt asylum seekers and they aren‚Äôt children, all we are doing is trying to enforce our immigration laws which have always been there.\n\nAs a sovereign nation, just as every other, we have the right to decide who comes to the U.S. Even if we tripled our current legal immigration quotas, there would still be people who would enter or remain in the U.S illegally. Enforcing our immigration laws encourages people to come here legally, something we all support, and discourages illegal immigration, something we shouldn‚Äôt support.\n\nTo hear the media tell it, all 800,000 illegals being kept here by DACA are fantastic role models, they are the next Albert Einstein or someone on the verge of curing cancer and we Americans should be throwing ourselves at their knees in gratitude for them coming to stay with us. If your only understanding of this issue comes from the MSM, of course you are outraged over the fact that Trump is about to order an army to kick in daycare center doors, snatch up all the brown kids and hurl toddlers back over the southern border.\n\nIn reality, DACA is a shabby little temporary amnesty program created illegally for illegals. Let‚Äôs set the record straight to begin with. [We aren‚Äôt talking about children here,](https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca)the average age of Dreamers is 25 and many are as old as 35. They aren‚Äôt highly educated either. In August 2013, only[ 7.5 percent]( http://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-one-year-mark-profile-currently-eligible-youth-and?pdf=CIRbrief-DACAatOneYear.pdf)of the DACA illegals who were 18 or older had four-year college degrees. In August 2017, it dropped to only 5 percent. A significant share never event went beyond high school. The idea spread by the pro-illegal alien groups and the news media is that the DACA recipients are mostly inspiring, bright college kids, is a lie. \n\nThere‚Äôs also a little myth going around that 100 percent of DACA illegals have never broken the law. The truth is, over two thousand of them have lost their amnesty benefits due to [crime and gang violence,](\nhttp://www.washingtonexaminer.com/feds-30-surge-in-illegals-losing-daca-freedom-for-crimes-gang-violence/article/2632820) and just as they have become less educated year by year, rates of DACA participant crime and violence have rapidly accelerated every year since 2012. Bear in mind that the bar is very low for acceptance into the DACA program, explicitly allowing people with multiple offenses and certain felony convictions to be approved. Only a handful of the applicants were ever interviewed, and rarely was their information on application ever verified.\n\nSure, convicted murderers aren‚Äôt allowed entry into DACA, though if you have gun violations, you‚Äôve beat your wife and skinned a cat a couple of times, you‚Äôre in, as long as it‚Äôs only two cats as successful entrants can have up to [three misdemeanors]( i-821dinstr (2).pdf) regardless of severity, which is why virtually all applicants are accepted. So let‚Äôs do the math on how easy it is for anyone, no matter how little merit, to get into the DACA program that‚Äôs now being lauded by the media as ‚Äúthe best illegal immigration has to offer.‚Äù \n\nAccording to [official data](https://cis.org/Vaughan/High-DACA-Approval-Rate-Raises-Amnesty-Questions) from the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services, DACA has a rejection rate of just six percent, which means that means 94 percent of all applicants, no matter how gamy their paperwork, no matter what their misdemeanors or other ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù criminal activity is, and no matter how low-achieving or uneducated, all while being illegally here in the first place, have been gifted residency ahead of all legitimate immigrants who have waited in line, proven themselves to be highly qualified and educated, have proven their identity and have followed the law. One set of laws for them, one set for everyone else. This is the warped sense of equality which fails the left. \n\nIf your parents break into a stranger‚Äôs house and they tell you that this is your home now, it‚Äôs your right to live there and the police eventually come to kick you out, is it the homeowner‚Äôs fault when you are told to leave, or is it the fault of your parents for illegally entering the house in the first place and convincing you that it‚Äôs yours to stay in? The simple fact is, these adults are here illegally, and we can downplay it, lie about it and sugarcoat it all we want, the fact remains that they are here illegally, they are actively cheating the system and cheating both Americans and legal immigrants.\n\nAs I‚Äôve said before, illegal immigrants don‚Äôt do the work Americans don‚Äôt want to do, they do the work Americans won‚Äôt do for that price. When you flood the country with illegal workers by design and suppress wages to a point where only those willing to be exploited are willing to work for peanuts, unemployment becomes a big issue. The moment businesses are forced to raise wages without illegal workers, people will flock to these jobs and employment rates soar. This does not necessarily apply to all DACA illegals, though the principle remains, illegal workers are cheating Americans and legal immigrants job opportunities, especially with hiring quotas skewing the selection process.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to remember this decision on DACA does not mean these illegals now face the risk of deportation. DACA is a work permit program that offers those who came here illegally to take jobs that would otherwise go to Americans citizens, a fact that is getting lost in the outrage. Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúBuy American, Hire American‚Äù policies are extremely popular and with good reason, the only countries on earth who are told to be ashamed of putting themselves first and being patriotic are Western countries. Simply wanting to put our follow citizen first and follow standard immigration laws is today considered Nazism.\n\nThe outrage over DACA has only started, and in the coming days we are guaranteed to be inundated with claims Trump is going to tear eight year olds from their mothers‚Äô arm and the economy is about to collapse. My advice in the upcoming cacophony of cries and shrieks: don‚Äôt lose sight of the truth.\n\n'

'I hope Franken does stay. A Democrat would be appointed anyway and this gives more insulation to Trump against calls for his resignation over allegations.

"> Manchin was among the few Democrats who did not call for Franken‚Äôs resignation. The West Virginia senator stressed that he believes it would be appropriate for Franken to step down if the allegations are proved true.\n\nAt this point, Democrats are just raising people's blood pressure hoping their sheer stupidity cancels out the urge to rip them apart.

"If what he did was so bad that it required his resignation, then he should have resigned immediately.  None of this waiting a few weeks.  Either you resign immediately or you don't resign at all.  But if you are being forced out for misconduct, it should be instantaneous.  Any additional time spent in the Senate should be intolerable."
"As I said the whole thing was part of the Roy Moore smear campaign the dems needed a moral high ground and Franken was convenient scape goat. So if they fired him it would make the attacks on Moore look non partisan.. They fed the hyperbolic hysteria and wanted Moore to lose bad.. Now that he's lost there is no reason to pursue frankens resignation and also the public interest in the case has died down as predicted. "
"Let's make a deal. Since we have photographic evidence of him molesting a woman and that's not good enough to push for a resignation, then I don't want to hear another goddamn word about allegations of impropriety by our president. "
"This is honestly the most ridiculous/infuriating shit i've seen from politicians. I'm not saying sexual misconduct isn't a big deal, but it's been weaponized primarily to dispatch or defame political opponents. We live in a climate where the mere accusation (without proper evidence) can bring a man down, it appears to be a big factor in why Moore lost Alabama.\n\nAll of a sudden the left, who is losing big doners, congressmen and senators to scandals left and right are beginning to regret their ferocity in eliminating the accused from their own party. The most preachy, condescending assholes in government are backpedaling because out of control witch hunting has started to effect their potential presidential candidates.\n\nThe left, who has no apparent leader at this point aside from the extremely toxic and bitter Hillary Clinton has positioned themselves to be branded as the race and sex discrimination baiting platform in 2020, with social justice banshees like Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand screeching about the victims the whole way there.\n\nCan the left win on a victim-centric platform? Where the candidates run on extremely divisive issues painting everyone but a straight white male as a victim of the patriarchy?\n\nThe left is completely fucked and the only thing that will save them is a wholesale installation of a notion of injustice among minorities and women, There is no such thing as center-left anymore, you are either batshit crazy extreme left or you are a centrist just waiting for the Trump train to arrive. This is why the fake news media keeps exaggerating every story to highlight the racial aspects of it, you have to be transformed into a left-wing racist zealot in order to be compatible with today's progressive democrat."

The police in turn tell them how much it will cost for them to come out and perform arrest. Then they pay in advance for the arrests to happen. They then ensure press is there for coverage and boom - they\'re martyrs on their own terms.

Yes you are reading that correctly what sounds like total insanity was instituted as law by holder against our company .  Of course our company just happened to be the number one minority hiring engineering firm on the east coast- but we are private in a right to work state and so essentially the hit was to weaken the company to open access for more union jobs.  I asked my family what do we do go to the media no they said no one cares enough about these things and we also do government contracts so riding out the government would kill our ability to do business with them. So what do we do we go to court we fought it it and had the judge had it thrown out immediately as frivolous as insane- weaponized government corruption towards healthy companies full of good people of all races and genders- but the point is these people are going after you even if you're a good person even if you leading minority hiring if you aren't part of the group think structure they want to destroy good companies good families And they want to do it using pure racism disguises morality they have crossed the line it is when I realize that I had to vote it was red when I realize that there is an insane hyper focused on diversity over its value in reality to the point where it will be applied until it creates chaos these people do not care it is insanity and we must fight it and I will die fighting it if I have to. and they want to do it using pure racism disguises morality they have crossed the line it is when I realize that I had to vote it was written when I realize that there is an insane hyper focused on diversity over its value in reality to the point where it will be applied until it creates chaos these people do not care it is insanity and we must fight it and I will die fighting it if I have to."

The original protest walked into a trap. It was a very well conceived trap, and a very effective one.\n\nSpez: We also must not allow this to happen again. We must avoid organizing rallies/protests where the local government and/or police force will be used against us. We should organize in neutral areas if possible.

In response, I started to think of all of the times that some right-wing conservatard shot shot up a planned parenthood and et cetera, just like what the point of this thread is. It made me feel better for a moment, but then I remembered what mom used to say when I was 8 - two wrongs don\'t make a right. It was wrong to spill the blood of innocents when it wasn\'t one from "my team", and it was wrong when it was one of my team. And it was wrong yesterday.\n\nEquivocate all you want, but when one American spills the blood of another, it is wrong. It denotes that the train has completely gone off the tracks. It denotes that there are people in our parties that think this is a reasonable form of discourse. To devalue the lives of a person for something so trivial, it\'s not rational. It is psychotic.\n\nI hope that we can start to come together to recognize that we are Americans first, foremost and always. Parties are bullshit, we all just want to live. Maybe Scalice was shot but that doesn\'t excuse one more senseless act of violence.\n\n'

There are very few of these compared to the inverse. But that's all it takes just a couple to throw off everything we are trying to prove. \n\nI hate feeling so helpless.

NOTE:  Since 2011 illegal immigrants have been arrested for over 25 THOUSAND MURDERS.. \n\n[https://www.gao.gov/new.items/d11187.pdf](https://www.gao.gov/new.items/d11187.pdf)"

"Trump reinvigorated me aswell.  Not like I was going to kill myself or nothing, but I had resigned to cynicism.  After disastrous bush presidency followed by two terms of that grinning idiot Malik's lil bro, and watching conservative after conservative just give in to the media instantly,  then along came trump. \nBefore trump,  we were never even given a chance to fight.  Some conservative would say something,  media would demand an apology, and they'd cower and apologize before people could even express their support. Then the media would demand politician admonish their own base, and like a whipped dog,  they'd look into a camera and scold their own constituents.  for, in many cases, opinions no one even had, nor even had time to express had they even had them.       \n  I still remember the exact moment i knew trump wasnt fucking around.  It was glorious. "

They\'ve lost more credibility in the past year or so than during any other period in history. And now, Melania Trump is officially joining us in discarding them to the wind. This tweet from the President is now in the National Archives and hopefully Melania\'s approval of our distrust for the media will ignite a new beginning for journalism. '

"I am an American who lived in the UK for a year.  Watching their politics on TV I think I can explain.  The politics of outrage is huge in the UK.  We also have it in the US, but not as much.  I think because the Queen uses that fancy posh accent, the MP's in Parliament use the same accent, and it sounds more believable when you act outraged by things.  People assume you have a delicate sensibility if you have a delicate accent.  Any UK Pedes agree?"
"I find people want to outlaw speech they find offensive to be most offensive of all. Why do leftists get the final day in what is and is not offensive? I don't understand how it is people can't see the incredible danger of this kind of thinking. The slipperiest of slippery slopes."

Complaining about this is like complaining about Saudi Arabia's ban on women drivers. \n\nThese people are just following the law of their land. \n\nIf they didn't like living like this, they would've voted in someone to fix it ages ago."
"Same has happened in Canada because we don't have Freedom of Speech and neither does the UK which is why Gervais doesn't live there and goes to a great country like America and spews his vile hatred of Americans rights while using them to his advantage. He's a hypocrite"
'Criticize islam in the slightest way is seen as grossly offensive.\n\nYou will be convicted, sent to jail, and be murdered by the overwhelming number of muslims in that jail.\n\nUK you fucked up and it is disgusting.'

'If Democrats thought the wall was ineffective and a waste of money, why not trade it for DACA which they need for the literal survival of their party?

"I put on local talk show, host is going off on Trump demeaning those countries.

"It is the house bill, or no bill at all Mr. President.  No compromise on the house bill.  None.  If Dems don't accept the House bill, then ramp up deportations.  \n"
'Good, democrats only have themselves to blame and these cultural marxist "dreamers" have themselves to blame too. Their fucking cancer socialist politics and antics have made us say HELL TO THE NAW to DACA.'
"If they really thought the wall would be a disaster, why get in Trump's way?  On top of that, 1/4 of his base would evaporate over night if he touches DACA.\n\nI mean, realistically, how many people around here would be okay with DACA even IF Trump got everything he wanted- the wall, no chain migration, no lottery, additional ICE, and e-verify?  "
'The big meeting came and GEOTUS held their feet to the fire.  In response, Durbin acted like a whiney little middle-schooler.  Fuck the Democrats.'

'Stop negotiating and simply end DACA and begin deporting the illegal aliens hiding behind DACA. Democrats want them to stay simply for their vote. '
'FUCK THE COMMUNIST DEMOCRATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'
"The democrats need these illegals, so they can abuse the lack of voter ID to get them to vote for them.   This is a strategy, they don't care about illegals other than they vote for them.  If illegals voted republican they would be screaming about illegals taking the jobs of legal immigrants and nationals."
"It's really too bad that DACA has to be leveraged for National Security (I.E Immigration Reform and a Wall).  I'm for DACA personally, but it doesn't make sense to implement it without change to chain migration first.\n\nProper border security is obvious and has been something republicans and democrats together have ran on for decades.  We have extreme amounts of crime and drug use enabled by poorly secured borders, yet somehow it's bad?  What?\n\nAlso can we stop calling them Dreamers?  Liberals love to attach some sort of moral hierarchy to everything they want to implement.  Soon they'll call Felons Wishers or some stupid shit."

It's been confirmed she was kept drugged up by the Kenyan human trafficker - his dad - and forced to pose with one of his children to fool the US public into thinking he was one of us).\n\nChuck Schumer continues to enslave and control the entire state of NY - and no one blinks.\n\nTrump fixes one of THE most fucked up things Obama did to harm children and Trump needs to be impeached.\n\nLiberals want to live in a society where they are under a globalists boot while they are destroyed from the inside out.\n\nGlobalists have been taking pot shots at white Americans since we discovered Israel was seizing land from the Arabs (just Google USS Liberty). \n\nSince then, the fall of US society has been on overdrive.\n\nBut the real men has resisted these attempts. Held out until Trump showed up and gave us the tools and strength in to fight these blood suckers back.\n\nWe know who the globalists' generals are.

This maniac has threatened to turn all of the United States into ashes.  He knew Trump meant business and was about to lose his throne.\n\nTrump did great.  It\'s about time liberals and the media recognize this.   He also did directly condemn at first ALL hate (including terrorist hate, gay hate, racist hate, etc.).  Not good enough.

It\'s because Trump wasn\'t messing around.   \n\nWhy can\'t people freaking see this?'

'I feel like had any other country in the world had murdered an american citizen there would be hell to pay. NK sends us back an almost dead american and everones likes, "Stop being so mean to them and threatening violence!".\n\nLike are you shitting me?

'So you guys know:\n\n1. Hillary loses and cannot cover up super illegal Uranium One deal with own cabinet positions. Must have made a lot of people in govt a lot of money to find so many "helpers" in illicit activity. I believe this is much bigger than Clintons, I think this was a circle of a lot of people up to and including guys like McCain.\n2. Need to get "Russia" cover story in the public spotlight to send an "investigation" in to "investigate" the Russia issue.\n3. What better than to blame it on Trump? Let him take the heat while the FBI to go "look into this issue" Sounds dumb but public buys it!\n4. Trump unexpectedly fires Comey. Comey, Clinton, Obama, etc all panic and Comey does a very illegal thing to get a "Special Council" in there to keep cleaning up for the Clinton and Obama administrations (memo)\n5. Mueller is an old loyalist, he goes in to "investigate" Trump and Russia.\n6. They hire only loyalists since each of the people on the special council are going to find out what is really going on here. (Trump/Russia is a cover story)\n7. The FBI does what the FBI does in situations like this. They bring everybody in for questioning presenting "immunity" deals to turn over all evidence... and zip their mouths\n8. The second somebody gives them evidence, they hide it away, shred it, whatever\n9. Person who got immunity deal, cannot speak about it, doesn\'t want to speak about it because its a get out of jail free card (in a lot of cases) They are free and clear and nobody wants to shake that boat. Nicer to go home and be with their family\n10. Mueller quietly continues what Comey was doing on destroying evidence to cover up RICO issues with many people in the the federal government and Obama administration.\n11. The public is set off track thinking this has anything to do with Trump.\n\nYou guys know Trump/Russia is just a cover story for what is really going on... right? Its really about covering up the filthy shit they were all doing from the Clinton Foundation to McCabe\'s wife and the Obama administration. They were *all* getting down and dirty on this deal. The FBI and DoJ was covering for it. Something is *still* wrong with the FBI and DoJ! They are *still* covering for it! Also, the only reason Comey opened up the "investigation" into Hillary\'s emails last November is because Wikileaks was releasing info, the NYPD found an "Insurance File" on Weiner\'s Laptop... Comey literally freaked out and started trying to play dumb thinking the whole house of cards was coming down. (everybody for themselves) When Wikileaks and NYPD info didn\'t leak anything he didn\'t know how to explain, he went back to "nothing to see here folks! move along!"'

But fear not, I will protect you. I have chosen a republican Congressman that the left vehemently hates to demand you step down based on your withholding of information and evidence regarding the Russian uranium investigation during the Obama administration. \n\nThey are going to eat it up. CNN will tell them that we are panicking. They\'ll say that we are obstructing justice, running scared. They\'ll *know* this is the end for me.

"From breitbart \n\n\nGaetz said that when he asked Sessions to appoint a special counsel to investigate the 2010 Uranium One deal and Fusion GPS, the attorney general stood up, said he could not discuss the matter because he had recused himself, and walked out of the room, leaving them with a group of Rosenstein staffers ‚Äúwho showed no interest.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHe said that anything that had to do with 2016 election, or Russia, or the candidates in the 2016 election, fell under the scope of his recusal, and he left the room,‚Äù Gaetz said.\n\nSo If we are applying the same logic, either sessions shall unrecuse or mueller shall recuse. \n\nBut  first light the fire under podesta's ass"
'Resolution, hell. How about a law?'
'Unfortunately firing Mueller would be a disaster and make impeachment more probable'
'INB4 "These things take time. Be patient." \n\nIt\'s hard to reconcile that with the speed with which Mueller was appointed. I think that\'s the key frustration that many of the over-optimists don\'t understand. Why didn\'t the Dems have to be patient? With Republicans in power, no less. Then Sessions says we don\'t target our political opponents, all while this Mueller witch hunt is staring him in the face. No precedent for targeting an outgoing administration, huh? What about an incoming one?\n\nIt looks as if their goal is to bumrush through the Mueller thing on manufactured grounds and worry about the corruption loose ends and brazen double standards later, when anything about Obama and the Clintons can be stonewalled and made to fizzle into nothing. The GOP hasn\'t received anything close to enough heat over this. It should be priority #1 on this sub. \n\nAs for the Sessions hearing today, PM me your best nudes if this prediction turns out to be correct: It will be Sessions further reinforcing the frame of defense, defense, defense... with no signs of any legal counterattack whatsoever. My fap bin is empty and waiting. \n\n**Update:** So the DOJ apparently isn\'t in the business of revealing the existence of an investigation. I seem to remember some guy named Comey seeking permission from the DOJ to reveal the existence of a Russian-collusion investigation against the Trump administration, something he dropped during a highly anticipated Congressional opening statement. Funny how that works out. I guess an investigation *can* be revealed if it benefits Democrats for months in the media. Why do I get the feeling there\'s no investigation whatsoever and Sessions is simply hiding behind muh DOJ protocolz? '

"I think coming into this Trump and Sessions were at a disadvantage because it would have looked like a political vendetta against these people but by holding out and letting proof of corruption leak out by other means in combination with tweets like this, I think Trump is trying to drum up enough public outcry that when Sessions does something he'll be doing it on the will of the people."
'It is so irritating seeing the clown comments pushed to the top, seeing those sad liberals all over his tweets'
'Why does he have go on Twitter and ask ‚ÄúWhere is the Justice Dept‚Äù He is the damn President. Why doesn‚Äôt he summon the heads of the Justice Dept to his office and tell them to either deal with this or be fired. Sounds like Rosenstein might need to resign now anyway since he is up to his neck in the Uranium One deal corruption. Enough with the stupid Twitter.

'Made me log onto twitter to see what I thought you would send me.  You owe me!\nThe Tweet simply asks a question. It doesn\'t state a fact. It doesn\'t question Sessions performance.\nYou can interpret it the way you want, but this does not constitute Trump stating his displeasure with Sessions performance.\nYou still haven\'t shown me proof.\nHaving followed Trump for more than thirty years. Reading his books and understanding his strategic thinking, I think this is being played the only way it can be.  I really have no opinion one way or the other on Sessions presently. If I\'m right, Trump is strategically manipulating events via Twitter and public statements in order to set the stage. This is all about timing and momentum and if they go too soon, they never get another chance. Making it "appear" perhaps that Sessions is a reluctant warrior in the fight against Clinton Inc. is more than likely part of Trumps overall strategy, but of course you know that.....right?\nWhat is gained by announcing your intentions.?What is gained telling your enemy what you have on them before you know you have a kill shot?\nIn the end, \nOne of us will be right on this, but if I\'m right.....we both win.

'Muhammad resigns as prophet amid sexual assault allegations\n\nOn the heels of this week\'s resignation of Karl Marx as leading figure in the communist movement due to allegations of sexual misconduct, the triggered social justice organizers of the #MeToo collective have claimed the scalp of another progressive icon.\n\nAt a press conference, supported by her family and lawyers, a woman named Aisha claimed that she was taken as a bride by Mr. Muhammad when she was nine years old. When asked why it took so long for her to come out, she stated that she feared nobody would believe her since the testimony of a woman is not worth a lot in her social circle. The crying woman also confessed that Mr. Muhammad used to beat her when she displeased him, and she feared physical retribution.\n\nMr. Beelzebub, the lawyer representing the accused prophet, denied the gravity of the accusations, saying that "everyone was doing it at the time," and that his client "did not remember the situation in quite the same way."\n\nBut later that day more stories emerged from other victims, encouraged by Aisha\'s testimony and resulting in the viral #MuhammadToo campaign on Twitter.\n\nThe first ones to come out were members of a Muslim Boy Scout group, who claimed that Mr. Muhammad ordered their fathers to beat them if they refused to pray. They were followed by a slave girl who was a victim of sex trafficking and claimed that the Prophet of Islam was present while she was being gang-raped shortly after his companions captured her and turned her into a sex slave.\n\nThese revelations led the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, the prestigious Islamic university in Cairo, to issue a statement, calling on Mr. Muhammad to step aside. "I\'ve struggled with this decision because he\'s been a good Prophet, and I consider him a friend," the statement said. "But that cannot excuse his behavior and his mistreatment of women."\n\nReacting to pressure from colleagues and the media, Mr. Muhammad called a press conference and declared that after a good deal of soul-searching and consulting with his family members and lawyers, he finally made the tough decision to step down as prophet - a move that many in the Muslim community saw as a shock, followed by a sudden sense of relief.\n\nThe first world leader to respond was the Grand Ayatollah Khamenei of Iran. "I consider Mr. Muhammad a dear friend and respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his believers," Mr. Khamenei said in a short statement. "Now that his legacy is tainted beyond repair, I call for the immediate dissolution of Islam as an ideology and a political movement. We are making preparations to convert the Islamic Republic of Iran back to Zoroastrianism immediately. Praise Zarathustra."\n\nWorldwide, Muslims are now discovering further evidence of Mr. Muhammad\'s past misdeeds in the Islamic holy texts, which has remained overlooked for 14 centuries, despite having been reproduced in millions of copies, written or printed in black ink on white paper.\n\n"If only I had known!" cried King Salman of Saudi Arabia, who spoke on behalf of the world\'s majority of Muslims. "Now that I\'m reading the Quran more thoroughly, I\'m suddenly finding all kinds of sexual misconduct and other improper behavior. All this talk about killing apostates, terrorism, and torture. Who could have guessed? He seemed like such a nice gentleman."\n\nKing Salman has not yet made a decision on what new replacement religion he will impose on his country, but insiders have indicated he is "showing an interest in Judaism."\n\nPeople in the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank celebrated the resignation today by dancing in the streets and passing out candy to children. Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, insisted that from now on he wanted to be known only as "Mr. Mo" and described the new faith of his people as "officially atheist."\n\nWith no more reason for strife and jihad to continue, Mr. Mo set up a telephone call with Israel\'s PM Benjamin Netanyahu, proposing to start negotiations about the incorporation of the territories previously controlled by the PLO and HAMAS into the state of Israel. "Because after all," the PLO leader explained, "their army has hotter chicks."\n\nLinda Sarsour was seen entering a nunnery. According to inside sources, she will henceforth be known as "Sister Linda of the Sacred Heart." The abbess declined an interview, saying only that "Sister Linda has taken a vow of silence, to atone for her sins. Leave her alone. She has suffered enough."\n\nThe website The Religion of Peace, known to keep track of jihad terror worldwide, has acknowledged a complete lack of new material since Mr. Muhammad\'s resignation and announced that it will probably have to shut down. "The world seems to have suddenly become a less violent and a much safer place," their editorial stated, asking readers to contact them if they find a reasonable explanation for this phenomenon.\n\nManufacturers of real news, CNN and BBC, were quick to point out that this newfound tranquility should not make us jump to conclusions, stressing that "world peace has nothing to do with the disappearance of Islam, and saying otherwise makes one a bigoted racist or maybe even a Trump supporter."'

'I was just searching for "I\'ll have those nigg**s voting Democrat for 200 years" by Big Dick Johnson and came across the Snopes article, thought I\'d see how they spun it. I was actually brutally shocked, and that\'s not easy after all these years on the internet. \n\n> For example, he reportedly referred to the Civil Rights Act of 1957 as the ‚Äúnigger bill‚Äù in more than one private phone conversation with Senate colleagues. And he reportedly said upon appointing African-American judge Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court, ‚ÄúSon, when I appoint a nigger to the court, I want everyone to know he‚Äôs a nigger.‚Äù\n\nAccording to a historian, this quotation is accurate: \n\n>     These Negroes, they‚Äôre getting pretty uppity these days and that‚Äôs a problem for us since they‚Äôve got something now they never had before, the political pull to back up their uppityness. Now we‚Äôve got to do something about this, we‚Äôve got to give them a little something, just enough to quiet them down, not enough to make a difference. For if we don‚Äôt move at all, then their allies will line up against us and there‚Äôll be no way of stopping them, we‚Äôll lose the filibuster and there‚Äôll be no way of putting a brake on all sorts of wild legislation. It‚Äôll be Reconstruction all over again.\n\nAnd it gets worse: \n\n>     As long as you are black, and you‚Äôre gonna be black till the day you die, no one‚Äôs gonna call you by your goddamn name. So no matter what you are called, nigger, you just let it roll off your back like water, and you‚Äôll make it. Just pretend you‚Äôre a goddamn piece of furniture.\n\n\n'
"without a doubt. they want to destabilize the US and create civil war, and they want to do it very quickly. they lost control of the american people last november, and now they're losing control of the narrative. none of these **exact same fucking tactics** worked leading up to the election, so why do they expect them to work *now* with Trump at the helm? but they're doubling down every day, further exposing the link between the left, ISIS, CNN, and antifags, so whatever, it's actually starting to work to our advantage because *normal every day democrats/republicans/people aren't as violent as the left & television say they are*.\n\nthey've been working towards this for a long time, and managed to successfully highjack the US government in 1913. if anon5 is to be believed, they operate in 100 year plans, and the current 100 year plan started in 1918. president trump is in serious danger. the people that run the planet from behind the curtain want him dead. and when CNN is literally funded and operated by the same group of shadow scum that are trying to kill our president, it's so easy for them to cover up EVERYTHING and maintain their *bulletproof* credibility in the eyes of the public.\n\nthis is *how bad* the foreign involvement in our government has become. when it's literally almost *impossible* to expose any of these fucking criminals out of fear of outright civil war.\n\nit's so bad."

'These two statues are unrelated. The Bull statue was placed there after the stock market crash to symbolize the tenacity of the American people. The girl statue was placed there later and has no real meaning.

Conservative women can believe in their own empowerment, be considered feminist just for that, and still not believe in all the other man-hating bullshit the left throws in.\n\nHere\'s a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmhFLUesQBs) of Marion Le Pen showcasing what **I** consider feminism by calling out leftists\' idea of feminism.'

He\'s been held accountable **never** because of a mix of sympathy an equal opportunity, and he has a platform and money that far exceeds his intelligence or deserved level ... he was basically "abducted" (for lack of a better word) by a keen eyed jihadi female, who realized he was a living embodiment of Forrest Gump with a nationally televised audience. He was the blank retarded voice to the public she needed as a host. \n\nAnd now he\'s an angry simpleton, because he let this jihadi break his gravy train. He\'s too dumb to realize why.

'The NFL used to be a uniquely American sport highlighting team competition and combat.\n\nNow it‚Äôs about these things:\n\n1) Money (obviously)\n2) Political statements \n3) Fantasy teams\n4) CTE\n5) International expansion\n6) High correlation with domestic violence \n\nAnd frankly, all that might be overlooked (since it‚Äôs sadly common across most sports today), but those things in conjunction with the severely diminished on-the-field product...\n\n5) Painfully slow pace-of-play\n6) 12 minutes of actual gameplay over 3+ hours\n7) Penalties for hits that are ‚Äútoo violent, ‚Äù essentially legislating defense out of the game\n8) Endless commercial breaks\n9) Moving kickoffs closer up to effectively deter exciting returns\n10) Painfully slow (and frequent) replay\n\n...it‚Äôs just all contributing to the inevitable decline of football in America. \n\nOddly enough, the NFL is in the worst possible position, from a PR perspective. Liberals and leftists already despise football (for reasons that should be obvious, from their perspective: toxic masculinity, causes irreversible brain trauma, perpetuates the ideas of slavery -white owners and black players, and of course, it‚Äôs about competition, winners, and losers...which leftists abhor). These people will never become fans. In fact, they‚Äôre the very people (smug, Oregon, latte-sipping, hybrid-driving SJWs, for example) who are going to inevitably succeed in getting football banned from public high schools because science says it damages childrens‚Äô brains. \n\nSo all the BLM, Kaepernick, anti-Trump protests in the world aren‚Äôt going to create good will toward the NFL from these people.\n\nThe people who are NFL fans are (and always have been) blue collar workers, cops, firemen, independent thinkers, Classic Americans who appreciate greatness, victory, defeat, competition, toughness....and these are the people who are now saying the hell with the NFL. If THESE fans leave (and they are), the NFL is finished. \n\nThe NFL is currently pandering to whiners who will never like them at the expense of alienating the only base of fans they‚Äôll ever have. It‚Äôs doomed to end in disaster. The NFL will be a shadow of its former glory within 10 years.\n\nThe most hilariously out-of-touch thing the NFL did this year was actively promote the fact that they‚Äôre allowing scoring celebrations. If there was ever an equivalent of putting lipstick on a pig, that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs like someone said, ‚ÄúDamn Roger, we‚Äôre taking a lot of heat and our league has gotten so serious in so many different areas. I know! Rather than deal with our issues, let‚Äôs encourage players to make asses out of themselves with silly touchdown dances. That should buy us some time and make our idiot fans stop calling us the No Fun League.‚Äù\n\n\n'

'Nah, he started dating a crazy bitch from Berkeley.'
'So wait... maybe he is the whole "White privilege" thing the left keeps hammering about... he got to where he is because he was just given things instead of earning them.\n\nAlso, it pains me to say this but a black man leaving before the kid is born is the "norm" for some reason. I was there for my kids and my kids better damn well be there for theirs when they have them otherwise there will be hell to pay.'
'Yea he‚Äôs a retard.   Plus he sucks!   Garbage player '
"Wellpppp that explains that.... Privileged a-hole. He had more white privileges than  me (white chick) so he spits on it then whines that life isn't fair? Eyeroll......  His protest is a joke. Plus I never understood why kneeling instead or respecting the flag was a thing against st white people. Last time I checked, Americans came in several different colors (and now, according to some, at least three genders) so WTF was his damn point anyway? "
'What the fuck I hate not being born to drug-addicted parents and getting shot at in Chicago every night!'
'he probably has had childhood trauma from his parents....or maybe he just always hated them because he feels like they "stole" him from his real parents. Who the fuck knows.....but it is obvious he hates America and white Americans. '
"Damn right, fuck the NFL and their unpatriotic cunts who are only there BECAUSE of Americans.\n\nRemember the phrase NFL owners: You're only as strong as your weakest link. Those who take the knee to our nation's anthem? Weakest fucking links.\n"
'He is human garbage. Many NFL players are. Racists, criminals, etc. It shouldn‚Äôt have taken this long for people to start tuning out. '
'I don\'t know that he hates white people, he\'s just a narcissist.  \n\nHis career timeline is basically:\n\n* Took over a stacked team, and had about the same record as the previous QB (Alex Smith)\n\n* Became a social media jackass: argued with fans on Instagram, wore a Dolphins hat during an offseason because "it\'s just swag", and tweeted to Houston that "I warned you the 7torms coming" with a pic of the floods they had in 2015.  That last one earned him the hashtag of "7tupid".  \n\n* He then had a shitty playoff performance on a team that still almost made the superbowl and then went 10-16 over the following 2 seasons. \n\n* By 2016 he was disliked by his hometown fans.  He was booed by 49er fans when first taking the field in the 2016 preseason...this was before the protest was news.   It\'s at that point where he became "socially conscious", which raises the question of whether it\'s genuine or just a way for a narcissist to keep in the limelight with a career on the steep decline.

Swallwell is even using an unrelated platform to preach. Luckily he got put in his place very quickly. \n\nThey seriously act like this is Pres. Trumps policy and it‚Äôs never happened before. \nAnd the sad part is, most liberals actually believe it. \n\nHere‚Äôs a crazy idea, if you don‚Äôt want to be separated from your children:\n1) don‚Äôt commit a crime that will separate you. (This isn‚Äôt some new policy, it happens to Americans every day)\n2) don‚Äôt give your kids to a complete stranger on a fatally dangerous trek. \n\nEdit:\nAlso 2014-2015(Obama‚Äôs presidency)\nThere were laws saying that you must separate the children from the parents and they cannot be held in confinement, because it‚Äôs immoral. \nNow they are recanting those cries to the opposite. \nEven more proof of the hypocrisy of the left and that they are in fact just making fuss. Because, well, that‚Äôs all the Left seems to do. '

Travel to NoKo is banned for Americans (same as we had with Cuba).  And that includes you, Dennis Rodman, you weirdo.  If you break this law, we will not come rescue your dumb face.  We will not send American people to barter for your release with American treasure. We will pray for you, but we will not risk American lives because you are irresponsible.   Keeping our people away eliminates bargaining chips for Rocket Man and it lets us negotiate harder at the table.  Enough of a nanny state enabling risky and moronic behavior from grown American citizens.  Enough millennials and SJWs running around overseas, acting a fool, getting arrested, and begging Uncle Sam to save them from the meanies.  "

'Yeah he was a prisoner for something as minor as stealing a propaganda banner but why did the autopsy report (the family chose to not have anything invasive) conclude that Ottos teeth werent rearranged and pretty much evrrything that the parents said NK did to him the autopsy couldnt find proof of?\n\n\nIm not trying to provoke im seriously wondering. Ive followed Otto since he was first arrested and after reading the autopsy report someone is clearly lying. No doubt, Otto didnt deserve to die as young as he did but like what is up with the official story?'
'Hell at this point I‚Äôd be happy to trade our shit media with North Korean citizens. Get em out of that shit situation.'
"Then don't have sympathy for the father, have sympathy for the children who didn't choose to have their father stolen from them."

They aren't supporting their politics, or anything about them. It is a puff piece. I don't know why people are crying about it being offensive. It is people on the right being snowflakes. "
'What is stupid about hating a country that starves its citizens?'
'3 hostages? Don\'t forget the hundreds of thousands of North Korean citizens that are held in Gulags/Concentration Camps as political prisoners. Don\'t forget the international assassinations NK agents are known for. Don\'t forget the attack on South Korean citizens at 2010, the torpedoing of a SK ship in 2010. Finally don\'t forget the forget the American citizens that are subjected to the brutaility of the North Korean regime. The tragedy of Otto Warmbier will only be repeated if the truth is not put out by the main stream media\n\nIt\'s so bizarre how you think participating at part of one team can be considered good despite the evil NK is known for. It\'s like saying Nazi Germany is not so bad if they did some "happy fun shit" during the Olympics. President Trump is one of the few leaders who can recognize how much of a threat NK is to global peace and security '
'There are a lot of people who go to North Korea as a tourist and/or study abroad. There are a couple hundred US citizens each year who travel to North Korea so it‚Äôs almost inevitable that out of those hundreds one will be detained. In North Korea you need to remember that there are no rights. When you try to leave the country after your stay, you have to make it back through customs at the airport; this is where most people get locked up. The regime can decide to lock you up for any reason they choose at the airport, it may even be that you made the guards mad. In the case of Otto it was because they found a propaganda poster in his backpack during routine searches. A great YouTuber who illegally snuck into North Korea to get video [made a documentary](https://youtu.be/dgmZR-F1XIU) and was nearly detained at the airport because he had professional camera equipment making him appear as a member of the press. I suggest you watch that whole documentary, it talks about the corruption in the media allowing North Korean propaganda to spread in order to make profits. '

I see no end in sight when it comes to tragedies like someone wanting to kill as many people as possible. When it does end, i think it will be at a great cost to all of mankind.'
'"Why charges against Andrew McCabe is bad for Donald Trump." - CNN'
'He better not fly around Hawaii, emergency land in the water, get out safely, float around in the water just fine with his bros, then die suddenly of a heart attack because you were scared by a scuba diver that came outta nowhere with a heart attack serum and stabs you.'
'The audacity of McCabe‚Äôs attorney to basically concede he lied to Congress/IG, however he won‚Äôt be prosecuted unless there‚Äôs inappropriate pressure from administration. McCabe was the one over seeing Flynn‚Äôs lying to the FBI charge.'
"Yeah. and those of us who have literally been screaming that the whole narrative was a lie are left angry and high and dry. It makes me so mad. I'm so mad I can't even function. I mean, just today my mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets, and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I‚Äôm so distressed right now I don‚Äôt know what to do. I didn‚Äôt mean to do that to my mom but I‚Äôm literally in shock from the lack of muh Russia. I feel like I‚Äôm going to explode. "
"The worst part is that every narrative they throw out is a projection of what they actually do. It's so sick and twisted to behold."
'It‚Äôll be back. Now that The Don has opened the eyes of the silent majority to the violent alt-left and antifa, this racism narrative won‚Äôt last. '
'Don‚Äôt worry Putin as soon as DOJ start jailing some of the ‚ÄúProtesters‚Äù *Antifa* that will bring up Russia again to distract people.'
"The left like to call themselves progressive, but they are just regressive reactionists.  They literally coined the term progressive, so that anyone who is not them, must be seen as the opposite of progress.  That's how full of themselves they are, that's the core of their manipulation.  The left are the type of people that think the clothes make the man rather than actions.  The left are the morally bankrupt, that believe they are nothing but virtue.\n\nAs history has shown, leftist views only ever lead to totalitarianism, and totalitarianism always leads to fascism.  we're raised to believe fascism is synonymous with leaning right, but that's just another manipulation so that the left can further distance itself from the reality of what it truly is.  "
"They're prepping for the 2018 elections. Collusion didn't get them enough momentum to impeach, so now they're trying to get anyone to the right of center labeled as a domestic terrorist.\n Silence the right by making everyone to be an nazi that isn't on the left.

'Poor Putin has become the forgotten man.'
"Of course that's the final link in how Russia hacked the election. Putin convinced a white nationalist within the DNC to steal some emails then Putin convinced everyone that it was Russia that hacked the election. Putin then hacked into Clinton's campaign files and deleted planed rallies from her schedule. Putin then attacked Trump tower network to pin the collusion on him. Putin then proceeded to hack into Soros's financial servers and hired professional agitators to attack Trump rallies. Putin then proceeded to further undermine our democracy by Denying he did anything at all. Putin even came to California and voted for Clinton several times. "
"Yup.  He's not the only one to say it- Marilyn Manson has absolutely come to the same conclusion.\n\n>...that's not the way the media wants to take it and spin it, and turn it into fear, because then you're watching television, you're watching the news, you're being pumped full of fear, there's floods, there's AIDS, there's murder, cut to commercial, buy the Acura, buy the Colgate, if you have bad breath they're not going to talk to you, if you have pimples, the girl's not going to fuck you, and it's just this campaign of fear, and consumption, and that's what I think it's all based on, the whole idea of 'keep everyone afraid, and they'll consume.\n\n(Granted he tried to blame rapin' Bill for Columbine but most of it aged well)\n\nSpez: I'm a dumb-ass.

There was *sooooo* much that was arguing for it to be a leaker and everyone kept touching themselves to some claim of evidence like the Trump dossier (which the author later came out and admitted to not having verified anything before sending out).\n\n\nWe put up with that shit for over a year and I want Democrats to be utterly destroyed come 2018. I want each Republican running against them to smack the shit out of them by talking about how much time and money was wasted on chasing a myth and how dishonest their party is. I want to see the freaking Democratic party burn to the ground. It seriously is annoying.'

'The [**Behringer music equipment company**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behringer) started off as a German firm building semi-quality music gear with imported Chinese parts, and now makes its products in China.\n\n\n\n\n\\>Inside scoop: Uli Behringer had to move to China to directly supervise manufacturing, due to quality control issues leading to a large number of "Dead In The Box" products (brand-new items delivered not working.)  \n\n\n\n\nBehringer\'s business model is typical Chinese copycatting: lots of barely-disguised copies of high-dollar products, at drastically lower prices than the "real thing." In some cases, this involves direct bootlegging of intellectual property (and lawsuits with Mackie, Aphex, Roland, Peavey, BBE, dbx, Drawmer, etc etc.) There have also been safety concerns, as far as UL/CE safety testing. \n\n\n\n\nExample: Peavey\'s XXX-2 guitar amp was originally designed for Joe Satriani (at the time, it was called the JSX.) A very high-quality durable piece of gear, as one would assume- considering Satriani used this amp for touring. The Behringer knock-off is called a "333" and is as close a copy as they can manage for 1/3rd the price. But... it\'s also 1/3rd the quality and durability. The early models failed due to cost-cutting measures that looked good on paper, not so good when the high voltage was applied and things went dead, or caught fire. But this is a case of getting what you pay for, in terms of dealing with a company that uses its customers as beta testers/quality control inspectors.     \n\n\n\n\nSupposedly, their "quality" control is better now (I\'ll have to take their word for it, I\'ve seen enough DIB/gear failures from them that I 100% avoid their stuff.)\n\n\n\n\nObviously, the Chinese manufacturing "standards" have a lot to do with their low prices (plus the direct copying of other manufacturer\'s products saves time/money on research & development.) But I wonder if they are also taking advantage of this lopsided tariff scam to (unfairly) keep prices down. \n\n'

O\'Keefe has exposed the bias and everyone knows anyway.   But a lot of people like that bias.   Yes, GEOTUS is doing his part.

I'm usually not for that type of shit at all but the fact that this guy is busted red handed trying to fuck children and he gets off that easy just angers me.

I don't think he identifies as a lady but even he did, what does Left have against ladies and why are they suggesting it is a negative?\n* breasts - implying Trump has breasts? Well he is 71 years old and probably has some saggy skin and fat, just like 99.999% of men 71 years or older. What does Left have against old men?\n* duck - Trump must be an animal hater yelling at that duck. Well, sometimes ducks are jerks. so what?\n\nI mean I just don't get this.

'Yeah. I thought the same thing. I guess the left is too preoccupied with hating all things Trump that they forgot.. some shit is just funny. '
"Thing is that we are on the right side of all of the things in the universe, we are healthy mentally, and we have a great sense of humor.\n\nLeftists, on the other hand, have no sense of humor whatsoever hence they are unable to laugh at themselves thus they only get triggered and http://i.imgur.com/TLDhPvH.jpg, but mainly they get so upset because all of memes, caricatures, criticism, etc. directed at them only expose truth about them which isn't pleasant since they are on the wrong side of all of the things in the universe and the cognitive dissonance in their heads makes them hurt physically which is driving them into complete insanity.\n\n"
'This is similar to the mini Trump. The idea is to attack his masculinity. And that shows just how far off the mark the Left is, that they think people like Trump because he\'s "macho"? Or maybe they\'re projecting their resentment about being physically weak themselves.'
"The opportunistic misuse of the word Nazi is merely the newest iteration of the lefts complete reliance on mischaracterization and subsequent shaming. That's something Alinsky and his acolytes sought to instill in the left, and its a kind of viral narcissistic. You use and manipulate people to use and manipulate others, probably after having been used and manipulated yourself. \n\nThe only thing holding the left together at this point is a highly interconnected network of narcissistic supply and demand. They are all just wrapped in each other spider webs, willfully and desperately blind to the horrors of living like that. It's no wonder they defend and try to advance their ideology at this point. It's all based on a fantasy, the fantasy of what they wanted the left to be. Hell is too scary so they look down at the road to good intentions and follow it further into the fire. \n\nEven if the left wanted to do something different, what options are available to them. They can't be right on the arguments because they are wrong. Every argument they do make is so obviously manipulative and dishonest that they don't know how to make a good argument or even a good faith effort. They are so raw from the constant but subtle threat of bullying that they simply crack when dealing with any from of direct confrontation. You might think that they could just admit they are wrong at this point, but they can't. \n\nThe minds of the left has been subjugated by the tyranny of their own ideologies. \n\nThat's what you point out when when you argue with a leftist. That's why so many can get so angry. That's why the ones that are able to hold the anger at bay struggle even in the more productive conversations. If you can make them think you are being reasonable, even for a moment, you are challenging a part of their minds that simply can't tolerate being challenged. It's not your challenge that distresses them so, it's that they thought you might be reasonable. \n\nBy constantly using the tactics of misrepresentation and vilification, that's become how the left thinks. That's how they think about themselves. They simply can't be open the person they are trying to call racist without being called a racist themselves by themselves. They have to defend against that so they make the only argument they know how, a manipulative and dishonest one. They have to. Otherwise they are a racist, or whatever. They also have to beleive it, or at least play dumb about what they are doing, for the same reasons. \n\nAny liberals reading this, I know that we use terms like enemy and opponent and I think you're a threat to all I hold dear, but I think most of you are victims of some very malignant people and some very destructive ideas. I think you are hurting and I think you all hate what you've become and hate living like that. I think you tell us it's all great and that everyone should live that way forever because to not think that would be to acknowlege the fears and doubts you have. \n\nLet that House of cards fall. It's built on a slippery slope and if you think it's bad now, think of were we were 15 years ago. Think of were we will be in another 15 if you win. "

"Thank you. I like how you said that in your last senThat's why we have to take the high ground. We don't need to win arguments. What will that do? They will just claim victory anyway. We need to be reasonable. Where else will they learn how?\n\nThat's not to say that we shouldn't argue to try to do so well, just the opposite. The best thing we can do is challenge them, expose them to themselves and expose them to a different way of thinking. We can win arguments too, but it's not the point. America isn't struggling because there aren't good arguments. America is struggling because of a power centric and dishonest culture where good arguments don't matter. If the problem is that they dismiss our arguments by vilifying us, we need to challenge the vilification directly and act in ways that don't exacerbate the problem. \n\nI know I'm just ranting at this point, but if the left are part of an unhealthy culture I think the best thing we can do is build up a healthy culture as an alternative and point out how unhealthy they are being. I know a lot of people here want to take a more combative approach, and I think there's a place for that, but we should take great care to remember what we are fighting for. We should also take great care not to hold up the liberal medias idea of Trump as are exemplar. He's got a personality but he's a good man who takes the high road when possible. Trump is a pragmatist. The left has made pragmatism and morality mutually exclusive. They are not and we must be both moral and practical to MAGA. "

Note to fellow conservatives: be on the look out for left wing psyops designed to cuck us into helping their narrative. The word "alt-right" is a left wing psyop. Don\'t use it. You\'re not a neo-con. You\'re not alt-right either. You\'re just a guy who doesn\'t want children transgendered by their parents, and grown men in the ladies room, while phony Russia collusion stories fill up the news. '

'Many of the Founding Fathers didn\'t make it through the war. They were the 1% and they gave up all their power and prestige to fight for the rights of farmers and craftsmen. This is a little rundown of *some* of those sacrifices:\n\nWilliam Ellery, Rhode Island: His house and entire estate was burned to the ground. He survived the war and later became a vocal opponent of slavery.\n\nWilliam Floyd, New York: He and his family escaped the British invasion of Long Island to Connecticut, but left behind their home and his entire income. The home was a charred ruin when they returned, penniless, a full 7 years later. He went on to become a U.S. Senator and Congressman from New York.\n\nFrancis Lewis, New York: His home and estates on Long Island were destroyed by the British. Even worse, Mrs. Lewis was captured and imprisoned, dying from complications stemming from her incarceration.\n\nLewis Morris, New York: Far from being a "courteous abstainer" during the debate (as the musical 1776 tells us), Morris literally put his money where his mouth (and signatures) was; the entire Morris financial fortune was put at the service of the Continental Army. Loyalist neighbors confiscated his property, forcing him apart from his family for the duration of the war. His brother Gouverneur (of Constitution fame) also lost most of his wealth during the Revolution.\n\nPhillip Livingston, New York: One of the wealthiest men in American in 1776, Livingston lost every shilling he had as a result of signing the Declaration. His family was driven from their house by the British and his estate plundered. Livingston died impoverished just two years later, while still serving in the Continental Congress.\n\nJohn Hart, New Jersey: Hart\'s wife was dying as he signed the Declaration. He hurried home in time to say goodbye, only to be forced to flee as the British approached. His 13 children never saw their father again: they were all forced to flee for their lives as well. He died in 1779.\n\nRichard Stockton, New Jersey: Judge Stockton was arrested by the British in 1776 and imprisoned in a military stockade. He was released 5 years later, his health crippled, and died a pauper in Princeton. Richard Stockton College in New Jersey is named in his honor.\n\nJohn Witherspoon, New Jersey: A native of Scotland, he earned his Doctorate in Divinity from the University of St. Andrews before immigrating to the colonies to serve as President of the College of New Jersey (better known today as Princeton University). The British responded to his signing the Declaration by burning the College library to the ground when they occupied Princeton a few months later, and pillaged the rest of the campus. Witherspoon returned after the British were expelled from the area by the Continental Army, and lived to see the College rebuilt.\n\nRobert Morris, Pennsylvania: Morris earned a massive fortune as a banker and commercial magnate - and gave it all away to finance the Revolution. The "blockade runners" that brought provisions from Europe to the colonies were entirely paid for and provisioned by Morris. He also loaned the then-enormous sum of $10,000 to the Continental Congress when it was on the verge of bankruptcy in 1776. Unlike the global bankers of today, Morris didn\'t set any preconditions on a loan that literally kept the nation afloat; also unlike today\'s CEOs, he never got his money back. He died impoverished in 1806, but not before becoming the nation\'s first effective Secretary of the Treasury (before 1789, that is).\n\nJohn Morton, Pennsylvania: Despite living in a Loyalist-dominated part of the colony, and personally preferring reconciliation with Great Britain, Morton signed the Declaration. His neighbors turned on him, and he was forced to remain in Philadelphia. Just before his death in 1777, he submitted to Congress what became known as the "Articles of Confederation".\n\nThomas Nelson, Virginia: Nelson lived in Yorktown, which of course saw the final showdown of the Revolutionary War. As American guns shelled the British defenses, an anguished Nelson (now a General in the Continental Army) saw that they were sparing his house, which was General Cornwallis\' headquarters. As the story goes, Nelson personally turned a cannon towards his home and blew it up, to show that he was no less willing to sacrifice than his fellow Virginians. He loaned over $2 million to the Continental Congress, none of which was repaid, and died impoverished.\n\nThe entire South Carolina delegation: All four Palmetto State signatories paid dearly for joining the cause for Independence. Edward Rutledge (the pro-slavery aristocrat in 1776), Arthur Middleton and Thomas Heyward, Jr. were all imprisoned by the British when Charleston was taken in 1780. They were beaten and humiliated in prison, then released to their plantations a year later - which of course had been burned to the ground and completely pillaged. They were more fortunate than co-signatory Thomas Lynch - he disappeared at sea while seeking medical help in the West Indies, together with his young wife, at some point in 1779.\n\nLyman Hall, Georgia: a physician who had earned his degree from Yale, Dr. Hall helped to supply food and provisions for the Continental Army throughout the war. Despite living the furthest away from Philadelphia of all the signers, he returned to Georgia just once between 1775 and 1780 (when his friend and co-signer Button Gwinnett was killed in a duel). The British burned his property when they seized Savannah in 1780, and after escaping the siege of Charleston found refuge in Connecticut.\n\n[Source](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2011/7/4/991181/-)'

Upon taking office as sheriff, he diversified the department, redirected BSO\'s mission to focus on reducing violent crime, keeping kids out of jail and addressing the disadvantaged members of our community, including the homeless and mentally ill. As a result, crimes, including violent offenses, are down significantly and juvenile arrests have decreased through the Civil Citation program. Broward County is safer and more united as a result of his programs, community outreach initiatives and his leadership."\n\nHe is not a rough and tumble John Wayne, he is an elected pink teddy bear friend of Hillary Clinton.

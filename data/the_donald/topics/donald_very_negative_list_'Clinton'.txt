💥💥 Two women who accused Bill Clinton of sexually assaulting them say it is time for his South Dakota statue to be destroyed. "Take a Sledgehammer to It!" 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
**BREAKING** Bill Clinton Now Has 4 New Victims Accusing Him of Rape
Ruh roh! FEC complaint alleges Hillary Clinton camp/DNC broke the law over Trump dossier
FBI has confirmed after 12 hours that Vegas shooter has no ties to ISIS, but after 9 months, FBI still can't be sure Trump has no ties to Russia.
Harvey Weinstein helped pay for Bill Clinton's legal defense for all his bad, bad things he did. August 22, 1998 story. Many other Hollyweird people spent bigly too, So many scandals then, "the firm handling Clinton's defense in the Whitewater, Lewinsky and other investigations". Too many to list.
Crooked Hillary Clinton, the worst loser of all time, has only one thing left to lose. Let's help her check off that last box!
Trump Tweet: So General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed, while Crooked Hillary Clinton, on that now famous FBI holiday “interrogation” with no swearing in and no recording, lies many times...and nothing happens to her? Rigged system, or just a double standard?
"That's a classic. So many questions so little time. Did she even get to ask what happened to all the women her husband raped? What happened to the White House furniture?  "
"AWESOME vid!  Shake that bitch up!  Make her heart jump into her throat!  **What happened to Seth Rich?!**  Everyone knows she's a murderer.  A multi-murdering piece of crap!"
'Props to that lady but she will now die of an apparent suicide with two bullet to the back of her head and a letter stating Killary did nothing wrong '
"Her defense mechanism when she's caught lying or cornered is always to cackle. It's quite unnerving"
'"thanks for having me"\n\n# "its great for you to be here"\n\nWHAT KIND OF FUCKING RESPONSE IS THAT?! WHAT AN EGOTISTICAL PIECE OF FUCKING SHIT THIS BITCH'
'I watch this video and all I can wonder is what kind of losers line up to meet a loser and buy the book about how she lost? \n'
"Did the crime kingpin finally go to prison?   Nope.  it's all good tho cuz she got some sass at a fucking book signing."
'Her internal monologue \n\n>What happened is I got away with murder'
'After she asked "Hillary, what happened to your health?" I would have pissed my pants if Hillary shouted back "What difference at this point does it make *psychopathic laughter*" '
'Ew her evil fucking cackle after that woman began asking questions made me want to vomit.'
'"What happened to Seth rich?"\nYou killed him\n"Which one was he again?"'
'Well she did the cackle, but she neglected to use the words "That\'s ridiculous" like she\'s done so often before.'
'So she paid over $1000 just to see this loser and ask this question?\nI mean Killary was charging people money to come see her.\nShe knows he book is going to fail and that is how she is recovering her loss sales money'
"Sad part is that she'll get a nice, country club type cell, with servants and bodyguards.  Anyone else would get put in general population or isolation reserved for terrorists and serial killers."
'Caption Contest!\n\nHillary: "What an honor it must be for you, a lowly pissant peasant, to meet me, the most bagged out, dried up piece of rancid slunk meat to ever leave the trail of a slug in my career as an American politician."'
"Huma being there makes me suspicious.  Why is she there?  Wouldn't she be looking for a new job since Hillary lost?\n\nIs this evil old woman planning to run again?"
'Bu bu but ma rape legacy...!'
'CNN:  MUSLIMS being mistreated.  Rapist Bill Clinton`s statue threatened.  '
"Seattle mayor calls for Lenin statue to get taken down. Polls show most Americans want monuments to stay. The scope of the dumb lefties' ire and righteous anger have broadened past Confederate monuments, to statues of Lincoln and former Philadelphia mayor Frank Rizzo. Now this. Bolsheviks foiled again!"
'I dont think silence from the high ground is a good strategy anymore. Agreed, we probably don\'t want statues torn down (so petty! Who cares?) but standing apart from the latest ridiculous snowflake demand only gives them permission to escalate. (Aren\'t they already screaming for Washington Monument to come down, or something like that?)\n\nSo we counter: If you tear down Robert E Lee, how about Stalin comes down, too.\n\nNot because we actually are so intellectually feeble that we think history can and should be erased. But so we can redpill reasonable middle-road voters by demonstrating that 1) the Alt Left is a bunch of hypocrites 2) there are lots of "questionable" statues around  And 3) this could go on forever\n\n(Demanding Bill come down is actually brilliant; Reminds everyone that he\'s a Rapist and forces people to think thru the whole idea of taking down structures of flawed famous people)'
"Eh, look I am no fan of Bill Clinton (Is a Rapist infowarsdotcom) but these calls to remove statues is getting retarded. We don't like it when the leftist retards call for it, we shouldn't either. I did support the calls for removing the Stalin statue, it's akin to having an Adolf Hitler statue in Tribute of WWII. However, Clinton was a US president and has his part in history. Enough of this no more calls to erase history from both sides."
'I thought this was a troll post at first because of the url. Why does the url say something completely different than the story? \n\n"bill-clinton-accusers-want-confederate-statue-destroyed-rapid-city-south-dakota" is the url\n\n"Two women who accused former President Bill Clinton of sexually assaulting them said it is time for his South Dakota statue to be destroyed." is the story\n\nThe Confederates were Democrats so maybe we should just refer to any Democrat statue as a Confederate statue.'
"This is a bad idea and mirrors altleft actions. A number of presidents have had sordid histories. Let's not make a habit of destroying our past. Even the bad parts. "
"If the alt left wants to tear down offensive statues, it should be ALL offensive statues. Aren't they the party for equality?? Oh wait."
'#[Bill Clinton caught hiding in the bushes after attempting to sabotage statues of Republican Presidents]( http://i.imgur.com/S9EAJPf.jpg )'
'Leave the statue up as a reminder of his betrayal to the law.'
'why is this nation so petty that it attacks every last damn statue?! stop tearing down statues!!! Including confederate ones, that shit is our history!!\n\nbut also an eye for an eye does sound kinda appropriate imho'
"No fuck off we're not stooping to their level. Removing any historical statues is retarded and is Orwellian as fuck. Leave Bill Clinton's statue alone. I don't like the dude either but if it's wrong when they do it it's also wrong when we do it. "
'Fuck all this "innocent til proven guilty" garbage! Tear it down!!! /s'
'I agree. This rapist did not even deserve to become president, and now we must avenge those poor women who were sexually abused by him. Take down the statue!\n\nHillary Clinton has helped Bill Clinton to prevent him from having to go to jail. So she did not deserve to become president either. It has also been said that she was a criminal for other reasons as well.'
"How can so many racist American's assume the Statue of Liberty's gender? So offensive.\n\n#take her down\n\n#edit: take it down"
'BILL CLINTON IS A RAPIST '
"Guys we need to destroy the Grim Raper's statue"
"Really? There's really a Statue of 'Bill Clinton' in South Dakota?\n\nTo bad we didn't have the Sex offenders law back when this bastard was President. "
"why is everybody all worked up lately about destroying works of art?  It  seems incredibly moronic to me.  Its a work of art, if you don't like it - don't look at it. "
'Being the fire and fury to any lefty statue! 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣'
'Hmm.. Just a 6 hour drive. Is it worth it to hang a "BILL CLINTON IS A RAPIST" sign around his neck?'
"Webster Hubble's daughter's fill-in guardian is a rapist. "
"Fuck him and his statue. He's a rapist ffs."
"No!!! We're no better than them if we advocate. The world needs to remember that Bill Clinton is a rapist. \n\nAlso inforwars.com"
"I would say let's all just get together and fund a new statue of Clinton raping, put it nearby."
'Bill Clinton is a Fullbright Alt-left Carpet Bagging Rapist POS.'
'Rapists are bad.'
'This is all so stupid, might as well just go full retard like the commies have. If they want a Cultural Revolution for the U.S., then let them have it, and let them get destroyed. Remove all statues of leftists, and then remove all leftists.'
"Dinesh D'Souza was sent to prison for a minor violation of campaign finance laws."
'I feel like a lot of the people who just went along with it in the media- not the hardline shills- will be pissed at the clintons for making them look stupid. They have backed them and covered for them for over two years and now that this is all coming out they will want to salvage their careers.'
'The media and Dems were screaming TREASON from the rooftops when Don Jr. supposedly met with a Russian to get dirt on Hillary and that never happened.  The amount of money Hillary/DNC paid for this fake dossier is beyond unbelievable...and the FBI used fake information to spark an investigation??  FUMING!!  '
"A LOT of Liberal power players hate Hillary. She forced them to do her bidding for years. It's payback time!"
'Breaking news: WaPo found dead'
'At this point they (the MSM) are going to try to go for small ball.  If all Hillary & crew get busted for is campaign finance law, then they\'re getting off with a slap on the wrist.  So they\'ll focus on this and if they are convicted of breaking campaign finance law, they\'ll start crying about a "bloodthirsty" GOP and are able to cry witch hunt and stupid slogans like "Just leave Hillary alone" etc.  \n\nThe dossier should be the tip of the iceberg for Russian collusion. '
'The leftist media does this trick. First they ignore, when that fails they pick up the story pretending to attack criticaly and then they pivot to "oh nothing here after all".'
'#I\'m still hung up on the FUCKING EMAILS\n\n\nIf they let some major ass shit like that go then you guys need to stop getting your hopes up \n\n\n**Its a "nothing burger".... even though it\'s not**'
'You know what’s crazy, if this story was about trump there would be about 70k upvotes. Since it is about Clinton, we will max out at about 10k. The amount of idiotic, clueless, brainwashed people on Reddit actually sickens me. '
"What's the penalty for FEC violations, a fine?  I don't care about that.  LOCK HER UP."
'So playing as a devils advocate, if the DNC leadership knew this was all baloney, why would they  push so fucking hard for a special prosecutor that would ultimately fuck themselves?\n\nMy initial thought is that current DNC leadership and officials may not have known it was all a ruse, and the old Guard, Donna Brazille, Holder, Lynch, Clinton’s and Obama were holding it close to the chest.\n\nMaybe they were rolling the dice that the investigator would find something in Trumps financials?'
'This is what bothers me.\n\nEveryone on Reddit has (and still is) throwing a shit fit that the Trump campaign *may* have seeked information against Hillary from an outside source, such as Wikileaks or Russia, which is "influencing the election".\n\nNow, we have sure fire facts that the Clintard campaign/DNC did pay for a fake dossier that was supplied by a foreign agent and there is complete silence.  Where is the "this is a threat to our democracy and election system" bullshit they\'ve been screaming about?\n\nIt\'s funny, I almost feel like the Mueller investigation is just going to turn dirt over on the Clinton\'s and DNC, rather than what the liberal idiots expected.'
'You know you fucked up when the Wapo actually has to start doing some journalism . '
'BILL CLINTON IS A RAPIST!!! INFOWARS.COM = REAL NEWS!!! CNN = FAKE NEWS!!! '
'Do t get ripped off by a $9M fake dossier! If anyone needs a fake dossier, I’ll write one up for only $8M. '
"Pretty sad that I have to come to this shitreddit to find discussion of a topic that is all over the headlines of every news site. I hate reddit and their censorship so much. Even more I hate the idiots that are so easily brainwashed by the 'curators' of reddit and the narrative that they push. \n\nNo offense, just venting on how much I hate this shitty website. "
"Remember when Jedi Skywalker walked into Jabba the Hut's palace and killed everyone? \n\nThat's Trump in the Swamp."
'what is horrifying is that if WaPo is throwing HRC under the bus, it would only be to protect a higher up. BUT THERE IS NO HIGHER UP EXCEPT OBAMA\n\nAnd if the uranium 1 informant is to be believed, **the president at the time - Obama - was receiving daily updates on this deal, so HE KNEW**\n\nTHATS how deep and rotten this goes. Holy crap.'
'I live in Trump Country. The White Mountains of Arizona near the New Mexico border. We even have  Trump Store in town. HOWEVER if you do not subscribe to anything beyond basic on your TV cable there is NO NEWS about Uranium One, FusionGPS or any of the new hearings. We do pick up a remote radio station on the car radio with Rush, Sean, and Laura. \n\nThis morning I looked at the Safeway Stores news stand. Arizona Republic "Flake and Trump Feud" and WSJ "Trade Wars". A quick scan and that\'s about it. My biz partner over in So. Calif. calls me every morning for an update. He is mid 70s and refuses to touch a computer. \n\nAmerica folks.'
'In other words ..... Bill Clinton is a rapist.  \n\nspez:  WOOHOOO!  My first sticky!    \n\n**MODS ARE GODS!**'
"If any of these women happened after 1998, it's on the Dems. They let these women get raped. They knew he was sick fuck and covered for him and let him keep destroying lives. "
"The lefties are distancing themselves from the Clintons. The shroud is being lifted if CNN is reporting this. Their power is gone... \n\nOR this is some sham. A setup in the news now to payoff at a later date. Example: notice the Hollywood sexual assault accusations never actually had legal charges but everyone reported on them? Those allegations suddenly stopped when Roy Moore was abruptly accused. Now he's the only one anyone reports on. Odd, no?"
'This is all terrible -D chess by the left to try and get Trump inpeached.  They will throw the Clintons under the bus because they have 0 political capital now. Then they will say "see, we disavowed the Clintons because of accusations so we must inpeach Drumf for the same thing."  '
'Who said he was a rapist all along? INFOWARS.COM BABY!'
'I’ve come to two possible realizations (AH HAH!):\n\n1. Is this the rape culture that these “crazies” have been talking about? Just misinterpreted by the many about college campuses? Maybe the signs were read incorrectly and there was this outcry against the many actors and politicians doing these things to innocent people?\n\n2. The same people never expected this to backfire. Claiming that there is a celebrated rape culture that ties in with white men, white conservative men, and then never expecting the truth to unfold. \n\nIt’s like they come up with these band-aid short term “solutions” that evolve into more problems. Looking at the development of the year, how things have turned around immensely. Another three...damn I can’t even imagine! '
'And to think if those 70,000 people in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan were lazy and decided to stay home NONE of this would have ever come out.   First Rapist in White House.'
'He should be arrested and convicted if found to be guilty. Same goes for Donald Trump'
'Reporters should repeatedly scream at Crooked Hillary everywhere she goes, "Are you starting back up your Bimbo Eruptions operations to degrade your Husbands new rape accusers?"'
'Clinton boy have ran out of the "national security" trap card to protect himself this time\n\nIf anyone were to ask why the victims are talking now, and weren\'t talking before, explain to them that this is one of the several ways that the Clintons have shutted down rape victims before'
"You mean four **new** ones.  \n\n\nWe've known he's been raping underage girls for years.\n\n\nAs the DNC and hillary     ♬Stands ♫ by ♩ her ♪ man ♬"
"Of course he's a rapist. We've known this for 2-3 decades."
'If only hillary would have put out instead of being a cold ass bitch. '
"democrats don't care about throwing bill under the bus now, hes done with and they no longer need him. basically a sacrifice for what they are going to try to pull on trump when more fake accusers come out against trump."
'Every time this guy gets accused of rape, I start looking for the next murder he is trying to cover up. '
'No wonder that bitch tried to burn her house down!!'
'So much incriminating information has been revealed to the public since last January.\n\nAnd yesterday it was announced that Sessions had appointed interim investigators (meaning kick out the Obama holdovers, the worst of whom probably had to be smoked out since they were hiding their disloyalty).\n\nSessions is taking his time and doing it right.\n\n'
'Lock Her Up!\n\n#HILLARY FOR PRISON'
"Mark my words...Hillary will soon reveal the terrible sickness she has been so valiantly fighting while doing her best to sheild the public from her misery so she could persist to resist the current leadership as only she so selflessly is able to do.  \n\nToo sick to stand trial.  Might even use the side of beef video as proof.    \n\nGod I hope I'm wrong."
'#OH SHIT LOCK THAT BITCH UP'
'#HILLARY FOR PRISON 2018'
'Maybe this whole Bannon dispute is a smoke-screen for the liberals to keep them occupied with nonsense while Clinton is investigated. '
'Fuck Sessions and his war on "muh Marijuana". He just handed the mid terms to the DEMs.'
'What a cucked ass article. "Caved to pressure..." my ass. The original "investigation" was a total sham. '
'If Hillary had just left Donald alone and not crank up the Russia shit she could have skated.  She just had to fuck with him.  Ask Bannon where that gets you.'
'i have to say this.  trump is a master at playing the media as well as bannon.  to have that book come out and the media FAWWNNNINGG at this stuff, is totally distracting from all this shit going on.  I swear Trump does this stuff with bannon just to take the focus off of him so he can get shit done!'

'Gag order lifted.  Release of all JFK files.  Release of all Clinton files.  Not sure what Muellers indictment is going to be but Trump knows and this is in response to it.  Wait and see.  There was NEVER any chance he was on the up and up.  NONE.  He been a huge part of the criminal activity for decades.  9/11 false flag cover up the biggest of all.\n\nBuckle up kids.....'
"Holy shit.  War has gone full scale now.   Trump, et al vs. Mueller, et al.   I don't know whether to grab some popcorn or find an underground bunker.  This ride is going to get wild!"
"Yeah, this is crazy. A few days after we find out who paid for the dossier revealing it for what it truly is for everyone to see and definitely not verified intelligence. One day after he releases the JFK files that the CIA didn't want released. Trump just instructed the release of the rest of the Clinton emails. And Trump is going to release the rest of the JFK files the CIA want hidden. With Mueller all of a sudden bringing charges Monday? With that timing, I'm thinking we are about to enter a civil war vs the deepstate. Pray for the president, he has many enemies right now."
'God damn right\n\nThat is HIS state department. His guy Rex at the helm\n\nHow the hell **could** they have been refusing to release them?!'
'#WTF I hate transparency now!'
"Yep, forget this 2020 crap.  Trump needs people to be put in their place now, not on the next election cycle.   I mean let's forget about all of the details of the corruption, and look at what the corruption is causing.....it's causing unnecessary controversy around a democratically elected rightful president, and it's not only interfering with his presidency, it's potentially putting his family in danger because with all of this rhetoric from the left, some crazy person could one day try to hurt his children and grand children, all because of a bunch of fake news and fake hit job dossier's.   Kid gloves off, this isn't just politics anymore.  This is the real world where actions have consequences, where people get physically hurt.....and democrats are promoting it.  This is why inciting riots is illegal, and that's exactly what the left has done.  We need to start having people arrested.  "
"It's game time bitches. The lion is gonna strike!"
"Yeah, this is crazy. A few days after we find out who paid for the dossier. One day after he releases the JFK files that the CIA didn't want released. Trump just instructed the release of the rest of the Clinton emails. And Trump is going to release the rest of the JFK files the CIA want hidden. Also after lifting a gag order... I'm thinking we are about to enter a civil war vs the deepstate. Pray for the president."
'Jeff Sessions WAKE THE FUCK UP'
"Why aren't we throwing her a pity party? \n\nShe got caught you know.  Being forced to cheat and having to cover it up is stressful. "
'Unless the evil witch has paid off/bribed the entire FEC, this might lead somewhere.'
'She broke a lot of laws already and fucking jack shit happened to her or anyone in that admin. =\\'
"That's right witch. Burn. Burn to dust in flames. You're crime family days are over. Do the world a favor and have a heart attack before we the people send your ass to jail for life."
'The complaint is from a legitimate non-profit, apolitical organization. Seriously, they aren’t left or right leaning. So this is shocking. '
"Why are we concerned about a presidential candidate colluding with a foreign power? \n\nBecause the whole problem with Trump colluding with Russia in order to beat Hillary Clinton was the idea that this relationship would allow the Russians to blackmail Trump and hurt American interests. \n\nSo if Hillary Clinton paid a company to gather info from Russian she jeopardized American interests as well. \n\nDON'T USE FOREIGN POWERS TO GET POWER BECAUSE THEN THEY OWN YOUR ASS!!!"
'This family is so evil that I am now having trouble sleeping due to worry over what her treason will result in happening re: yellow cake! For money she and Bill have sold all of us into Hell ! There is no fate too vile for her family to suffer. The thousands of dead and crippled she has or will cause hang over their heads. Obama, too! That worthless scum needs to be sent to Hell with his bitch whore wife and soon.'
"Yet 1 person died in Charlottesville and they make it seem like we're the worst people ever. \n\nWe need to get back to society where it was survival of the fittest and we did not cater to these mentally ill, lazy,narcissistic, entitled, low iq, easily manipulated emotional snowflakes. \n\nYou can see it now trump is trying to make them accountable for their life and give them an opportunity to make a living for themselves and not depend on the state. Yet they fucking investigate him for muh Russia, and  retaliate by forming domestic terror groups such as Antifa. Whats funny is if they fight as hard making a life for themselves as they do fighting the right and being domestic terrorist we might be able to get something done.\n\nAlso on muh Russia does anyone think maybe it's the left dealing with Russia and they are simply projecting it onto the right? Maybe the left is in cohoots with them selling Facebook ads and stirring racial division and funding groups such as Antifa and BLM. Just saying\n\n"

"Girlfriend/female companion is Indonesian(a Muslim country)..  she rents a room for him in the hotel then immediately leaves the country.  His brother claims there's no reason for him to have done this but admits they hadn't spoken in 6 months. ISIS claims he converted within that time period. \n\nHas a family history of violent mental illness, no experience at all with guns yet somehow converted multiple rifles from semi to full auto which requires metal working tools.\n\nIts pretty credible to me that his girlfriend took advantage of his lonely and mentally unstable state to convert him to islam and he went online and got in contact with ISIS people who taught him how to convert the weapons.\n\nHow can the FBI eliminate that possibility so quickly??? There's no way they had already analyzed his phone and computers 12 hours after the attack.  They hadn't even interviewed the girlfriend in person, just by phone cause she is abroad.  Something is really strange about this."
'Incoming "assualt weapons" ban talk by the libs. Oh wait, Obama can\'t push that bs narrative!'
"No they haven't.  That was never said.  They said they can't find any record of ties.\n\nI'd hope had they did, they'd have stopped the guy??  Maybe all the other terrorists before him?"
"Just look at how each story jives with the narrative. It's easy after that. \n\nDemocrats are pathetic.  \n\nEdit: I don't believe for 1 second that this shooter wasn't radicalized, and or a violent leftist terrorist. \n\nIt's 1 or the other. "

And here he is pretending that he’s a news person and zero people call a spade a spade. \n\nIf Donald Rumsfeld became a “journalist” can you imagine how crazy people would get? The Clinton White House is the only White House impeached in the living generation. The only White House where 3 women accused the president of rape.

'So you guys know:\n\n1. Hillary loses and cannot cover up super illegal Uranium One deal with own cabinet positions. Must have made a lot of people in govt a lot of money to find so many "helpers" in illicit activity. I believe this is much bigger than Clintons, I think this was a circle of a lot of people up to and including guys like McCain.\n2. Need to get "Russia" cover story in the public spotlight to send an "investigation" in to "investigate" the Russia issue.\n3. What better than to blame it on Trump? Let him take the heat while the FBI to go "look into this issue" Sounds dumb but public buys it!\n4. Trump unexpectedly fires Comey. Comey, Clinton, Obama, etc all panic and Comey does a very illegal thing to get a "Special Council" in there to keep cleaning up for the Clinton and Obama administrations (memo)\n5. Mueller is an old loyalist, he goes in to "investigate" Trump and Russia.\n6. They hire only loyalists since each of the people on the special council are going to find out what is really going on here. (Trump/Russia is a cover story)\n7. The FBI does what the FBI does in situations like this. They bring everybody in for questioning presenting "immunity" deals to turn over all evidence... and zip their mouths\n8. The second somebody gives them evidence, they hide it away, shred it, whatever\n9. Person who got immunity deal, cannot speak about it, doesn\'t want to speak about it because its a get out of jail free card (in a lot of cases) They are free and clear and nobody wants to shake that boat. Nicer to go home and be with their family\n10. Mueller quietly continues what Comey was doing on destroying evidence to cover up RICO issues with many people in the the federal government and Obama administration.\n11. The public is set off track thinking this has anything to do with Trump.\n\nYou guys know Trump/Russia is just a cover story for what is really going on... right? Its really about covering up the filthy shit they were all doing from the Clinton Foundation to McCabe\'s wife and the Obama administration. They were *all* getting down and dirty on this deal. The FBI and DoJ was covering for it. Something is *still* wrong with the FBI and DoJ! They are *still* covering for it! Also, the only reason Comey opened up the "investigation" into Hillary\'s emails last November is because Wikileaks was releasing info, the NYPD found an "Insurance File" on Weiner\'s Laptop... Comey literally freaked out and started trying to play dumb thinking the whole house of cards was coming down. (everybody for themselves) When Wikileaks and NYPD info didn\'t leak anything he didn\'t know how to explain, he went back to "nothing to see here folks! move along!"'

Don't get your hopes up, the swamp is deep, and everyone has a vested interest in hiding each others crimes."
"This means nothing. All the top creatures of the swamp will remain unscathed like always. Till we have a DOJ that actually gives a fuck about law and order no matter the person, nothing will ever get done. We've had mountains of evidence for fucking months. I will be genuinely surprised if arrests come to Obama, Clinton, lynch, Comey and everyone else involved. "

'INB4 "These things take time. Be patient." \n\nIt\'s hard to reconcile that with the speed with which Mueller was appointed. I think that\'s the key frustration that many of the over-optimists don\'t understand. Why didn\'t the Dems have to be patient? With Republicans in power, no less. Then Sessions says we don\'t target our political opponents, all while this Mueller witch hunt is staring him in the face. No precedent for targeting an outgoing administration, huh? What about an incoming one?\n\nIt looks as if their goal is to bumrush through the Mueller thing on manufactured grounds and worry about the corruption loose ends and brazen double standards later, when anything about Obama and the Clintons can be stonewalled and made to fizzle into nothing. The GOP hasn\'t received anything close to enough heat over this. It should be priority #1 on this sub. \n\nAs for the Sessions hearing today, PM me your best nudes if this prediction turns out to be correct: It will be Sessions further reinforcing the frame of defense, defense, defense... with no signs of any legal counterattack whatsoever. My fap bin is empty and waiting. \n\n**Update:** So the DOJ apparently isn\'t in the business of revealing the existence of an investigation. I seem to remember some guy named Comey seeking permission from the DOJ to reveal the existence of a Russian-collusion investigation against the Trump administration, something he dropped during a highly anticipated Congressional opening statement. Funny how that works out. I guess an investigation *can* be revealed if it benefits Democrats for months in the media. Why do I get the feeling there\'s no investigation whatsoever and Sessions is simply hiding behind muh DOJ protocolz? '

'It is so irritating seeing the clown comments pushed to the top, seeing those sad liberals all over his tweets'
'Why does he have go on Twitter and ask “Where is the Justice Dept” He is the damn President. Why doesn’t he summon the heads of the Justice Dept to his office and tell them to either deal with this or be fired. Sounds like Rosenstein might need to resign now anyway since he is up to his neck in the Uranium One deal corruption. Enough with the stupid Twitter. I think people would prefer if he did weekly web cast or Facebook live if he wants to speak directly to the people. Twitter is a shit show.'

It doesn\'t question Sessions performance.\nYou can interpret it the way you want, but this does not constitute Trump stating his displeasure with Sessions performance.\nYou still haven\'t shown me proof.\nHaving followed Trump for more than thirty years. Reading his books and understanding his strategic thinking, I think this is being played the only way it can be.  I really have no opinion one way or the other on Sessions presently. If I\'m right, Trump is strategically manipulating events via Twitter and public statements in order to set the stage. This is all about timing and momentum and if they go too soon, they never get another chance. Making it "appear" perhaps that Sessions is a reluctant warrior in the fight against Clinton Inc. is more than likely part of Trumps overall strategy, but of course you know that.....right?\nWhat is gained by announcing your intentions.?What is gained telling your enemy what you have on them before you know you have a kill shot?\nIn the end, \nOne of us will be right on this, but if I\'m right.....we both win.

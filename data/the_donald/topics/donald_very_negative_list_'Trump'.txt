African American unemployment is the lowest ever recorded in our country. The Hispanic unemployment rate dropped a full point in the last year and is close to the lowest in recorded history. Dems did nothing for you but get your vote! #NeverForget @foxandfriends
While not at all presidential I must point out that the Sloppy Michael Moore Show on Broadway was a TOTAL BOMB and was forced to close. Sad!
Many mostly Democrat States refused to hand over data from the 2016 Election to the Commission On Voter Fraud. They fought hard that the Commission not see their records or methods because they know that many people are voting illegally. System is rigged, must go to Voter I.D.
Congressman Devin Nunes: "So here we are in, you know, February of 2018 with absolutely no evidence of Trump colluding with Russians, but we have lots of evidence that everybody continues to ignore that the Hillary campaign was colluding with Russians"
Congratulations to @ABC News for suspending Brian Ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia, Russia, Russia Witch Hunt. More Networks and “papers” should do the same with their Fake News!
So much Fake News is being reported. They don’t even try to get it right, or correct it when they are wrong. They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author, who knowingly writes false information. The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election!
@realDonaldTrump: This will be a big week for Infrastructure. After so stupidly spending $7 trillion in the Middle East, it is now time to start investing in OUR Country!
So funny to watch the Fake News, especially NBC and CNN. They are fighting hard to downplay the deal with North Korea. 500 days ago they would have “begged” for this deal-looked like war would break out. Our Country’s biggest enemy is the Fake News so easily promulgated by fools!

Gold Star Widow Releases Trump’s Call After Husband Was Killed In Afghanistan

President Trump: "Little Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!"
So General Michael Flynn’s life can be totally destroyed while Shadey James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written). Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work? I don’t think so!

So sad to see the Terror Attack in Paris. At some point countries will have to open their eyes & see what is really going on. This kind of sickness & hatred is not compatible with a loving, peaceful, & successful country! Changes to our thought process on terror must be made.
The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition. Crime in Germany is way up. Big mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!
There is a Revolution going on in California. Soooo many Sanctuary areas want OUT of this ridiculous, crime infested & breeding concept. Jerry Brown is trying to back out of the National Guard at the Border, but the people of the State are not happy. Want Security & Safety NOW!
When people come into our Country illegally, we must IMMEDIATELY escort them back out without going through years of legal maneuvering. Our laws are the dumbest anywhere in the world. Republicans want Strong Borders and no Crime. Dems want Open Borders and are weak on Crime!
@realDonaldTrump: We should have a contest as to which of the Networks, plus CNN and not including Fox, is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!
POTUS: Democrats and liberals in Congress want to disarm law-abiding Americans at the same time they are releasing dangerous criminal aliens and savage gang members onto our streets. Politicians who put criminal aliens before American Citizens should be voted out of office!

The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught, called out and fired. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife’s campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M, who was also under investigation? How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!
Disgrace! The black caucus sits silent as Trump announces low unemployment among African Americans. They know their base is leaving them.

@DJT: Democrats are the problem. They don’t care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our Country, like MS-13. They can’t win on their terrible policies, so they view them as potential voters!
Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!

"I don't understand how the US doesn't have Voter ID requirements in place.  It's mind boggling that even a 2nd world country like India requires you to have ID to vote and America doesn't.  Up here in Canada you have to be registered to vote and still show your ID as proof of residence even with your voter card.\n\nIt just doesn't make sense how this has been allowed to go on for so long.\n\nAnd fighting to not show the voting records?  What the fuck?  How are those states allowed to get away with that?  People need to start being dragged into public hearings and shamed on national TV.  It's ridiculous."

'I love all the Liberals this morning saying they beat back voter ID bc he ended the commission. The Reeeeeeetards never Learn he Art Of Wars this shit.

'And here come the liberals crying “racist” for absolutely no good reason other than fear of losing votes.'
'The only reason why someone wouldn’t support voter ID is because they think blacks are too stupid to get one or they want more illegal voting.'
"This is the most important battle. It is the only battle. If we don't get our elections secured and ensure 1 vote for 1 American, then everything Trump has done and will do is pointless. We will get more communists in power and America as we know it is gone in 10 years. They won't wait to transform it and risk losing power again. The way the current system is implemented, no place is safe. They can steal every last seat if they were able to get one in Alabama. Also there have got to be very severe and very public consequences for the rank and file elections officials. The little guys at the county precincts who are actually implementing this fraud have got to pay severely. There are always going to be powerful people trying to rig the game, but they can't do it without the people on the ground. Those people have to be made an example of such that when the next rich guy comes around waving stacks of 100 dollar bills to fudge the vote totals, the guy counting will tell them to go fuck themselves. The penalties for election fraud should keep everyone participating up at night. Election fraud is not a singular crime, it is a crime against all of us. It's a desecration of the legacy of our ancestors who fought and died so we could vote for our leaders. It should be treated as such."

"Let's be clear on one thing.  The real reason Democrats didn't want to pass this bill wasn't because they honestly believe it wasn't a good bill. It was because it's sounding their death knell.....the end of Democrat elitist control. \n\nThey didn't vote FOR this bill because it effectively ended any chance they had in the 2018 midterms to take either house and any chance at taking back the WH in 2020. \n\nThey didn't vote for it because they have no message, no money left in the coffers, too many of them are going to be going to jail or retiring early, which means they'll have no recognizable face, they lost the governorships, they lost the state assemblies, they lost the Supreme Court, they lost the national judiciary, and they're losing everything they politicized such as the FBI, the DOJ and the IRS. \n\nThe only thing they DO have left is control of legacy MSM and that's why they're pushing all the bullshit lies they can 24/7 using MSNBC, GMA, The View, CNN, Morning Joeanne and that dude Ricky Maddow.  \n\nEven THAT is crumbling. CNN is at unbelievable lows, liberal reporters are getting caught up in sexual harassment scandals, they're being forced to retract lies, people are waking up and ISM Internet Streaming Media is taking over.  This is why they freaked out over 'Net Neutrality'. They're freaking the fuck out at not being able to control and censor on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and Google.  They know they'll have to ease up, or face 1 of 2 if not a combination of both things: Competition or Anti-Trust lawsuits. \n\nThis is all about power and them losing the last grasp of it IN EVERY WAY IMAGINABLE, that they've previously enjoyed for the last 24 years. If they didn't control the WH, they had had the Senate and or House. \n\nThey now have **NOTHING**."

'So, I have a few questions about the memo, maybe you pedes can help with.\n\nWhich parts of the dossier were proved conclusively false, and did they have anything at all proven true?\n\nIf the FBI said they never would have gotten the wiretaps without the dossier, why were they using that to listen to Carter Page? What was in there about the person of interest, and if there was nothing, how did the dossier strengthen their case at all?\n\nAnd last, and most important, Steele was desperate to keep Trump from getting elected. Assuming for a moment that Trump was a Russian stooge, and this guy had the proof (which would be a reasonable reason to desperately not want Trump elected, if you had proof), why would anyone include false infomation with true information in the dossier? If I had rock solid proof the Clintons ordered a murder (pick any one, they\'ve had a lot of shady shit occur over the years), and wanted to send it to the FBI, the very last thing I would do is include a baseless b.s. claim also to throw doubt on the rest, like, "Not only did they have Seth Rich murdered, but I know Hillary personally killed Nicole Brown Simpson!" It makes any evidence I might have for Seth Rich seem just as stupid by association.\n\nThanks!'

"There was no collusion with the Russians at all. Even for Hillary.\n\nIf you're referring to the sale of uranium... well, that's just being a traitor selling a strategic military resource to a rival nuclear power. If Trump were Putin and someone from America offered him uranium on a silver platter, he would accept it too.\n\nThe real collusion here would be between the Deep State (compromised elements within the executive branch), stooges in both parties e.g. McCain, and Big Media (social media giants, fake news merchants, Hollywood).\n\nThe 'Dossier' (the fabricated golden shower story) was the result of this unholy, subversive union. Mueller's so-called 'investigation' was the result of this unholy, subversive union.\n\nPutin had nothing to do with it.\n\nIn fact, Putin had been fighting the same elements within Russia: the usual suspects who want open borders, multiculturalism, Muslim migrants, transgender bathrooms etc.\n\nAlso, any politician in Europe who leaned towards nationalism was accused of being a 'Russian agent' or a 'Putin stooge'. Look at the leaders of Poland, Hungary and Austria now.\n\nEven pro-Brexit Nigel Farage was being accused of being a 'Russian agent'. Even conservative anchors on Fox News were demonized as 'Russian agents'.\n\nThere's collusion and conspiracy alright, but it has nothing to do with Russia."

'I get the inherent party bias and tendency for supporters to overlook flaws in favor of how the choose to perceive their candidate, but holy hypocrisy. \n\nKushner has a meeting in Washington deviate from an agenda, and there’s some kind of multi-generational Kushner/Trump Russian Mafia. \n\nManifort shuffling cards a little too heavy for his hands landed him in an indictment over what happened years before he took over, briefly, as a strategist. This amounts to, as the MSM would have you believe, nothing less than clear demonstrated intent to collude and evidence that Putin and Trump are as in sync as Russian figure skating duos. \n\nTo let the MSM tell it, each of these are evidence of Trump’s complicit role in the attack on our democracy and undermining of our election process which is threatening to our very existence as a nation! An investigation must indisputably prove his damnation! \n\nIronically, said investigation yields irrefutable evidence that  the flint used to start the “Russian collusion” fire, came DIRECTLY from HRC’s camp with top Justice department agents’ active roles/knowledge .

'Harvey Weinstein’s defense lawyer offered $750,000 tax-free cash to falsely accuse Donald Trump of rape just days before the election. The woman refused because she didn’t have any hard feelings against Trump because no sexual assault even happened.

'So liberals, what is it ? Are their countries shitholes or not? you\'re the ones who first used the "shithole" argument to keep them in the USA and now you are denying your own argument ?'
'Other than just reeeeing for the sake of reeeeing, what are leftists mostly upset about here? That he allegedly used the word “shithole” at all (the vulgarity)? That he allegedly directed it at specific nations (so it’s like elitist bullying)? Or that those specific nations largely contain darker skinned people (so he’s a racist)? \n\nWhich part of the vulgar racist bully narrative are they most faux-outraged about?\n\nTrump himself says he only used “tough” language, not this particular foul language. Even still, do I personally “like” this? Honestly, no. Not really. I tend to think cursing is lazy, something you should largely outgrow once you hit your 30’s. But that’s just me. Foul or tough language is certainly not something I’m going to feign outrage over. Besides, Presidents have used foul language as far back as you care to look. If anything is “Presidential,” it’s using colorful language.\n\nTo the other aspects, as the President’s tweets made clear this morning, these are “very poor and troubled, high-crime countries that are doing very badly.” That’s the point. And who could disagree with that? I’m sure leftists would have a hundred anti-American reasons as to WHY those nations are that way, but that won’t change the fact that Trump’s tweet is correct. Anyone who doesn’t start with the premise that Trump is a racist bully could easily see this was likely all he meant from the moment this “story” broke yesterday. \n\nThe Refugee program (which is a separate issue) is where America can debate showing compassion to those fleeing from poor, troubled, high-crime nations. But when it comes to our official legal immigration policy, I agree with the President that it should favor merit, track record, and evidence (like applying for a job interview), not tip the scales toward “compassion,” “fairness,” “ethnic diversity,” or “potential” at the exclusion of competency. \n\nIf people from other nations want to come here, live here, work here, pay taxes here, and eventually become citizens, why would we not attempt to actively prioritize the “best” of that bunch? Once you bust out of the lazy name-calling leftist brainwashing that such a policy would somehow be racist/sexist/bigoted, you can see with clear eyes why such a policy would benefit you, your children, your communities, and America as a whole.\n\n'

But they seem to forget there are a lot of us too, and they're starting to realize that having a bad reputation with US can hurt them just as bad.\n\nThey didn't use to believe they had to care about our opinion. Trump, our glorious leader has united us and we are more powerful than ever. "
'Now they\'re going to spin it like it\'s some sort of unreasonable expectation to require the players to do what\'s been done for many years.  These millionaires will whine and cry about being "slaves" and oppressed by the evil white man.'

"The best things this does is\n\nEliminate the marriage tax. Marriage tax (couples pay more taxes married than filing separately) is a really big deal for new couples who are starting out, especially if a new home or a new child is in their future.\n\nHas a 0% tax rate on those making under 25k/year/person. People who struggle to put food on the table for themselves and their families shouldn't be asked to give the government any more money.\n\nLower the brackets while simplyfing the tax code. It's easy to pretend that the people who earn the most pay the most but the tax code has more loopholes than a basketball net factory. A simpler code is a harder to cheat code. Lowering brackets means there won't be a revenue drop shock when the tax planning switches"
'What? Private citizens keep more of their hard earned money. OUTRAGEOUS! THIS MONSTER MUST BE STOPPED!'
'If the rate goes up on 300k plus I will be very disappointed. Small business owners will be hit VERY hard. '
"Actually, his election tax proposal would've set the top bracket at 25%, which is substantially lower than the 39.6% it currently sits at. It would've done away with subsidies, sure, but most people in the top tax bracket would've still seen a cut. I am guessing the 3 bracket system is DOA now. We are probably going to see a much more modest proposal, with more than 3 brackets."
'Mhm, confirms my suspicions that those Political Science Students at most Publick Universities get fed complete bullshit by their so called "Professors"...  '
'LMAO. These mindless drones have no fucking clue how to think for themselves or question authority (liberal professors). University is one gigantic echo-chamber "education" camps -- the antithesis of learning, evolving and critical thinking. \n**SAD!**'
'It\'s really frustrating to me that the majority of people are exactly like these people, and only care about who is proposing things, and not what they actually are. This is a really good way of exposing that fact. To some extent this is done on both sides of the political spectrum, but the left are particularly bad about ripping into right-wingers for certain things while totally ignoring things happening on "their side". For instance the Hillary Russia fiasco. They downvote that one en masse on politics. They can\'t handle the cognitive dissonance.'
'Why are they so stupid ...they are in college right..'
'Im sick of this shit. Why would anybody dismiss anything without even taking a look at it? That is the problem, they are such fucking sheep that they are programmed to groan whenever Trump proposes anything, even if it is something they would like.\n\nJesse Watters did a bunch of videos like this before the election, talking to college students, gave them a Trump quote and said it was Hillary. They were falling over themselves to agree with the statement when it was tied to her.'
'Stupid people saying "I woulda thought he\'d (Trump) be a little more stupid than that."\n\nYou can\'t make this up.'
"The saying you are a liberal before 30 and a conservative after is shown 100% in this video. These people agree with all the conservative views but doesn't like it if it has Trump's name on it. It's childish high school immature bullshit but they think they know everything and then fucking WHAM and reality hits them."
"As someone who just lost their Grandpa I'm all for getting rid of the Death Tax. It's fucking robbery and nothing more. At least they recognized they were programmed to hate anything Trump without ever doing the research for themselves. There's hope for these retards yet. "
'Amazing, they didn’t get violent or cover their ears and start screaming or flip him or anything like that. They actually admitted bias and one of the girls even said it’s hard to get another point of view because of the MSM. \n\nWe’re seeing live red-pilling.'
'Why the hell have colleges if they are so indoctrinated and ignorant of the truth.'
'They were talking shit about themselves before the video ended, lol losers '
'Ugh. First of all, the up speak by these children is incredibly grating on the ears. It implies a question rather than a statement and reeks of insecurity.\n\nSecondly, notice how everything comes back to "I". \n"I have experience as a social worker, so that makes a lot of sense"\n"I\'m from New Jersey, so....."\n\nThis group of young people seem so freaking egotistical and completely devoid of logic. They have no real world experience. What makes them so sure of themselves? Barf.'
'This is what Fox, OAN, etc. should be doing. Actually reporting the facts and substance of the various decisions and plans. It would go a long way to dispelling rumors and false stories, instead of just yelling "Fake News!" Show how fake the MSM news is and expose the hypocrisy and ignorance. '
'These are supposed to be EDUCATED Americans. But no they just repeat whatever bullshit they read off Facebook, without doing ANY research. \n\nSad. '

'I don\'t get it. Seriously this is all too weird to me. A guy says we gotta get rid of immigration, and now people are afraid of mass genocide and white supremacy and nazies are everywhere. People are so convinced they goe out of their way to organize armies and go for a hunt for these so called nazies. Are people really that easy to control ? I mean yeah there is stupid, but how can people be this stupid and unquestionning of their own beliefs ? A fucking first world country and people think they are going to be hunted and killed for being gay trans or whatever. This makes me wonder is all of history like this ? were people like Gengis Kahn, hitler or whatever evil guy just some "misunderstood" dude who got demonized for saying the wrong thing. was history always this retarded. Am i this retarded and just as brain washed for thinking libs are stupid ? this really is confusing me. I always thought we had enough intellect to be better than this. I know there are stupid people, but not like this. '

'Antifa are communists. And not the Marxist fairy in the castle type preached by dim witted academics, but the ruthless "cut your throat bash your brains in" Bolsheviks who care not one iota for political discussion.  \nThe MSM is now complicit with a actual, no holds barred, terrorist organization. This is the same media who have come out on the side of the Palestinian terrorists.  \nThe country is waking up - listen to Antifa\'s boasts about wanting to kill Nazis - knowing that they get to define who is a Nazi. Contrast that to Trumps calls for tolerance and love.  \nThe MSM has literally chosen to side with the group of people that killed more people than any other ideology (including Nazi\'s) in history. Make no mistake, Antifa would happily kill you, your family, and everyone you know. This is how communism works...  \n**Thank God every day for Trump and for him Making America Great Again!**'

'There are few things in life that I am truly passionate about. However, there is one thing that I always love to engage in a heated debate about: why New Jersey sucks. I have a list of reasons a mile long and a rebuttal to anyone’s pro-Jersey statements. Founded in 1664 from land stolen from New York, Jersey is called the “armpit of America” for a reason, and I aim to prove why that nickname is so fitting.\n\nWhy is New Jersey called “the Garden State”? Because they couldn’t fit “Oil and Petrol Refinery State” on a license plate. Wherever you go, there are refineries, oil derricks and overall filth and stench. While it is true that gas prices in New Jersey are delightfully low, this one positive aspect is greatly offset by the fact that the entire state is one large gas station and consequently smells like fart. \n\nWhat is the difference between Jersey girls and trash? Trash gets picked up. The few places in New Jersey that are not dedicated to furthering this country’s dependence on oil are reserved for containing garbage. New Jersey has been called “New York’s garbage dump” and referred to as “a giant garbage dump with a mess of highways running through it”. There are more garbage dumps in New Jersey per square mile than any other state in the nation. It’s disgusting, both to see and to smell. Furthermore, that the smell is worsened by the people of New Jersey themselves. \n\nNew Jersey is full of wanna-be “Guidos” who regularly bathe themselves in Axe body spray under the false pretense that this will make them smell attractive. Actually, it makes them repulsive. It is absolutely hysterical to observe these guys who think they are the hottest thing since sliced bread. The standard uniform for one of these “bros” consists of tight jeans (often with fancy stitching and/or embroidery) and a striped blue button-down dress shirt with the collar “popped”. Since when did tanning, tweezing eyebrows, full-body waxing, hair that resembles the aftermath of sticking one’s finger in an electrical socket and wearing skin-tight women’s tank tops and lip gloss become “manly”? These people should be sterilized...\n\nAfter having witnessed such horrifying sights, the standard sane response is to want to flee the state as quickly as possible. However, yet again New Jersey unfailingly demonstrates its suckyness to anyone unfortunate enough to be trapped within its state borders.\n\nMore than likely you’ll get lost as you try to leave, due to the lack of signage and crappy planning of the roads and highways. To make matters worse, left and U-turns are prohibited at most intersections! New Jersey loves its jug handles, forcing drivers to turn right before they can turn left. The argument for this is that the jug handles improve safety by decreasing intersection accidents, but I think they are unnecessary. A left turn lane with a left turn only signal on the traffic light would be sufficient, instead of using up all that extra land. In reality, these jug handles can cause more accidents. What happens when someone is driving along, expecting to turn left but instead at the last minute realizes that they have to get all the way over to the right lane? Accidents and road rage from the annoyance and aggravation, that’s what happens. It is ironic that despite their “safety conscious” infrastructure, New Jersey also has the highest auto insurance rates in the country due to frequent accidents and overall crappy drivers.\n\nDuring your incarceration in New Jersey, you’ll most likely eventually have to stop for gas. Here again more Jersey brilliance is encountered: it’s illegal to pump your own gas. That’s right, self-service is a crime. While it is understood that this was done to create jobs, the least Jersey could have done was to ensure that these individuals were qualified to fuel a car. Apparently when asked to “fill it up with 93-octane” they interpret this as exactly the same as asking for a tank full of 87. I’ve given up on expecting the gas station attendants to actually listen and comprehend the English language, so now I keep a careful eye on these screw-ups to ensure I get what I ask for. How lovely it is that New Jersey has made it necessary for consumers to supervise them to make sure they actually do their remedial job correctly.\n\nFurthermore, once you actually find your way out of the Garbage State and can practically taste the wonderful freedom of escape, you get yet another slap in the face. For the privilege of leaving New Jersey, you are charged a toll! That’s right; you are actually required to have to pay to leave. Every exit, every road and every bridge that leaves NJ is sweetened by the process of handing over your hard-earned money.\n\nNow, you’d assume that this money was being put to good use, but this would be incorrect. Instead of solving problems that plague the state via toll collections, or possibly repairing some of the poorly integrated roads or replacing jughandles, New Jersey continues to sink to a new level of moral and ethical lowness. Per capita, New Jersey is the richest state in the country (with a lot of that money being mafia-related), but the city of Camden is the poorest in the nation with the highest murder and crime rates as well. They should use some of this money to solve these types of problems, but they don’t, because New Jersey sucks.\n\n“Jersey Pride” is another thing that really bothers me. New Jersey has nothing to be proud about, except its stench. They’re just jealous that they aren’t as good or as pretty as New York. Proud New Jersey inhabitants often ramble on about why they love their state so much, but since their accents are so painful to listen to, their flawed logic falls on deaf ears. Since when has “Jersey” been spelled “Joisey”?\n\nAdditionally, Jersey steals. The Jets and the Giants home stadium is located in New Jersey, but they are both New York teams! Even worse is that New Jersey claims to own the Statue of Liberty. The Statue is located on Liberty Island, which is in New York, but due to the fact it is located in close proximity to Jersey City, NJ, they consider it theirs. Thieves I say, blatant thieves.\n\nLastly, after all of these headaches from dealing with the idiocy that is New Jersey, it would only make sense that you’d want to enjoy a drink or a beer to relax and de-stress. If you want to do that on Sunday though, you’re out of luck. That’s right, no alcohol sales on Sunday. This is an absolute travesty, especially during football season. How can they expect sports fans to truly enjoy their games? Damn Jersey...\n\nIn conclusion, I feel there is strong evidence as to why you should hate New Jersey. The state, and most of the people living there, are complete wastes of space. It’s smelly and gross and completely illogical. The state dance is the square dance. I think that New Jersey sucks, and you should too. '

"Well this will be used in North Korea as propaganda. One day I fell into a grouping of videos about North Korea escapees. These people were discussing how N.Korea has since the 1950's instilled a true and absolute hatred into their citizenry of America. America is the aggressor. America wants to kill all of North Korea because NK is the best nation on Earth.  NK tells their people that SK is nothing but a wasteland, a cesspool. \n\nThe cellphones have been smuggled in and N Koreans are wising up, which is why Kim Jung Un is so horrid compared to even his father and grandfather. He exerts control by murder. If a parent and child escape, Kim Jung Un kills the other siblings, other spouse, all the grandparents, and immediate cousins. It is brutal. \n\nThe NK escapees also mention how the little short shit has had plastic surgery to look like his grandfather. Wears gramps hairstyle, glasses, got fatter like gramps in hopes of creating the same deity status as gramps with the NK population. You got the sense from those interviewed that they are tired and wore out for being lied to. \n\nBut the America as aggressor and changing that perception is the biggest red pill that is inserted rectally due to this being almost DNA hardwired hatred."

And yet your sat there telling me Donald Trump is going to cause world war 3"\n\nFuck off and get your head out of your arse. Concentrate on the real threat. Donald Trump is trying to protect his country as any president would. The bigger problems are mass migration in Europe, even bill Gates stressed this recently. Acid attacks and the fact Germany wants to rule the EU, they might have lost 2 world wars but to look at them you wouldn\'t think so'

WE ARE NO LONGER A GROUP THAT WILL BE SILENCED AND DISCRIMINATED AGAINST AND WILL NOT STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED PRACTICE OF COWARDICE & FACISM. BE CAUTIOUS!'
"shadow banning is a form of fraud,  without question, and the courts will deem it illegal.\n\nTwitter does not notify you that you've been shadow-banned.    And yet when they shadow ban you,  they reduce your access to their services - at the same time they are still telling you that these services are available to you.    People invest a lot of time and money into what they put out through Twitter.   Being shadow banned is a huge loss of revenue for them.    The deception is the key.     \n\nI expect the law will come down hard on Twitter over this..  not to mention the public backlash once the practice becomes common knowledge.   Long term they just can't survive if they don't maintain a non-partial image.   Eventually someone else will depose them."
"It's a big problem.  Twitter/Facebook/YouTube all have algorithms that limit conservative content from being seen.  They all claim these algorithms are meant to stop hate speech and abuse, which gives them cover as they've been extremely aggressive at going after conservatives and they do it in clever ways so that it can be hard or impossible to know exactly what is going on.  It started with Milo and lot of people didn't care so they just targeted more and more people."

"Where in Twitter's rules does it say they censor all right leaning political posts? It doesn't -- but it should. If Twitter changes it's TOS to include that -- so that it's crystal clear for all users, I think no legal argument could be made as to their shadowban policy. Hell, even right here on the Donald, it's crystal clear in the rules that we don't tolerate non-supporters of Trump."

'Shadow banning ?? But they said Trump couldn’t ban anyone due to “freedom of speech”\n\n'
'You know I have a sneaking suspicion Facebook does a similar thing. Im not sure if there is a name for it, because it\'s not technically "shadow banning", but it\'s more along the lines of "purposely keeping groups of people within a bubble, so as to create an echo chamber, thereby halting the spread of cancerous conservative speak"...."bubble banning?" Lol. Shit I hope I didn\'t just give Reddit an new idea. Then again, at the end of the day, the people will always have their say, even if it means abandoning all of the "myspace" social media for a new version somewhere else. The control of the flow of information is not a monopoly and there will always be workarounds.\n\nAlso I am also most certainly on some sort of special black list there (facebook), the last time I got banned, it happened within five seconds of hitting the "post" button....it\'s almost as if certain people become marked "in this case, le ebil Nazi conservitive speak", and there post goes directly to the "good guy zuckerberg army of free speech suppression"\n\nWho knows probably this post will get me banned here, I\'m not at all active so no big deal, I get banned from 4chan bitches!!! The funny thing is tho, nobody notices all of the illegal activities I talk about here (reddit) having to do with drugs and whatnot. But God forbid I mention evil Trump Nazi. This is the liberal destruction of America. And I also am caught up in it\'s death grip, but will continue to fight on it\'s behalf wherever I\'m not banned from on that particular day.'

'Ironically, largely probably BECAUSE of the negative coverage because the anti-American enemies could not restrain themselves from vomiting their deepest and darkest authoritarian impulses out into the world. '
"Of course it is, it has to. If nothing else people will think more of him simply because (assuming they're not full on CNN kool-aid drinkers) because they can tell the media is riding his ass about EVERYTHING. Combine that with a better economy, the promise/forecast of an even BETTER economy going forward and things like the NoKo prisoners being released today, anyone with any objectivity will see what's going on.

"There is no police station wiped out. Don't be a sensationalist. We claim fake news, but we also do fake news. A police station is attacked, [on the middle of the night](https://www.thelocal.se/20171018/helsingborg-police-station-damaged-by-blast-in-southern-sweden). Attacking a police station at night means that the killer doesn't really look to kill police, which are atypical to Muslim terrorists. The police station is damaged, but still standing fine.\n\nBut you are right on left MSM. Fox have [reported on this](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/18/swedish-police-station-damaged-in-explosion-no-injuries.html), and UK Evening Standard has also [reported on this](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/powerful-explosion-badly-damages-swedish-police-station-in-attack-against-society-a3661531.html) even though they are a bit leftist."

'Having lived in Norway for longer than I care to admit, there are a **lot** of things the media blacks out when it comes to immigrants.  Like for example, rapes, murders and robberies?  For the most part, unless it\'s extremely heinous, they leave ethnicity / immigration status out.\n\nI have so many stories to tell, but I\'ll leave you with these two:\n\nMy friend (also American), was in town running some errands.  This was in broad daylight.  He walked between two buildings (a major walk-way) where two Somali "youths" (young adults, 18-20) jumped out and tried to rob him at knife point.  Keyword: Tried.  He served in Afghanistan / Iraq and has no time for idiocy.  News next day: "Two youths rob man in daylight".\n\nI had two Norwegian friends, a couple, stand outside a bar taking a smoke.  Neither were inebriated in the slightest, just out to grab a couple of beers together and meet up with some friends.  A group of Somali\'s approach the man, ask him for a cigarette.  Not having any more, he declined them one and that\'s when they both were assaulted and placed in the hospital.  The man had a broken rib and other injuries.  News: "A drunken fight happened outside (club name) Saturday night severely injuring one".\n\nFor the last, and most fucked up:  A Middle Eastern child and a Norwegian child were playing together.  They had a disagreement where the M.E. kid ran inside crying to his dad.  The dad, mid-late 40\'s comes out side and starts beating on the Norwegian boy.  Numerous people jump in to help the boy out and to call the police.\n\nThe man wasn\'t charged with anything, he was told to go back inside and not to come out for the remainder of the day with his son.  This was witnessed by my girlfriend and her sister first hand.  Her sister was even "interviewed" by the local media.  Nothing reported on the case anywhere.\n\nMy point is:  So much happens that the little we do get to know is usually "white washed".  If more people knew the reality of what\'s going on, I think they\'d have a totally different view of immigration as a whole.'

"MSM, Dems, RINOS, & other Never-Trumpers have gone so far off the deep end. Ego prevents them from stopping. The longer they go the harder it will be to come back. I have never seen anything like this.\n\n Anyone on the other side who is reading this, please know: we will respect you for admitting that you were wrong, and that the left has gone way too far. We will accept your apology. Heck, we don't even need an apology, just come halfway back towards sanity. Please don't keep holding out. I know it's tough to admit that you were led down such a dark path. It isn't your fault. It is mostly the fault of the irresponsible MSM leading you down the road to eventual no return. It is also the fault of power-hungry amoral politicians (Hillary, Barry, McCain, Chuck, Nancy, Pocahontas, Ryan, Graham, Booker, etc.) Who are willing to go to any low for votes and power. If you keep on waiting to turn back things will continue to get worse. We are Americans. We all should get along for the good of the future generations of Americans. Take a deep breath, turn off CNN, take a month-long break from news and politics. Whatever it takes. Please, we are begging you, stop doubling down on crazy. \n\nThe current regime in Iran are dangerous and do not want peace. The Obama administration giving them pallets of cash totaling billions of dollars was a horrible idea. People like Linda Sarsour are not interested in woman's rights. She is interested in setting up an Islamist government in the West. We here at T_D do not want that. We do not want woman stoned to death, or gays thrown off of buildings. WE ARE THE GOOD SIDE! Please move back towards our end of the spectrum. Even just a little. You can still fight for socialism-lite if that's your thing, but the no-brakes full-speed rush to totalitarianism that is happening on the left is scary to me and every good-hearted American who wants the best for America *and* the world. \n\nThe rabid censorship on social media should have any sane person outraged. Don't fall for the same tricks that took down so many countries last century and led to death of millions. Communists and Nazis both came to power because of similar scenarios currently happening with our media and universities. Just say no! Or,  at the very least, slow your roll into this insanity. Let's start being rational and doing what is good for America based on logic and fairness. Don't be swayed by the false-feels they are pushing down your impressionable throats. Stop the insanity."
"CBC in Canada as well is claiming it is due to expensive gas and Trump's provocations. Disclosure, I'm not a huge Trump supporter as I agree with some but not all of his policies. The level of bullshit the MSM globally is coming up with to attack him is insane. We're talking about a religious dictatorship that has been oppressing people for decades and people in the streets in Iran shouting for a secular government due to the oppressive nature of Islam. World policy is becoming reactive to Trump, it's embarrassing and will just lead to a further decay in Western society. "

But somehow this is a bad thing because the left is jealous on Trump achievements in North Korea. I can't believe people still takes the left seriously.

'Dems got their bluff called. They are fucked now.'
"Trump offered 1.8 million illegal aliens a reprieve from deportation and a pathway to citizenship, and the Dems turned their noses up at it because it would have required funding for border security as part of the bargain. Proving that Democrats don't actually care about the ~2 million illegal aliens already in the country; what's more import to them are the untold millions of Democrat-voting illegals-to-be who haven't hopped the border yet."
"Last but not least, the loudest of the DACA people don't care either. All they've done is bitched and protested about the deal wanting no strings attached. Shame on them, for being greedy.\n"
'Pedes, can someone please bring me upto speed on DACA? I mean I already died from withdrawing from the Paris Accord and then was revived and murdered again by the tax cuts.\n\nWill ending DACA kill me again? Thanks for help.'
"As a Tax paying Business owner who employs Americans and as a DACA recipient my self, the dems really threw me under the bus I don't know any DACA recipient who would vote democratic if they become a citizen its not gonna happen. They have a chance to help us and President Trump wants to personally help us become legal but democrats are too anti Trump even for something they always said they wanted. I'm sick to my stomach over the actions of the dems"
'Forgive my ignorance, but I thought the Dems desperately wanted it so they could keep the vote of the illegals. What exactly will they draw votes from in 2020? Or are they looking into completely illegal ways to puff up their vote count?'
'They don’t want a deal.  They want the screaming of women and wailing of children.  They want the suicides and self harm, the last stands and shootouts,  all the while with the MSM taking directions and racing from one event to the next to catch it all on film.  My country has faced similar tactics with fake refugees.  Once deported, the DACAs will scream and hunger strike and self harm at the chain link fence for the cameras.  They will setup a tent city at the border and never leave, and seek some kind of one of a kind special status with the UN.  Crime will be high as they prey one another and the local criminal element moves in to take advantage of them.  Mexican atrocities will take place in the shadow of the wall and they will blame no one but the U.S'
"Let's start thinking about what to do with these people after they are deported back to their homes.   For the DACAs who renounce and disavow illegal immigration, there should be an assistance aide program to help them get them on their feet.   For the DACAs who bold face advocate illegal immigration, we should treat them as war criminals/invaders.  "
'The deadline is here, time to deport them because the Dems failed to come to the table. Democrats in the senate need to learn to fear this president so they never blow him off like this again.'
"Lemme get this straight...\n\nDACA is a safety net for people who were brought here as kids with illegal parents. There is currently no path to citizenship (what about the military?) so these folks are stuck.\n\nMr. Trump wants to either deport or create a pathway to citizenship for these people, but the Dems don't want to help?\n\nIf that's the jist of things, then what the fuck?? *Kids* were being fucked over by short-sighted policy and now there's nothing they can do besides leave the US. And the Dems don't want to do anything because 1) they hate Trump and 2) they tell the DACA kids they'll provide a pathway to garner votes. Now when they're being told to put money where mouth is they don't want anything to do with it."
'Trump is pushing for DACA and the democrats are fighting it.\n\nWhat the hell kind of timeline is this anyway?'
"Of course they don't care. They were simply grandstanding for some 2018 mid term votes. They realized that DACA doesn't really motivate LEGAL VOTING latinos, only stir up the small vocal minority of white students. "
"The rats don't care about the illegal they only use them as a political weapon to get votes. Remember when President Obama held literally all the power and they didn't get shit done for the illegal. I'm telling you folks the rats don't GIVE a shit about anyone except for their dam pockets. "

Beliefs which ...basically define people as the useful idiots that we\'ve been saying they were for over a year ( and which explains why feminists defend muslims btw.)

Following heavy bombing raids against the North Vietnamese port city of Hai Phong at the end of the Vietnam War, he participated in protest rallies targeting the United States Embassy in Oslo. On at least one occasion embassy windows were broken by stone-throwing protesters. Several of Stoltenberg's friends were arrested by the police after these events.\n\nKnowing that the head of NATO is sympathetic to communism and an anti-US protestor makes this all the better!"
"WTF!!! That there is 14 hours of jet lag I'm-about-to-bring-the-hammer power!  Wow!  Almost uncomfortable to watch how Alpha he is in that setting.  Complete dominance.  John Kelly (love him) was uncomfortable.  Mike Pompeo?  Uncomfortable.  That woman sitting to the right of the President?  Uncomfortable.  THE GERMANS!???  Fuck-all, they were terrified.  Look, when you negotiate and are being taken advantage of you have to cut-the-crap.  Trump does just that.  Damn.  That was powerfully uncomfortable but alpha and Presidential as fuck."
'Damn, I love this magnificent bastard!! The leftist REEEEeeeing all over social media that Trump is "embarrassing us and alienating our allies at the NATO breakfast!" Sorry, soy sipping cucks but I have to break the news that we have a no nonsense, straight talking America First President now. We\'re America, Bitch! '
'I think he just killed NATO. '
"OMG. \n\nI honestly dont understand how liberals hate this man. \n\nHe is literally shining a light on all the hypocritical BS that the rest of the world does to our nation. It's not as if trade deficits or NATO spending is a Republican or Democrat only issue. It effects all of us. \n\nI never respected Trump more than after seeing this video. \n\nSay what you will about his approach or tact but the man gives a fuck about America, all of America, and its plain as fucking day to see."

"About damn time they're admitting!  Even if Manafort was acting as an illegal foreign agent for the Russians before he was hired to be Trump's campaign manager, that still means they put a wiretapp on Trump."
"What a despicable situation MSM is right now. This man was discredited ages ago. He's still spewing shit on TV, and MSM is still swallowing it like pathetic little useful idiots. What absurd reality do those people actually live in?"
'From what I can recall, Trump\'s initial claim in the tweet that everyone got all butthurt over was that ***Trump Tower*** had been wiretapped - not Trump himself personally. Liberals keep going back on this, claiming that even though manafort was wiretapped, Trump was still wrong because he said that he was personally wiretapped.\n\nWell, that\'s bullshit - Trump didn\'t say that. He said Trump Tower. And the news about manafort being wiretapped has indicated that he was wiretapped at his office in - wait for it - **Trump Tower**.\n\nSo in my mind, it\'s not that we\'re "close" to Trump being proven right. He already has been proven right. Now we\'re just discussing the extent to which he was right.'

They blacklisted him. He would get like 2nd or 3rd place in those town hall Caucasus or whatever and they would only mention who got 1st and 4th and just skip him. \n\nI was in Florida at the time and remember driving to Miami for work. I saw Ron Paul banners and signs ALL the way down I-95. \n\nI am almost convinced it was the audit the fed stuff that did this too him. JFK wanted to take away power from the Fed Reserve by using those silver notes and then was killed. \n\nThe first thing LBJ did when he came in was reverse that. Could be a conspiracy but seems interesting to me. \n\nRegardless, Ron Paul was deemed a threat to somebody and they blacklisted the crap out of him. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/tjuUWr9vaXo\n\nGo RAND 2024!\n\n\n'

The neocons want Trump to start a war...ANYWHERE sooo bad, SO bad.  you can just see and feel it.  They are upset that he didn\'t invade Syria when he did his precision strikes.  I told everybody those strikes were meant to send a clear message.  "this is my line and don\'t you fucking DARE cross it. PEROD or I will strike harder with even MORE precision every time you go this far!"  It was to send a clear message to those other mother fuckers that want to be evil to people or that want to threaten the us or allied countries.  They will think to themselves "my god..he actually did it o.o umm...guys? you wanna rethink our strategy about threatening the united states now that he\'s in there? :O " \n\nTrump did what he needed to do in Syria. Mostly that was to send a clear message "don\'t fuck with me or push me too far", as well as beating the shit out of ISIS, which is pretty much dismantled now.  why? because their funds are totally stripped and cut off. The CIA has been figured out and they can\'t get away with it anymore.  Trump did NOT take the bait at all about "invading" a country to start a war.  will skirmishes and shit that needs to get handled happen? sure, of course they will! But he will never get us into a full blown war.  That is why our country continues to do so well.  He is focusing mostly all of his efforts on the united states. As it should be.'

Not only were hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed their homes, schools, hospitals, doctor\'s offices, libraries, museums, universities, the whole culture.    The neo-cons gleefully wiped out the future for every Iraq child who managed to live though their mindless carnage.  The people of Iraq spent generations holding back Iran and defending their culture and Independence future and we (no matter how much I screamed and hated it, I still have to write "we") woke up one morning and decided to smash it to smithereens.\n\nThat is way they have a deep state, to hide their ugly, ugly actions.   If we don\'t know about them, we can\'t stop them, **and the reality THEY HATE THE MOST IS - if we find out about them we can stop them, we can do that, we morons in fly-over country can take their little spy glasses away from them and sit them in the corner.**   And then who/what are they but powerless TRAITORS.\n\nI think one of the reasons they are so mad is because President Trump stiff-armed them out of his meeting.   They want to know everything that is going on so that they can hatch their plans and set their booby traps.\n\nWhen I think of neocons I can\'t help but fondly review this early internet memory:  A long time ago when the internet was still young, the smug, entitled neocon, Bill Kristol, who held a way too high opinion of himself bethought himself to be a blogger.   It was one of those precious internet moments we see illustrated here now and again - "this is how he sees himself; this is how he really is".  The abecedarian, Kristol thought to be hailed as the grue of the internet, a pedagogue, a preceptor, but our wondrous progenitors on the internet burst out laughing. (I used [Dictionary.com](https://Dictionary.com) for synonyms).\n\nAnyway, I don\'t know how long he spent under his bed but when he crawled out he condemned the whole internet as a "Seething swamp" and vowed he would never risk reality hitting him in the face ever again.'

'AMEN. As soon as the reason for our invasion went from “Weapons of mass destruction” to “Making Iraq Free for Democracy” I knew that we had been duped and we were screwed! The Bushes and war mongers on both sides HATE Trump for pointing this out. He’s screwing with their “legacy”. '

It entirely fucked and destabilized an already bloody region into total chaos. "

It includes nifty payments which ranged from  $100K to $30mil for elites and immunity for Un.\n\n> Apart from $30 million, up to $23.3 billion would be paid in total to the families of those elite officials who wield power in Pyongyang. Shepherd notes that the top ten families would receive $30 million each, and the top thousand families would get $5 million.\n\n> In the hermit state, there are more than 11,000 elite officials, including army generals and chief officers. A sum of at least $1 million will be given to these officials while the next tier of 50,000 elites would be paid between $100,000 and $500,000.'

The entire NK air force would be smoldering wreckage within the first three days.The NK army would have pushed to the Pusan Perimeter before they ran out of gas, and every base and installation north of it would have been destroyed with all or most personnel killed. Then, counter-punch from us, and within three to six months it would be all over. North Korea would be gone. History. (Much more involved here, with China, etc, but for the sake of brevity)\n\nSoft Landing was better, but still pretty bad. A refugee crisis of epic proportions would have flooded the Chinese border, and people would have even braved the DMZ, getting blown up and machine-gunned by their own army. A limited military skirmish would be inevitable, but more than likely a general or two would start a coup in the face of the crisis and NK would dissolve into a factional civil war of some kind. The end result would be the same though: NK would be finished.\n\n**This development** however is something entirely different. It is something we never, ever, EVER imagined would happen: that North Korea would end the war and disarm. I mean, MY GOD we never imagined this would be possible. And its the end of North Korea, twenty, thirty years from now or even sooner, because the Hermit Kingdom can only exist in a state of total secrecy. Their population is so isolated, they literally live in 1950s conditions. And yet, bit by bit, a view of the real world is filtering in drop by drop. The damage is irreversable to the Kim regime. **THIS IS NOT AN 'END TO THE WAR.' THIS IS A SURRENDER.**\n\nNow, don't get me wrong. North Korea is still going to be around for a while. The PTB have to figure out what the next move is, and the next move is tranferring their ill-gotten-gains offshore and setting up a safe haven for their bug-out. They're probably pissing themselves though because they know that no matter where they go, they're dog meat. But to stay inside the gulag that they created, and having THEIR VICTIMS, THE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE have them would be infinitely worse. Think [Nicolae Ceausecu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDRXGiYRsw) and his bitch wife, times 100.\n\nThis is a slow-moving collapse in the making, as more and more South Korean (western) culture filters north. This is the best possible scenario that could have happened, imo, and without a shot fired.\n\nThis is not a ceremonial move. This is **TOTAL FUCKING VICTORY**."

"After watching Kelly's speech yesterday, i was incredibly sad. But after that a wave of intense anger washed over me. Anger that anyone would politicize something like this is beyond comprehension. The progressives have gone too far and they dont even see it. They were quick to get in their media channels immediately afterwards to criticize and critique Kelly without even listening to what he had to say. I dont see how we as a country are ever going to be able to recover from this point here. I cant see a single situation where half of our country will begin to love their country again. "

She's going to remember that you were there, and that's all that matters. \n\nThese families are in a whirlwind of emotion and grief. At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter exactly what President Trump tells these families. All that matters is that he was there for them, and that's what they'll remember most. "

They\'ll stoop to ANY fucking level to make this man look bad, when all he\'s doing is trying to do right by everyone.\n\nFUCK this whole "controversy," and let\'s stop making threads about it already.

"The reason why they want to compare Trump to Hitler is much more nuanced. It is because they want to live in a fantasy  where Trump is a cruel dictator and they are brave,liberal warriors who are fighting against him and protecting minorities.

"I got downvoted heavily in that thread for asking why there was such a focus on the anti-semitism of the Nazis, when the Holocaust was actually Plan B and many more slavs were murdered than Jews. The Nazis original plan was to mass murder the Slavs to make way for Germanic settlers. It was only when this failed that Hitler started shipping the Jews out of the ghettos. Without the Russian pushback we'd be talking about the genocide of every slavic person as far as the Ural mountains. Jews were higher up on the Nazi's racial grouping than the slavs were. "

'reminder\n\nMarch 9:\n\n> Clapper: "We did not include any evidence in our report, and I say, ‘our,’ that\'s NSA, **FBI** and CIA, with my office, the Director of National Intelligence, that had anything, that had any reflection of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. There was no evidence of that included in our report."\n\nMarch 20 Comey testified for the first time that there is a Russia/campaign  investigation. Clapper said nothing, no tweet, no interview. then May 8:\n\n> Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., quoted Clapper’s exchange on Meet The Press in a May 8 Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and asked if it was still accurate. **Clapper responded, "It is."**\n\nThen suddenly after Comey is fired a week later Clapper re-appears and testifies that  **he never knew about the FBI investigatio**n, Comey didn\'t tell him and that\'s normal. They issued a joint report on Russia interference, he is the director of national intelligence - but he had **no idea** about the FBI investigation going on since June 2016. Clapper heard about for the first time March 20 - then didn\'t say anything about it, then testified under oath  May 8 that his statement of no collusion is still accurate... only NOW he finally remembered this detail. \n\nThen he gets trotted out on like 5 different Sunday morning talk shows and repeats the same prepared statement, that "No evidence of collusion" actually means "FBI never told be about their Russia investigation when we released our joint report on the Russia investigation. I found out March 20 and decided to not say anything till mid-May".\n\nIt\'s UNREAL that the former Intelligence Director just takes orders from the DNC and reads out crap that they told to say. He expects us to believe the "never knew about the investigation" narrative - which only appears after Comey is fired - and the entire media runs with the story uncritically.\n\nand of course now he\'s back again giving interviews with more talking points. does he get paid for this I wonder, is is he just that politically biased. either way, this is what Trump has to deal with in his own government.'

Nazi scum only came out of the woodwork because they feel emboldened, not by Trump, but by BLM and antifa. They\'ve lain low for a while now, then they see equally repugnant groups out there and think, "well I guess it\'s okay to do this in public again." \n\nAs for the statues themselves, I think it\'s a failure of our educational system that people think they represent racism or what have you. Monuments represent soldiers who died fighting for their country and families, nearly all of which who did not have slaves. We are a bellicose country with a martial history, we tend to honor soldiers no matter who they fought for. Look at how Rommel is admired in the West. Some of the Confederate victories are studied around the world as excellent examples of a smaller army defeating a larger one. The monuments also represent our country\'s failure, morally and diplomatically. Something that should be in the forefront of our minds right now, given all the civil strife; a warning of what can happen.\n\n'

'Donald, tell them the changes that must be made. They will not figure it out.\n\nEDIT: My suggestions:\n\n- Ensure settling citizens have an interest in assimilating into the host country’s culture. Anything other than this, is a recipe for conflict. “Immigration without assimilation is invasion.”\n\n- Slow down incoming waves of refugees. Not all “refugees” are actually refugees in the traditional sense. In WWII, there were Jewish refugees denied from western countries who were sent back to places where they were killed. That risk doesn’t exist for 99.9% of people claiming refugee status. Economic “refugees” are immigrants, not refugees.\n\n- Provide logistical and financial aid to struggling countries, give opportunities for people to make their homelands safer and more prosperous. (This can be done through investment and business dealings, it doesn’t NEED to be charity.) Why? Big movements of immigrants hurts everyone. The home country suffers from the loss of well-intentioned people, only bad actors remain, problems get worse, and more people leave. It’s a negative feedback loop. And the new host country suffers from the weight of supporting huge amounts of people, and suffers from the clash of cultures that do not cleanly mesh in a single society.\n\n- Support and amplify the voices of reformers within Islam. \n\n- Deport any immigrant that commits a crime, from littering to murder. Deport any immigrant that rallies against the host country’s values. Meaning any immigrant in marches for the implementation of sharia — OUT NOW. If you want to take this a step further (maybe too far), deport immediate family too.\n\n- Give more refugees TEMPORARY stay, vs. limitless stay. \n\n- End or limit chain migration.\n\n- Promote host culture, host language, host history. Keep street signs in native language. \n\n- Problematic areas must be reset. Absolutely no ghettos, no go-zones. Attempt peacefully to restore order, anyone who uses violence in response, arrested and deported.'

Until you do that this will never change and will just increase in frequency.

You will see them often on MSM, they aren "experts", typically from the universities, who are brought onto the show to tell us all how we need to change our culture and our way of life. They are the ones who tell the schools to push the gender bender nonsense on children. They are the ones who sit back and brainstorm ways to make communism "hip and cool" for the youth. They are the ones who probably created the whole "Trump is a Nazi" talking point that was circulated to every media outlet and artificially tending on social media.\n\nEdit 2: And I would be willing to bet anything that social engineers are the ones who pushed this "Trump throws brown babies in concentration camps" bullshit. Notice how the story broke big one day, then suddenly the leftist media all deleted their posts because it got called out that Obama was doing that... Then 2 days later the same story is back full-force, and they just conveniently ignore the part about the pics being from 2014? Why would they bring back the same story after such a massive fail 2 days ago? Because someone TOLD THEM TO push it. They pulled back at first, they said "man we can\'t do that. This will never work, it\'s too obviously bullshit". But the social engineers said do it anyway. "Ignore the facts and just push the fucking story.

The only way out Is when ya keel over. \n\nAND, Mueller totally fucked Manafort today because he was led to believe based on known information, his money concerns were Ukrainian and nothing with Russia so it should be dropped.

Rod Rosenstein told me last August I could.” \n\nNo his defense has just wasted value time to prepare a defense. \n\nI bet technically Trump isn’t a target..

'So let me get this straight. It appears People in the FBI colluded with Fusion GPS to get dirt on candidate Trump (fabricated dirt no less) because Fusion GPS employed the spouse of at least 1 FBI agent. Fusion GPS then offered dirt to Donald Trump Jr on HRC which Donald Trump Jr turned down because he said it wasn’t believable.  So Fusion GPS gets their “dirt” on DJT to another FBI agent who then used the fabricated dirt to obtain a FISA warrant to investigate DJT.  This same FBI agent was the lead investigator on the HRC email criminal activity and the one who changed Comey’s wording in the written statement on HRC and encouraged no charges for HRC. This same agent (and the other agent whose spouse worked for Fusion GPS) were both “selected” onto Mueller’s team to investigate DJT and Russian collusion. And the Judge presiding in the Michael Flynn case resulting from the DJT investigation was the same Judge that issued the FISA warrant based on the fabricated dirt on DJT - although the charges against Flynn were not colluding with Russia.  And on top of that McCabe, the #2 at the FBI, his spouse has received over $600,000.00 from HRC backed organizations. So now the Judge has to recuse himself, one agent has already been removed from Mueller’s team, and it would seem criminal prosecution would be forthcoming. Who in their right mind could argue that the FBI is not in tatters?  Democracy is dying at the hands of the FBI. The people in power better get this right or there will be Hell to pay. \n\nEdit:  how is this not the equivalent of planting evidence?  \n\nEdit2:  I might have said FBI agent when I should have set deputy attorney general.

'So how the hell is he still investigating. What the actual fuck.'
'LMFAOOOO FUCK YOU /R/POLITICS 🤣🤣🤣'
'wow thats might generous of treasonous soft coup co-conspirator Mueller.\n\nConsidering he CANT indict him.\n\nHe will just do what he\'s been doing, making noise, leaking to the press, viciously attacking any and all Trump associates, and then dump a "we know he obstructed and suspect all kinds of other stuff, but cant prove it because he wouldnt sit for an interview" file to Congress, with a lot of fanfare and press conference the disgusting resist media will blare on volume 11, **all so Congress has the excuse they have DESPERATELY been waiting for to impeach**\n\nThat is and was always the game.\n\n*and its all irrelevant and for show* - the only thing that matters is the mid terms anyway.  If the American public allows the House to become majority Dem+RINO, impeachment is automatic. If Senate becomes 2/3 Dem+RINO (and in both cases RINO also includes closet NeverTrumper traitors), removal is also automatic.\n\n**the excuses really are sideshows**'
'These people will never be happy. What a miserable subsistence. '
'What blows my mind the most is that this is no different than the media has been acting for 50 years, yet Trump is *literally* the first president/candidate to mention it.  He says "Fake News", we all know what he means, but the normies lose their fucking minds because they have never had the veil pulled back.  We have been screaming at Republicans to do exactly this for decades because it\'s a slam dunk issue, but none of them ever did.'
'WTF I HATE DENUCLEARIZATION AND PEACE TALKS NOW REEEEEEEEEEEEEE'
'They were sooo pissed off when Trump continued the planned military operations in SK. They were saying we need to stop if we want peace. Now they want military operations back! Pathetic!\n\nOh and of course the line now is “the deal they signed is just a piece of paper. Trump gave up so much by pulling out military operations for a worthless piece of paper”.... sooo when it comes to denuclearization it’s “just a piece of paper” but when it comes to ceasing military operations apparently it’s set in stone and we can never turn back? Get fucked, leftist goons. We could pull our entire military operations out of SK today and fly them all back by tomorrow if we change our minds. \n\nThe biggest question is WHY THE FUCK HAS THIS BECOME A PARTISAN ISSUE. DONT WE ALL WANT PEACE?! Why can’t for ONCE we just rally behind America and get peace? We can have partisan fights all we want on taxes or borders, but this is peace, we shouldn’t be fighting ourselves over this. Fucking democrats want war just to make Trump look bad. You don’t even have to rally behind Trump, just rally behind America and peace, that’s it. Stop making every fucking thing a partisan issue you have to “win”'

He is literally surrounded by complete scumbags every day of his life. \n\nYou can hear Trump’s frustration with this nonsense in the tone of all of his tweets. He is clearly angry and astonished that he can’t completely expose these swamp-cunts. Especially when the proof they are weasels is so apparent.'
'Can we talk about the fact that President Trump has just done one of the greatest things any president has done which is bring peace and all the leftist democrats can say is "let\'s crash the economy and start war with NK just so we can make Trump look bad and retake the white house!". \n\nSeriously, should we be doing something about these idiots advocating for a goddamn war?'

Did you know about Hillary Clinton's private email server?  \n\n2. Did/do you know of anyone else using a private email to conduct government business on?  \n\n3. Have you ever used a private email server to conduct government business on?  \n\nHillary's email was apparently an open secret, meaning all the higher ups were accomplices to a crime, and likely exchanged emails with her. If Trump makes everyone answer these questions in a sworn statement, he will have all he needs to fire Rosenstein, and all the other swamp rats."
"And furthermore, no one is disputing what was said in those emails. They fucked themselves with their own words.\n\nIf Trump shouldn't have any expectations for a private conversation with Billy Bush, then neither should these assholes. \n\nThose emails speak for themselves; the DNC rigged the election to favor Hillary at the expense of Sanders, and the voters rightly punished her for it."

If we don't get our shit together we will lose.  Dems will do literally anything to win...even shoot republicans on a ball field.  3)  Activism isn't done on The_Donald.  Its done in the field. 4) Trump is always right.  Our options were Luther Strange, Mo Brooks or lose....Trump knew that."
"I don't believe Moore's accusers, but he has also said a lot of borderline racist shit in the past too. Last night the black vote was unexpectedly high, so I am guessing they turned out due to the racist stuff and not the sexual misconduct. Bannon needs to vet these people better."

I'd say it worked all too well, in terms of voter turnout, but it was hell of a close one. Conveniently too close."
'Very disappointed with AL\'s vote last night.\n\n1) Moore never had a chance, and the GOP acted against him. Remember Flake\'s donation and Shelby\'s announcement on Sunday? The press treated the accusations as fact and editorialized outside of its opinion pages when it referred to him as "accused child molester Roy Moore."\n\n2) Yet Alabama picked Moore in the primary. To pick the man and then not carry him enough to hold a seat against a liberal until 2020 is astounding. If you didn\'t like him, why didn\'t you pick Strange so at least we\'d have a stronger majority in the Senate?\n\nI hope the right choice is made in 2020. Until then, this has given the left a rallying cry. '
'So now, as a result of the uniparty\'s win last night, Crying Chuck Schumer is calling on McConnell to delay any tax reform vote until AFTER Cuck Jones is seated in the Senate.  Unbelievable.

What better way to "resist" than to deny Trump a massive win on taxes...fuck McConnell, Fuck Ryan, Fuck Flake, Fuck McCain, Fuck em all...'

Roseanna isn't even that conservative, she just didn't move left with them."

'Perceived "racism" is a higher crime than jokes about raping children.  That\'s where they are coming from.'
"Well the turnaround on Roseanne losing her show was extremely fast because she's not a leftist.  It usually takes them a bit longer to accept that a leftist has fucked up to the point where they have to cut ties.  I assume Sony will get out of this thing, it can't possibly be worth it to them, I'm sure the movie is a pile of shit that nobody would have even heard about if not for all of this."
"Even if they fire him and kill his movie right now, it took them a lot longer than it took them to kill Roseanne's wildly popular show."

'Fuck Hollywood, fuck their rapists, and fuck Yogurt DeNero.'

Blacks are absolutely at the bottom of our society now and they blame whites but we haven\'t changed except to become more bleeding heart liberal.  The brown demographic of this country is what has changed dramatically (increased and gotten more political power) and all that "diversity" has displaced the black people.  But still more complaints about whitey.  Still more insistence that all brown is on the same team for some unknown racist reason.  It\'s unbelievable.

Thanks for staying the course, Dems.\n\n(Spez:) If you live in one of these states, **SAVE ALL EVIDENCE** of allowing demonstrations to turn into war zones thanks to Soros and his buses full of ninjas throwing bottles. Elections are real and so are the consequences."
'Well, that is a very interresting point that you bring up. \n\nWhat is a domestic terorist. \n\nLet me make a mental detour here. \n\nBecause as far as I see, this is the really interresting point: \n\nThat the left are very very very intent on painting it as terrorism, as soon as a right wing guy does it, but when a left wing person does it, it\'s a mentally disturbed individual with no connection whatsoever. \n\nIf you would ask a democrat or a "new american" what a domestic terrorist is, he would most likely spout some lines about how a domestic terrorist uses hatred, and the real divide is hatred, and hate speech.... \n\nIt is actually far easier. \n\nA terrorist uses violence to get a political message through despite the overwhelming majority of people not being for it. \n\nIf you bring into hatred in, you can counter that with Hitler. Hitler was sentenced not because he hated germany, but because he loved it. It was plain to see for the judges, and they went easy on hitler. You wouldn\'t want hitler to get off easy, would you? \n\nLet that sink in. \n\nMind you, I personally do not think the antifa deserves the label terrorist. they are kids, and kids do stupid shit. for fucks sake, I wore clothing that would make me now retch. Can\'t say shit about that. \n\nThe turning point will comne when the left presses this button too far. and you get an actual conversation about domestic terrorism going. \n\nBecause what I see is far too often that the left forgets about the power of media. \n\nWhen I look at a photo of trump supporters, with all the love I am able to, I don\'t see dangerous radicals. I see a couple of goobers out. All this alpha and beta talk is fine and dandy, but at the end, what you get from a trump community  meetup looks like a couple of guys who have no idea how to show support coming along because someone promised beers in a cooler. you got your fat shirts, you got your MAGA hats, but anything in between, fuck it, as diverse as america. and, lets be fair, not particularely threatening. More like a lost family picknick full of that one side of the family that kind of lives rural. Probably would never know wheatgrass was an option in milkshakes, but would know how much you get for wheatgrass at the market. You know, goobers, probably with wood paneling on their subarus. \n\nThe left however? Antifa especially? OOOOh, same clothing, masks to their faces, weapons, martial bearing.... weapons out, paroles..... \n\nNow, I agree, purely on a technical level, it is legal to say, hey, I don\'t agree with you, and you fucking shut your mouth mister.... \n\nBut using violence? throwing of actual baloons filled with piss? beating with sticks? \n\nNow, tell me again, who advocates the use of violence against their political opponents? Openly? I mean, with all the love for antifa, are you SURE you want to have that discussion? \n\nBecause you seem to fit that standart defenition of terrorism pretty well. Not that special definition that you use, you know, the one with "priviledge + power" in it, nd so forth. But the one that says "advocates the use of violence as a political tool. ". The one that says , on wikipedia, "Terrorism, in its broadest sense, describes the use of intentionally indiscriminate violence as a means to create terror or fear, in order to achieve a political, religious or ideological aim". Violence as a tool to archieve a goal. \n\nBecause when we have this discussion, we will look at the great memes. at meme magic. at goobers sitting on PC\'s, and making more or les funny pictures. because that is 90 % of the trump base, at their best. At people who are too inept to make a torch, and have to buy tiki torches at wallmart. \n\nAnd we will look at the berkley attacks, at "smash the fash", at setting hair on fire and bring bikelocks to political demonstrations, at someone picking up a rifle and attempting to shoot senators, and so forth. \n\nWe will look at all of this, and go and use not your or my standart, but the peoples standart. Who will the people think more dangerous? a couple of goobers who are so disorganised they run to wallmart before the demonstration, and buy tiki torches? Making some memes and making people laugh? Or at the people who beat these people? Who advocate that the police should fry like bacon, who throw in windows, and set fire to barricades? \n\nBecause don\'t get me wrong. There are nutters in every corner, even amongst the goobers. I bet right now, a few nutters from the KKK are reading this. And I personally disagree with them on a fist to face level, which makes me a violent nutter too. \n\nBut if you bring up the idea of terrorism, you are not just looking at the edge cases. You are looking at the broad mass. \n\nWhich side is it again that advocates violence? smashing things? fighting on the streets? \n\nWhich side makes internet pictures? \n\nand yea, the right gets radicalised on the internet. in forums, chars, subreddits. \n\nWhere does the left get radicalised? \n\nExactly. In official media outlets, and in public publications. Politicians even. \n\nSo the right loses a subreddit, a forum, maybe even their website. \n\nThe left loses CNN, NBC, salon and so forth. \n\nThe right smilingly just makes a new forum. \n\nThe left must make a new media corporation. \n\nWhat a fair trade. That exchange surely has been beneficial and of great victory to the left. '

'Even in the case that the left asserts one Muslim terrorist does represent all Muslims and one white supremacist represents all trump voters, the latter is still dissimilar to the former and not true. The Trump supporter that stands by white supremacy is nonexistent (I have not met a single white supremacist trump supporter and all those grandstanding on TV are unverifiable, I.e. potential plants by the left), however there are many "moderate" muslims who protect, enable, and turn a blind eye to terrorism.

"Actually, it's totally fine for a Muslim to have a beer as long as they're going to die fighting for Allah very soon. Not sure if this is a Ramadan exclusive deal, but it certainly applies during Ramadan. No need to fast or abstain from loose women, no need to behave at all."

'I try really hard not to accept and swallow the black pill but this shit and the disgusting abuse of power from the deep state and obama administration going UNPUNISHED is fucking sickening.'
"Shit I remember many moons ago, I got into a discussion with a lefty on this against his claims on the Trump/Russia conspiracy. Gave a laundry list of evidence and was called a conspiritard, and that guy still hasn't gotten back to me on his evidence of Trump's collusion with Russia. And that was what? Six friggin months ago!"
'I was beginning to think it meant broad surveillence (it did too), but Trump was literally wiretapped. This was some extradimensional levels of chess going on here.\n\nEdit: Misspell and quote wiretapp, to get the media in a frenzy over what the correct definition was. They continued to harass Trump who was telling the complete truth. We find out all the illegal spying the Obama admin did. Obamagate>Ricegate>Comeygate etc. Nunes gets lambasted for trying to find out the truth about said unmasking. Later down the line, today, we find out it was the complete truth.'
"WHO THE FUCK IS GOING TO PRISON?! SOMEONE NEEDS TO TELL ME WHO THE FUCK IS GOING TO GODDAM PRISON. I'M SO SICK OF THESE FUCKERS DOING WHATEVER THEY WANT! "
'redacted is literally full of WTF I love wiretapping now and Even if trump was right now he is fucked lawlsbawlz and obama didnt directly do it so he is still wrong reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee'
'Is it just me, or does it seem like we are getting some really big events unfolding? Not just the swamp political intrigue and scandalous revelations of TPTB, but the engineered conflicts coming to a head, discrediting of MSM and even earth changes/natural disasters. Real talk, I sense we are reaching a very critical juncture for **all** of humanity.'
'Does anyone else think Trump and his campaign team, knowing they were being wiretapped, used it to their advantage? Perhaps feeding them false information?\n\nFunny how Hillary all of a sudden decided to go campaign in Texas of all states. Ignoring Wisconsin, Michigan Pennsylvania etc...\n\nI think they deceived her with false "inside polling" numbers showing how badly Trump was losing to her and if she campaigned in Texas he would lose that state too.\n\nTrump had to be playing them the whole campaign, simply brilliant. LOL!\n'
"Fucking charge them and throw their asses in jail! I'm so tired of these corrupt people getting caught and then nothing happens to them. Not even a slap on the wrist."
"Wait, so the people who are accusing of us of colluding with Russians actually used something out of the KGB handbook, I'm shocked (I'm not)."
'Mr. Attorney General, WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU TAKING SO DAMN SLOW TO START AND PROSECUTING THESE FUCKERS? WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?'
'dumb ass libs lie again and get exposed again'
'So, the FBI and DOJ now has tapes of all manaforts conversations.  Private conversations.  They will call every Trump admin person before the committee, dare them to not tell the whole truth, and then indict them.  This is the most fucked up thing ive ever seen.  WHEN ARE WE GOING TO RIOT TO DEMAND JUSTICE!'
' But he was still wrong to say it because there was no way he could know!!!!'
'Ehhh...are there any other sources besides Breitbart for this? There are a couple people whose faces I want to shove this in, but you know...using Breitbart will get an automatic "Fake News" response.\n\nThe probably a hypocrite if I try to use the CNN one.'
'Anything that is going to be "punished" has to be debated and unearthed first. \n\nTrump makes seemingly wild accusations, big debate, facts come out, more ridiculous lies. That\'s the pattern. If he had thrown the entire outgoing administration in prison on day 1 you don\'t think that would be problematic? Chill'
'It is clear that the left is willing to abandon ethics and the law of the land in order to destroy Trump regardless of the repercussions. These manufactured outrage over the bullshit that was passed down by previous administrations is a clear example that we can never let another lefty get in power again.'
"This is heartbreaking.  That poor woman, I couldn't imagine."
"These are the heart breaking stories Americans SHOULD BE outraged about. Certainly not the picture of a crying child whose broodmare (,she doesn't qualify to be called a mother) took her from her father, left him with 3 other kids, and paid $6k to a coyote to come here. But the braying jackass leftists don't want to hear the truth."
"Fuck you, liberals.\n\nI know I said it and meant it after you let Kate Steinle's killer off the hook. But goddamned if I don't despise you people a little more every day. "
"The Left wants these families to die along with their dead family members because they won't vote for them. Leftist poutrage, never fall for it."
'I was fighting tears the whole event. Thank god for Trump giving those parents a voice. I know I would be insane right now if my child DIED (following laws to keep him safe)  and the media covers parents who are TEMPORARILY SEPARATED (by the fault of the illegal parents even!)'
'Sickening. An illegal person in this country/sanctuary will not just hide. They will drive impaired, murder, rape and ignore the IRS as they move dollars out of America. \n\nThis is not Rocket Science. You can become a US citizen. If you are here illegally, you will be removed. \n\nDone. Simple.'
"When the left tries to say that illegals don't commit crime more than citizens, let's forget that is a lie.  What they are really saying is they want to gamble with you and your families lives by bringing people into the US that wouldn't otherwise be here.   We give people citizenship because we take a risk on people.  Illegal immigration forces that risk upon us.  \n\nI'll take 1 million crying children at the border any day over 1 murder by an illegal."
'Their stories tell of unmeasurable pain and suffering.  Would Democrats want their children murdered by illegals? Should our vets have to wait for treatment live in squalor while these criminals are given everything for free? OPEN YOUR EYES. Please People MUST vote those corrupt selfish Democrats out of office! They are only interested in illegal votes and not the people. '
'I understand that you or a loved one can be killed just as easily by a citizen in any way, car accident, shooting, etc. But it is CRIMINAL and completely SENSELESS that any American Citizen should have their life snuffed out by a person who SHOULD NOT BE IN THIS COUNTRY in the first place. This goes doubly so for people who have felonies, DUI arrests, and Deportations! This is the most infuriating and senseless thing, that American Citizens die because politicians want to ignore laws to bring criminals into the country so they can exchange money and benefits for votes.\n\nNOT ANOTHER ONE!'
"It's heart wrenching to watch these forgotten victims of criminal illegal aliens reduced to begging and pleading for even one iota of justice. Congress and MSM make me sick.\n\nOut POTUS is fighting 24 hours a days for these weeping souls who have lost their loved ones to the waves of criminals that Congress has allowed to flood our great nation."
"I was gang stalked & hacked during the election as I've said many times before.  Stories like this make me tear up because I've seen the street level political intimidation by the left first hand that everyone wants to chalk up to conspiracy theory.  I was at a Del Taco one night near my house when this big Mexican guy jumped out of his white Mustang & ran at my car to intimidate me & send me a message.  I was just starting to receive death threats in other ways around this time.\n\n\nPeople need to wake up & realize that there are cops, unions & veterans that wipe their ass with our constitution.  It's time for some crucifixions..."
"angel moms and dads won't get any publicity until they demonstrate in front of Chuck schumer's home waving pictures of their murdered children, siblings, spouses, parents. "
"Liberals who endorse illegal immigration either through policy or complacency are the most despicable people on earth in my opinion because they are choosing one person's rights over another.  This mom and apparently 63,000 (since 2001) like her had their children stripped away from them forever but liberals don't give a shit.   That's more Americans dead at the hands of illegal immigrants than died in the Vietnam War and lefties said that was immoral... yet are okay with it now.  NOTE:  Since 2011 illegal immigrants have been arrested for over 25 THOUSAND MURDERS.. \n\n[https://www.gao.gov/new.items/d11187.pdf](https://www.gao.gov/new.items/d11187.pdf)"
"God that's horrible. Poor woman."
'People that hate trump and call him racist need to dee these videos. Trump isnt doing anything to be racist, he is doing every action for american citizens'
'Drumpf is using her and exploiting her miseREEEEE -stupid hateful liberals'
'Very sad story and totally feel for that mom though drunk driving is not isolated to illegal immigrants.  I suppose the biggest problem due to illegal status that she has no actual recourse over losing her son to this driver, no insurance and probably no civil suit but drunk drivers exist throughout the cultures in america.'
'Damn I have close family that don’t support trump, and I have unconditional love for them, but FUCK man how can you not support what this man is doing. Makes me frustrated sometimes that the fake news gets to smart people and they don’t see through it. '
'Ill never see this story on Facebook... heartbroken'
"Trump reinvigorated me aswell.  Not like I was going to kill myself or nothing, but I had resigned to cynicism.  After disastrous bush presidency followed by two terms of that grinning idiot Malik's lil bro, and watching conservative after conservative just give in to the media instantly,  then along came trump. \nBefore trump,  we were never even given a chance to fight.  Some conservative would say something,  media would demand an apology, and they'd cower and apologize before people could even express their support. Then the media would demand politician admonish their own base, and like a whipped dog,  they'd look into a camera and scold their own constituents.  for, in many cases, opinions no one even had, nor even had time to express had they even had them.       \n  I still remember the exact moment i knew trump wasnt fucking around.  It was glorious. "

'Beautiful. The Trumps have been spending the past year or two rebuking everything the media throws at them, and the media has thrown *a lot at them*. Those of the media have constantly discredited themselves by making wild claims with very very little to absolutely no basis in reality (see: MLK bust "removed" on Inauguration Day). They have become less and less based in reality and more and more attached to pure and utter hatred. The relationship between US and the media has been one of constant bombardment. They have doxxed some, and attacked others, always with constant vitriol. \n\nWe have proven time and time again that the media is irrelevant, and they have ironically helped us with that by their constant lying and disdain for us. They\'ve lost more credibility in the past year or so than during any other period in history. And now, Melania Trump is officially joining us in discarding them to the wind.

On top of that, 1/4 of his base would evaporate over night if he touches DACA.\n\nI mean, realistically, how many people around here would be okay with DACA even IF Trump got everything he wanted- the wall, no chain migration, no lottery, additional ICE, and e-verify?

"It's really too bad that DACA has to be leveraged for National Security (I.E Immigration Reform and a Wall).  I'm for DACA personally, but it doesn't make sense to implement it without change to chain migration first.\n\nProper border security is obvious and has been something republicans and democrats together have ran on for decades.  We have extreme amounts of crime and drug use enabled by poorly secured borders, yet somehow it's bad?  What?\n\nAlso can we stop calling them Dreamers?

'INB4 "These things take time. Be patient." \n\nIt\'s hard to reconcile that with the speed with which Mueller was appointed. I think that\'s the key frustration that many of the over-optimists don\'t understand. Why didn\'t the Dems have to be patient? With Republicans in power, no less. Then Sessions says we don\'t target our political opponents, all while this Mueller witch hunt is staring him in the face. No precedent for targeting an outgoing administration, huh? What about an incoming one?\n\nIt looks as if their goal is to bumrush through the Mueller thing on manufactured grounds and worry about the corruption loose ends and brazen double standards later, when anything about Obama and the Clintons can be stonewalled and made to fizzle into nothing. The GOP hasn\'t received anything close to enough heat over this. It should be priority #1 on this sub. \n\nAs for the Sessions hearing today, PM me your best nudes if this prediction turns out to be correct: It will be Sessions further reinforcing the frame of defense, defense, defense... with no signs of any legal counterattack whatsoever. My fap bin is empty and waiting. \n\n**Update:** So the DOJ apparently isn\'t in the business of revealing the existence of an investigation. I seem to remember some guy named Comey seeking permission from the DOJ to reveal the existence of a Russian-collusion investigation against the Trump administration, something he dropped during a highly anticipated Congressional opening statement. Funny how that works out. I guess an investigation *can* be revealed if it benefits Democrats for months in the media. Why do I get the feeling there\'s no investigation whatsoever and Sessions is simply hiding behind muh DOJ protocolz? '

Sounds like Rosenstein might need to resign now anyway since he is up to his neck in the Uranium One deal corruption. Enough with the stupid Twitter.

It doesn\'t question Sessions performance.\nYou can interpret it the way you want, but this does not constitute Trump stating his displeasure with Sessions performance.\nYou still haven\'t shown me proof.\nHaving followed Trump for more than thirty years. Reading his books and understanding his strategic thinking, I think this is being played the only way it can be.  I really have no opinion one way or the other on Sessions presently. If I\'m right, Trump is strategically manipulating events via Twitter and public statements in order to set the stage. This is all about timing and momentum and if they go too soon, they never get another chance. Making it "appear" perhaps that Sessions is a reluctant warrior in the fight against Clinton Inc. is more than likely part of Trumps overall strategy, but of course you know that.....right?\nWhat is gained by announcing your intentions.?What is gained telling your enemy what you have on them before you know you have a kill shot?\nIn the end, \nOne of us will be right on this, but if I\'m right.....we both win.

(This isn’t some new policy, it happens to Americans every day)\n2) don’t give your kids to a complete stranger on a fatally dangerous trek. \n\nEdit:\nAlso 2014-2015(Obama’s presidency)\nThere were laws saying that you must separate the children from the parents and they cannot be held in confinement, because it’s immoral. \nNow they are recanting those cries to the opposite. \nEven more proof of the hypocrisy of the left and that they are in fact just making fuss. Because, well, that’s all the Left seems to do. '

Pretty sure i came really close to being shot or shot at. That being said, i can not imagine the horror of hunkering down in a class room while a maniac goes from room to room shooting anyone. Ive had nightmares about it but sure its nothing compared to what students in columbine or florida felt. Its so surreal. When will this shit stop? I dont think its about guns either. If there were no guns there r still bombs and other scary weapons a psycho could use to complete his or her mission. I feel shit like this is only gonna get worse. Its happening too often, giving other maniacs ideas. Its like the next person tries to "one up" the previous pscho. How can this world seriously go on like this? I get a knot in my stomach thinking about it... like something catastrophic is gonna happen to our country or planet.

'The [**Behringer music equipment company**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behringer) started off as a German firm building semi-quality music gear with imported Chinese parts, and now makes its products in China.\n\n\n\n\n\\>Inside scoop: Uli Behringer had to move to China to directly supervise manufacturing, due to quality control issues leading to a large number of "Dead In The Box" products (brand-new items delivered not working.)  \n\n\n\n\nBehringer\'s business model is typical Chinese copycatting: lots of barely-disguised copies of high-dollar products, at drastically lower prices than the "real thing." In some cases, this involves direct bootlegging of intellectual property (and lawsuits with Mackie, Aphex, Roland, Peavey, BBE, dbx, Drawmer, etc etc.) There have also been safety concerns, as far as UL/CE safety testing. \n\n\n\n\nExample: Peavey\'s XXX-2 guitar amp was originally designed for Joe Satriani (at the time, it was called the JSX.) A very high-quality durable piece of gear, as one would assume- considering Satriani used this amp for touring. The Behringer knock-off is called a "333" and is as close a copy as they can manage for 1/3rd the price. But... it\'s also 1/3rd the quality and durability. The early models failed due to cost-cutting measures that looked good on paper, not so good when the high voltage was applied and things went dead, or caught fire. But this is a case of getting what you pay for, in terms of dealing with a company that uses its customers as beta testers/quality control inspectors.     \n\n\n\n\nSupposedly, their "quality" control is better now (I\'ll have to take their word for it, I\'ve seen enough DIB/gear failures from them that I 100% avoid their stuff.)\n\n\n\n\nObviously, the Chinese manufacturing "standards" have a lot to do with their low prices (plus the direct copying of other manufacturer\'s products saves time/money on research & development.) But I wonder if they are also taking advantage of this lopsided tariff scam to (unfairly) keep prices down. \n\n'

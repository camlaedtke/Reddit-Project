James Comey is a proven LEAKER & LIAR. Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was, in fact, fired. He leaked CLASSIFIED information, for which he should be prosecuted. He lied to Congress under OATH. He is a weak and.....
President Trump: "Little Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!"
So General Michael Flynn’s life can be totally destroyed while Shadey James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written). Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work? I don’t think so!
DOJ just issued the McCabe report - which is a total disaster. He LIED! LIED! LIED! McCabe was totally controlled by Comey - McCabe is Comey!! No collusion, all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes!
'remember:\n\n* immunity deals handed out like candy, 0 indictments \n* Critical equipment (the server) was not physically handled by FBI\n* Critical equipment was destroyed without approval from FBI (hammers)\n* Critical equipment went missing (laptop "lost in the mail")\n* 30k/60k emails deleted when they were under a subpoena order\n* Hillary was allowed multiple people in the room for her "interview" that wasnt even recorded\n* AG Lynch told Comey to call it a "matter" and he did\n* AG Lynch met with Clinton privately, immediately after she told everyone she would do whatever FBI recommended....conveniently the wording "Gross Negligence" was changed to "extreme carelessness" during that time.. so convenient, no?\n\n\nAfter his 10 min damning report of everything that was wrong with Hillary and the whole situation, **he could hardly believe he had said "no intent"**. Cover Up from the highest levels. '
"By who? The same people who know Combetta destroyed emails under subpoena, asked reddit for help in destroying them, who wrote to his friend during an investigation into Clinton that he was working on the Clinton cover-up, when the FBI knew he was lying, and had enough evidence to prosecute, instead gave him immunity so he could plead the 5th?\n\nSorry, my bad. It's being done by a guy calling it a matter, who found that bias lead to no bias, and can't prosecute.\n\n\\>\\*\\*“We received a referral on that from the FBI. We are handling that referral and we will issue a report when the matter is complete, consistent with the law and rules that are–a report that’s consistent and takes those into account,”\xa0Horowitz responded.\\*\\*"
'Seriously how the fuck do you admit to giving a professor without security clearance highly confidential information with the expectation of him leaking it and not go straight to fucking prison.  HOW. THE. FUCK. HE. ADMITTED. IT'
"Yeah. And in six months someone will issue a report that says he violated a bunch of laws, secrecy act, basically is guilty of treason. \n\nThey'll tell him not do it anymore. \n\nHe will write another book.\n\nSomeone come get me when the sleazy fuck is in fuckin jail."
"Get a lawyer you motherfucker. Comey is going to be someone's jail cell homie."
"Comey thinks investigating the leaking of classified information is frivolous. Hey asshole. Did you ever think that maybe THAT'S one of the reasons you were fired? As head of the FBI you didn't take your fucking job seriously? That protecting our nations data security isn't important enough to be investigated? Keep opening your stupid mouth jackass. The hole you are digging is only getting deeper. "
"Holy shit, there's a smoking gun.  Release the email.\n\nSMOKING GUN ALERT\n\nSMOKING GUN ALERT\n\nSMOKING GUN ALERT"
"They're just throwing us scraps to keep us occupied. Fuck it all until I see one motherfucker locked up."

"Im no lawyer but I have common sense. when some one is being questioned what person is lying both cant be telling the truth. the guy being question keeps saying i cant answer that basically pleading the 5th, Can't in some one hold them in contempt for not telling you anything over and over or at least some how arrest and or fine them? I mean if this happens to you and me we are in jail pretty much."
"Now we know the real reason why Comey covered for Clinton - he couldn't condemn her without endangering his own stupid ass for doing *the exact same thing*!"
'When the full IG report is released, sessions will have two choices.\n\n1. Prosecute that list of people\n\n2. Resign'

'Den of thieves and lowlifes?\n\nAlright he must lurk here. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/8bzy3t/when_you_see_something_spicy_on_the_donald_and/\n'
'INB4 "These things take time. Be patient." \n\nIt\'s hard to reconcile that with the speed with which Mueller was appointed. I think that\'s the key frustration that many of the over-optimists don\'t understand. Why didn\'t the Dems have to be patient? With Republicans in power, no less. Then Sessions says we don\'t target our political opponents, all while this Mueller witch hunt is staring him in the face. No precedent for targeting an outgoing administration, huh? What about an incoming one?\n\nIt looks as if their goal is to bumrush through the Mueller thing on manufactured grounds and worry about the corruption loose ends and brazen double standards later, when anything about Obama and the Clintons can be stonewalled and made to fizzle into nothing. The GOP hasn\'t received anything close to enough heat over this. It should be priority #1 on this sub. \n\nAs for the Sessions hearing today, PM me your best nudes if this prediction turns out to be correct: It will be Sessions further reinforcing the frame of defense, defense, defense... with no signs of any legal counterattack whatsoever. My fap bin is empty and waiting. \n\n**Update:** So the DOJ apparently isn\'t in the business of revealing the existence of an investigation. I seem to remember some guy named Comey seeking permission from the DOJ to reveal the existence of a Russian-collusion investigation against the Trump administration, something he dropped during a highly anticipated Congressional opening statement. Funny how that works out. I guess an investigation *can* be revealed if it benefits Democrats for months in the media. Why do I get the feeling there\'s no investigation whatsoever and Sessions is simply hiding behind muh DOJ protocolz? '
"I'm so sick of seeing all this clear cut evidence of corruption and nothing ever comes of it! It's time for all those corrupt assholes to be perp walked on their way to PRISON! DO YOUR FUCKING JOB SESSIONS!!"
'Honestly I’m tired of this shit. He’s the president. Just order Sessions to do his job and if he doesn’t just fire him. Trump can’t be a passive commentator on this. '
"He's getting sick of Sessions doing fuck all and who can blame him?\n\nI doubt Sessions will last through the end of the year."
'History is bound to repeat itself if these corruption are not addressed. One of the reason why the Roman empire fell is due to government corruption and political instability:\n\n> The political rot also extended to the Roman Senate, which failed to temper the excesses of the emperors due to its own widespread corruption and incompetence. As the situation worsened, civic pride waned and many Roman citizens lost trust in their leadership.'
"Just fire sessions, wtf can mueller do now? He can't even open his mouth now that he's part of the scheme, he was the one who delivered the uranium! "
'Just reading through some of the responses...\n\nhow can people be so "involved", and yet so intellectually dishonest?  They are clearly the kind of people who follow the President and respond to his daily tweets, and yet they actually believe all the propaganda and lies.\n\nIt\'s frankly depressing to see such stupidity and ignorance in our fellow Americans.  I need to avoid these people and just stick with my fellow pedes.'
'Trump you need to dump the useless baggage. Remove and replace Jeff Sessions and replace him with somebody that has a set of balls.'
"I've been defending Sessions up until now but I'm done. He needs to be replaced NOW! No more will we tolerate injustice.  "
"I think coming into this Trump and Sessions were at a disadvantage because it would have looked like a political vendetta against these people but by holding out and letting proof of corruption leak out by other means in combination with tweets like this, I think Trump is trying to drum up enough public outcry that when Sessions does something he'll be doing it on the will of the people."
'It is so irritating seeing the clown comments pushed to the top, seeing those sad liberals all over his tweets'
'Why does he have go on Twitter and ask “Where is the Justice Dept” He is the damn President. Why doesn’t he summon the heads of the Justice Dept to his office and tell them to either deal with this or be fired. Sounds like Rosenstein might need to resign now anyway since he is up to his neck in the Uranium One deal corruption. Enough with the stupid Twitter. I think people would prefer if he did weekly web cast or Facebook live if he wants to speak directly to the people. Twitter is a shit show.'
'Must not be easy trying to be the President with both sides constantly trying to sabotage you constantly.'
'Those direct twitter links are cancer.  I have to see some retarded never trumper replying to trump\'s tweet 4 times as if Trump is going to personally reply to him.  \n  \n  "They closed the clinton investigation!" lol'
'You concern trolls can all fuck off. Guess what morons, if Sessions or any other AG is moving like he should be, you will not be hearing about it. Not even a scintilla will be telegraphed. Learn how high-level criminal investigations work.'
'Every fucking time Trump Tweets, that IR.net account is at the top.  Followed by 16 tweets by that faggot that runs IR.net.  It even says so in his Twitter bio lmao.  Can this retarded shit be any more transparent?  So sick of the cuckery and manipulation on social media. It has to stop.'

"I'm sorry but listening to Sessions talk is painful.  He already pussed out once, I'm not confident for round two."
'Made me log onto twitter to see what I thought you would send me.  You owe me!\nThe Tweet simply asks a question. It doesn\'t state a fact. It doesn\'t question Sessions performance.\nYou can interpret it the way you want, but this does not constitute Trump stating his displeasure with Sessions performance.\nYou still haven\'t shown me proof.\nHaving followed Trump for more than thirty years. Reading his books and understanding his strategic thinking, I think this is being played the only way it can be.  I really have no opinion one way or the other on Sessions presently. If I\'m right, Trump is strategically manipulating events via Twitter and public statements in order to set the stage. This is all about timing and momentum and if they go too soon, they never get another chance. Making it "appear" perhaps that Sessions is a reluctant warrior in the fight against Clinton Inc. is more than likely part of Trumps overall strategy, but of course you know that.....right?\nWhat is gained by announcing your intentions.?What is gained telling your enemy what you have on them before you know you have a kill shot?\nIn the end, \nOne of us will be right on this, but if I\'m right.....we both win.  If your right....we all lose.'

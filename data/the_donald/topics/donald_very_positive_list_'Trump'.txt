CNN’S slogan is CNN, THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS. Everyone knows this is not true, that this could, in fact, be a fraud on the American Public. There are many outlets that are far more trusted than Fake News CNN. Their slogan should be CNN, THE LEAST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS!
Love card from the Trumpster himself!
DONALD J. TRUMP: Wow, watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked “have you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?” He said strongly “never, no.” He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends.
GEOTUS: "Thank you to Rasmussen for the honest polling. Just hit 50%, which is higher than Cheatin’ Obama at the same time in his Administration."
@realDonaldTrump: Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!
A year ago the pundits & talking heads, people that couldn’t do the job before, were begging for conciliation and peace - “please meet, don’t go to war.” Now that we meet and have a great relationship with Kim Jong Un, the same haters shout out, “you shouldn’t meet, do not meet!”

@realDonaldTrump: Wow, looks like James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton long before the investigation was over...and so much more. A rigged system!
The FBI was Wiretapping Manaford between 2014 and 2016, but dropped the investigation because they found nothing. then they reopened it again a few months later, when he joined the Trump Campaign. Did not stop until after Trump had won!

Watching him speak, start-to-finish is *so* much different than the spin the media puts on his soundbytes.  I voted Johnson this time but I am really warming up to Trump.  The more the media screeches and blow things out of proportion, the more people like me are inclined to smell the BS and go find the truth from the source.  So far, president Trump has had me agreeing with him and i see how bad the media just stays on their own points obsessively to get their smear-story'

I know that most of us here have/take the time to watch the speeches ourselves, but it can be a humorous and informative red pill for those who don't have time, or those who just want a bullet-point summary."
"Personally I think we should GTFO and pursue other ways to prevent potential terrorism in the U.S. (eg: strong vetting, deportations, stronger border security including a wall). Being President Trump didn't say anything about a relatively near GTFO plan, I'll be optimistic there is one. "

"Obama: I require that we go to the fancy, expensive, exclusive sushi place that they featured in that documentary!\n\nTrump: Hey, I'll eat whatever you like. $10 burger? Sounds great! Delicious! \n\nGREATEST PRESIDENT!"
'>The burger that Trump dined on was the “Colby Jack Cheese Burger“, which costs a mere 1,200 yen (US$10.54). At this price, which is significantly less than a night out at Sukiyabashi Jiro where Obama dined during his Japan tour, anyone can afford to try a presidential meal, and that’s exactly what everybody did yesterday, when it was reported that the Toranomon outlet had completely sold out of burgers by 2:30 p.m.\n\nSo from the Obama article, we learn:\n\n>President Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe just finished a meal at Tokyo’s Sukiyabashi Jiro, one of the best sushi restaurants in the world.\n\n>Sukiyabashi Jiro is headed up by 89-year-old master chef Jiro Ono. In addition to his restaurant’s three-star Michelin rating, Jiro is widely regarded as the world’s top sushi chef and was featured in the 2011 documentary “Jiro Dreams of Sushi.”\n\n>His 20-course sushi meal is expensive — 30,000 Japanese yen (just under $300) — and lasts just 15 to 20 minutes as courses are served in rapid succession.\n\n>Obama and Abe’s dinner at the 10-seat restaurant, which is located in a subway station, lasted a leisurely hour and a half.\n\n>“That’s some good sushi right there,” Obama told reporters as he left the restaurant.\n\n###The Kenyan took over the most famous 10-seat restaurant in Japan for an hour and a half where turnover is very 30 minutes normally at $300 per person, that’s about $9000, vs Trump and his $10 burger. Trump earned every dollar of his billions, Obama’s luxury was at our expense. '

"I love the Japanese, their culture and food. Everything about them is amazing. I can't wait to vacation there eventually."
'I love the message Trump sends by eating "commoner American food" with world leaders. It\'s the same type of "one of us" mentality when I see him eating in mess halls with our military. \n\nTrump is American through and through, and more in touch with the common American than most rich elite. '
"Japan is so crazy that this doesn't surprise me at all, lol.  Incidentally, when I was in country, we ate at a local burger chain called Mas Burger in Sasebo that was out of this world.

I think they should have made it where people who live in high property tax areas didn't see an increase (not sure if that was possible), but if they could have done it the GOP could have claimed a tax cut for every American...now there's this asterisk. Anyway, overall, it's def a step in the right direction for the American worker, imho.\n\nAlso, (as a pure hypothetical.. not claiming these are projections) if I'm offered 2x the buying power for my work, on the condition that my employer will receive 10x the buying power from his investment, I'm taking that deal every time. Who cares if my boss is benefiting more than me? I'm still better off than I was yesterday, that's all I really care about. I think some people wouldn't push a button that would eliminate poverty if it simultaneously doubled the 1%'s wealth."

'Not only that he helped countless amount of people BEFORE he became a politician (which honestly he really isn’t a politician) but still. He used his wealth to actually help people along the way. Did he benefit from it? Of course. But at the end of the day Trump is improving people’s lives. He isn’t just “talking” about improving their lives meanwhile behind the scenes trying to further his alternative selfish agenda. This is what makes me sick about the Clintons and people’s love for them. For god sakes people from Arkansas their own home state fucking hate them, that should tell you everything you need to know. Along with Obama, what the fuck did he do for Chicago? Meanwhile Trump did countless things for New York before he became president, he actually made an impact in his community without it even being his responsibility. '

"Watch the mental gymnastics on this one:\n\n*Well, you see it isn't unheard of for the US economy to grow like that, unexepectedly. And one really has to wonder if it has anything to do with Trump at all. I mean, his policies weren't even in effect while these gains were being made. In fact, if we trace the economic growth back from 2014 - clearly when Obama was in office- to today, we see a steady trend upward. That has to lead one to believe that all of these gains were due to Obama era policies hitting their stride. What I'm saying is, we haven't seen Trump's policies affect the economy yet. I predict that when we do, the economy will take a nose dive.*\n\nHow do you explain the rather robust growth in the stock market since Trump took office?\n\n*Well, again you have to just follow the data.

"Wow a liberal woman thinks virtue signaling is her job.  I'm shocked."
'I love how whenever a natural disaster or big event happens everyone looks to the US or blames the US in some way, if the US just focused on helping our own country maybe we wouldnt be trillions in debt. I can understand helping PR though as we might as well just make them the 51st State.'
'I love donald Trump '
'While most PR officials are reading from the same page of something like "the people of Puerto Rico are tough and united, we will get through this together. we thank the federal government for lending us assistance as we recover from this disaster", she went the opposite direction with "the people of Puerto Rico are helpless and dying, why isn\'t the federal government doing more to save us.". That is fairly embarrassing.\n\nspez: in general, in a time of crisis, it\'s better to have tough, reassuring leadership than someone bemoaning their predicament while wearing a t-shirt that literally says "we are dying".'
"This couldn't have worked out any better. What fucking monsters trying to play politics with people's lives."
'She may not do her job, but we can do ours. Pray for Puerto Rico, pray for our leaders, and give money to responsible charities if you can.'
"How can she or her supporters expect to have their desire for PR statehood taken seriously if they aren't even willing to work with federal entities during a crisis?\n\n#PULL YOUR WEIGHT OR DON'T BECOME A STATE!"

'Everyday that goes by, as a Canadian, I’m jealous and envious for the first time in my life, of the country below mine. I wish I could have someone who so deeply cares about the country he’s governing. \n\nEvery damn day that goes by, I am blessed to be living in this timeline. I am blessed, the man I used to watch on the apprentice, who had no fear, spoke his mind, “You’re Fired!”. I used to wonder, why he was never spoken about constantly, even though he was an icon and one of the best real estate developers in New York in the 1980s, you never heard anything about him. \n\nHe has gone bankrupt, he’s been at the top of the food chain with an estimated worth of $3.1 billion. His speeches at the rallys I’d watch online, were so powerful that it moved me. We’re all sinners, and nobody is clean. He feels so much like he’s actually putting the people of America first. I am very happy to hear this pardon news. Sorry this may seem long, I’ve just never expressed my feelings towards trump in anyway as most of my town is liberal. God bless my neighbouring country, America, god bless Donald J. Trump for helping start the revolution, and god bless you all.'

'Best President'
'Great news! Saucier was my MM1 for a few months at NSA Saratoga. He was a great guy who made a mistake. Glad to see he can get his life back on track now.'
"I had the pleasure of working with MM1 while he was going through this whole ordeal. Yeah he fucked up. He did his time. I've never known him to be anything less than an honourable person in a bad situation. I'm glad his example serves as contrast to how we have a two tiered justice system when it comes to liberal democrats. \n\nOne standard for all! This is the first step. Thank you President Trump once again for your strong leadership."
"Now if only he would pardon Snowden, he'd pretty much secure his position as the best president ever. "
"That is very nice to hear. The guy had no intention of doing wrong - just wanted some photos to remember the boat by. Believe me I get it that the stuff is sensitive, but come on. ~~It's not like he went back into engineering and took pictures.~~ Alright turns out he did do that. He really should have known better. Like he *really* should have. Still, time served, and even the reactor itself is only confidential. Good to clear his record."

This country owes them a debt of gratitude. I hope history shines kindly on them."

'I’d appreciate if UPS could address the toxic management culture that breeds burnt out employees, burnt out management, and dissatisfied customers. The aggressive nature of management has caused workplace violence in Alabama, California, and just yesterday Kansas City. \n\nWhen is UPS going to solve it’s real problems (not enough routes and allowing virtual OJS and Orion to dictate stops per car, under staffing sorts and giving management a free pass on workplace violence, stealing bargaining unit work, and deriding part time employees) and stop with the PR push? If the company operated in an ethical manner, all the PR would be free, and good at that. \n\nPlease treat us like human beings, and stop referring to us as “bodies”. Please allow center managers the freedom to put the routes in so that service can be made, and we can see our families at night. Please just have an ounce of ethics and treat your workers with a little bit of dignity and respect.'
'I heard Rush Limbaugh today talking about a liberal reporter saying "Theses bonuses are nothing, why not make it an extra $1,000 a month instead of a one-time thing?". Then Rush made a good point about how under Obama bonuses were never discussed or even thought to be possible. It was all about getting used to having stagnation and no growth, we\'ve hit our limit, America can\'t do any better and we don\'t deserve to do any better.'

"My dad retired 2 years ago from UPS after close to 40 years, and he's always been a bleeding heart and watches a lot of the MSM.  He's been worried about his pension since retiring, as there's no insurance that his payout will stay at a livable level.  I very much enjoyed sharing this one with him.  His pension atm is excellent, but for those unaware there's different pension plans for UPS based on what region of the US you worked/lived in. His pension was still covered by UPS which makes this investment great news, 5 billion towards the pensions, but other regions were owned & operated by 3rd parties that had cut pension payouts to as low as 30%."

"UPS has had their Smart Logistics Network expansion planned since at least the end of 2016. They are/were working with Amazon to expand ecommerce services.

I can't even imagine how fast this train will be moving in the next 3 years. 95 percent of my friends are libs and I can't wait to rub it in their face about how stupid they were acting / thinking. "
"Big business is very wise. I'm inside free enterprise!"
"I used to believe the president simply doesn't have any effect on the economy. Trump is proving that theory wrong with countless strong examples like this. Also, who knew my vote would be rewarded with $200 extra in my paycheck every month? It's stunning how much he's gotten done in such a short time, no one could have thought this was possible. "
'Oh you mean you have someone who knows how to create wealth in trading jungle that is New York and not just a community organizer?'
"They had no clue to the economy, so they were easy marks to crony capitalists who tricked them into giving them money. Crony capitalism isn't different from communism on the economy front: the state makes the business decisions and they are shit.\n\nTrump on the other hand is a self-made billionaire who has more knowledge about the economy in his finger than all the economy professors combined. For example he didn't let Ryan and McConell just cut the taxes of businesses and investors, he made sure that employees got lot of cuts too. Hint: investors just sit on their savings, employees consume, so they run GDP. Had Rubio been president, he could be convinced to give nothing to the average Americans."
'As my father put it years ago "This country doesn\'t need an ex-lawyer or a campaign manager as President, we need a business man." \n\nSince day one I knew Trump was going to be a success. A man who\'s already worked with most big foreign governments, who\'s already made deals with them, already knows how to succeed, keep costs down and profits up. We\'re a big business, we needed a big businessman to helm the wheel. '

'>Goodell: adding that "while the league respects the right of its players to express their opinions"\n\n**TOP KEK** They fined Marshawn Lynch thousands for not saying enough, they fine players for the most arbitrary (speech/opinion related) things.

'I love having trump as president...I feel like my voice matters finally. '

'"If we have to go higher (on the wealthy) we\'ll go higher"\n\nBut but but. CNN said The President loves tax cuts for the wealthy? '

'Middle class serves only as a buffer between the lower classes and the upper classes. Ensure the system stays in place by gaining a strong support of the "middle class". Its worked since the Revolution and wont stop any time soon. '
"The rich have *never, ever* cared about personal income tax. They only care about their business and the completely insane corporate tax. The fact society thinks rich people actually care about their own taxes is hilarious. People are not that much of money grubbers, especially when they already have a fucking ton. In fact, most rich people I've talked politics with are in favor of increased taxes on the mega wealthy to keep up with reduced taxes for the middle/lower class."
"Look up Bernie's precious Denmark's corporate tax rate if you want a good laugh :)  It's 22% which is right in the ballpark of what Trump is trying to negotiate for the US "
"Wow, the end of the video was pleasantly surprising. I'm glad they didn't go full cognitive dissonance."
'I’m just happy that at the end they admitted that there’s an inherent bias against President Trump without even hearing or understanding the facts. I’m also pleasantly surprised that, even after hearing that the Plan was the President’s and not Comrade Sanders’s that they still liked the plan and didn’t make excuses for liking it in the first place. Maybe there’s hope for these people.'
'What do you think they said after the camera was off? \n\nLmao this was excellent in quality. Perfect setup.'
"When Trump says this tax plan should be a no brainer for both sides it's actually true. I'll probably end up paying more taxes since I will be in the highest bracket and live in California. Might eventually encourage me to move my primary residence but I am a sucker for the beach life. So to say this new tax plan is a handout to the rich is just plain wrong. I do think it's a more fair tax plan though and I support simplifying the process. The only people that benefit from a complicate tax code is the rich and it makes it hard to figure out what you can and can't afford."
"Many don't realize this but Bernie can still win. "
"What is most amazing of this video is everyone's response after realizing it's really Trump's plan. Surprisingly accepting.\n\nThis seems to be a good tactic.\n\nWhat if I told you Donald Trump and Melania colluded heavily with Russia. Melania received $500,000 after coordinating an effort to give the Russians 20% of our supplies to make nuclear missiles which they then exported from the USA to who knows where (Iran, NKorea) with Trump's charity (has an extremely bad reputation) received 145 million dollars beforehand? Oh, and to top it off, the whole Trump family was aware.\n\nFeel free to copy pasta. I'm using on FB to redpill the proles."
'Oh man their videos are great. This one is great as well. \nhttps://youtu.be/C7x7UPsttTY\nThe kids bash Trump and lecture on how the ideas are wrong for them and wrong for the country and then go silent when they find out it was actually what Obama did in his first 100 days. Ha!'
'HA - they agreed to inheritance (death) tax and business tax cuts - amazing. '
"On the positive side, I love the honesty these kids offer once they're called on the bias."
"Credit where it's due, they were capable of introspection when they heard the plot twist"
'I love these "JK that\'s actually Trump you just said you loved not Bernie" experiments as much as the next guy but doing it this way leaves enough of a mental gymnastics escape to keep the cognitive dissonance going. They could always rationalize it away like "oh well just cuz he says that doesn\'t mean he\'s doing it/going to do it because he\'s Trump and therefore a liar and will just find some way to hurt women/monorities/gays/whatever in the process, duh." or something like that.\n\nWhat I want to see is the inverse of this idea. Ask their opinion on a Sanders/HRC policy but tell them it\'s Trump\'s. Let them argue against their own "side" and tell you why they think it\'s bad. Then drop the bomb. It\'s pretty hard to keep the cognitive dissonance going when you just laid out exactly why "your own" (read: the propaganda\'s) position is retarded.'

"Reminder: This only happened because Trump won by a landslide. Trump clearly won New Hampshire, likely Nevada, and maybe others. They (the Democrats, the Clinton campaign, the Establishment) cheated. They cheated a lot. And Trump still won. He won so bigly that they just couldn't cover it up. \n\nIf it had been closer, if Trump had won critical states by a smaller/normal margin, the cheating would have worked and...  Hillary Clinton would be President of the United States of America. \n\nWe must fix the election system. We need Voter ID. We need it now. "
"I especially like the parts where everyone who said they would go to canada if trump won did not do that, instead they cried on camera for a little bit, then resumed normal operations.\n\nBecause no, it's not the end of the world for gays, or whatever made up gender you have.

'Nobel or not - he gets my prize for being The Best President EVER!'
'Accept it only under the condition they rename it to the Trump Peace Prize.'
"They should rescind Obama's and Yasser Arafat's first. Then, this award would truly have some value."
'If they give it to him he should decline. Insist that "peace is the prize" as he already stated. '
"I really hope he wins it so he can tell them that they can keep their fake award, he doesn't want it!!! 🤣"
'The Nobel prize means nothing... EXCEPT THE SWEET TASTE OF LIBERAL TEARS THAT FLOW!!!'
'Might be slightly premature, and the Nobel committee surely wouldn’t give the prize to a US President prematurely!'
'I honestly cant recall the last time someone deserved it. Trump definitely does though.'
'CNN - The Russians hacked the Nobel peace prize! '
'I hope The President accepts Nobel peace prize and donate the money to build the wall'
'If he wins the Dems will sue the Nobel Peace Prize.'
'Alfred Nobel is the man the Nobel Peace Prize is named after. He is also credited with the invention of dynamite. Go figure that out. '
"Meh, they've given the peace prize to literal war criminals before (like Hillary's good buddy Henry Kissinger) so at this point I don't give a fuck whether or not they acknowledge Trump's success with the Korea negotiations. He's done something incredible, whether or not some Swedish shitheads decide to give him a meaningless award."
'Obama’s prize devalues Nobel Peace now. Not worth anything anymore. '
"Fuck the Nobel Peace Prize. I'm tired of hearing about it.  That award doesn't mean shit.  We should create a new  more prestigious award for Dr. President Trump.  The man has end a century long war and decreased chances of humanity eradicating it self with nuclear weapons.  "
'And the worst part about this for the left and their MSM minions is *they all know Trump is an absolutely legit contender*. Even if they’ll never admit it.\n\nIt’s this continual resistance and denial of vivid reality that is slowly winnowing thinking normies away from their echochamber.\n\nThis is such an amazing time to be alive. An historic period that will dominate historical media for decades to come.\n\nI’m continually reminded of a Newt Gingrich interview prior to the election. Newt was asked, “Do you really think Trump can win?” He responded, “Not only can he win, but he could be the greatest president in our modern history.”\n\nThe interviewer laughed. Newt smiled politely. Prescient.'
'I hope he attends the awards ceremony and then rejects the prize because it was devalued by them giving it to O for doing nothing.'
"As much as I love the idea of Trump winning the prize, and hate liberals lying about Trumps involvement in the talks, I do believe it's a bit premature to celebrate. Rocketdad and Rocketgrandpa have pulled stuff like this before Rocketmans reign. Let's wait a few months and see if prisoners are released, inspections of nuclear disarmament are allowed."
"when he wins, he needs to refuse the award unless they take Mr. Soweto's away first."
"Would love to see a non-leftist win the prize, but I'm a little conflicted.  This would put Trump in the company of Obama and Arafat.  This is hardly a prize worth winning any more.  "
'Calling it now: Trump will respectfully decline and recommend KJU and MJ get it.\n\nIt\'ll make obama look like an asshole for accepting his. It\'ll blow MSM and liberal minds that he turned down something "he would just brag about for a month." Being humble after great accomplishment will make Trump look better than any award. KJU and MJ have to appear as equals throughout all of this and accepting it as a pair helps project that.'
'F the Nobel peace prize. It means nothing anymore. I think President Trump should reject it and stick to "peace is the prize".'
"Yale took back Cosby's award. Nobel should retract Obama's before it would mean anything for Trump. Besides, Trump's reward will be great in heaven. He's not wanting or needing a Nobel Peace prize. He's a lot more humble than he's being given credit for, that's for sure 😊"
'Nobel is trash. FREE THE SLAVES '
'I support it I just would like us to actually get peace first.'
'I think him winning it will help his image with people who may be on the fence about voting for him again or for the first time in the 2020 election '
"While I'm glad that the Republicans at least are able to comprehend The Don's role in this, I'm not sure how I'd feel about him getting that prize. On one hand, I agree wholeheartedly that he's deserving of recognition. On the other, I kinda feel that the whole Nobel Peace Prize is a joke at this point and doesn't really mean anything."
"Current members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee (In other words, the people who decide who gets the Nobel Peace prize):\n\nBerit Reiss-Andersen: former politician for the Norwegian Labour Party, in other words: leftist. Will never vote for Trump.\n\nHenrik Syse: he is anti-Trump. Google translate this article written by him if you don't believe me: http://www.verdidebatt.no/innlegg/11642138-bloff-makeren-donald-trump\n\nThorbjørn Jagland: politician from the Norwegian Labour Party. Leftist, will never vote for Trump.\n\nAnne Enger: might vote for Trump.\n\nAsle Toje: might vote for Trump.\n\nOlav Njølstad: don't know, need more information about him."
"He absolutely deserves it, but they'll never give it to him. He could bring world peace and cure all diseases they still wouldn't give it to him."
"The Nobel Peace Prize don't mean shit when it's been politicized. "
"I think we should hold off on this until NK actually signs something. Right now it's just talk and the last thing we want is for Trump to get the prize then for nothing to come of it; this would effectively make it just like Obama's prize."
'All this nobel peace prizr talk is just trump getting us to think past the deal. The peace deal. '
'I hope he accepts the prize and gives a shout out to the anons and autists during his speech '
"I don't want to SAY that it's happening, but god does it feel like it. \n\n**spez**\n\nOk I'll say it. It'shappening.webm\n\n**spez 2**\n\nMuller indictments are official. I'm calling happening. "
"He knows who is going down and why and it is YUGE. Trust me, CNN is scrambling and they don't have leaks!\nTrump will make it easy for us"
"Looks like things are coming to a head. We're in the end game Peres, this is where things get interesting. "
'Bystander weigh in - He knows what happened to jfk trying to correct the direction of the country. He has first hand experience that some could get into his space since the Russian flag throwing incident.  He knows he might go down.  He figures the American public deserves to know what’s going on behind the scenes even if it costs him his life.  This guy, I love him more everyday for what he is willing to sacrifice.  He will no doubt go down as the greatest president “of the people, by the people, and for the people” that this country has ever known. What a hero. \n'
"My heart is fluttering with excitement and absolute love for our President, you guys. I didn't think I could end up loving him as much as I do now, but every day he proves to me and to all of us that he is the golden man that will save us all from the macabre evil that has been drowning our country. He is our messiah, our savior, and I pray for his safety and his family and loyal administration's safety every single day. "
"I've said it since the day he said he wasn't going to go after Hillary because she's been through so much: he was definitely going after her and was just Trumping the fuck out his quad aces. It's just like when he talks about how great someone is before he fires them. Trump is the type of guy who gets nicer the more he is going to eat your lunch. "
'I think this was he was referring to with the "calm before the storm" statement. \nI bet these will clearly show the bribes they took, the wiretaps and unmasking they did and  also they colluded with both Russia the British spy. '
'I really hope the happening we’ve been waiting for is happening. I got this text from the official Trump text alert thing:\n\n“FROM: Trump Headquarters\nSubject: RUSSIA?\n\nAfter a year of lies, Crooked Hillary and the DNC have been EXPOSED, paying a company to use a foreign agent to take down President Trump.\n\n...And the company they used has ties to RUSSIA.\n\nWe need the IMMEDIATE support of the American people.\n\nDEMAND answers from Crooked Hillary and the DNC.\n\nTake action. Expose their cover-up. Contribute and Fight.”\n\nSounds like something may finally be happening, I hope. '
'LMAO CNN DID IT AGAIN! CNN Hires Mind readers! \n\nPresident Donald Trump has made it clear to the State Department that he wants to accelerate the release of any remaining Hillary Clinton emails in its possession as soon as possible, **according to three sources familiar with the President’s thinking**.\n\n\n'
'I hope to same thing happens to the justice department. An example needs to be set that no one is above the law, not even swamp creatures.'

'As an engineer, this is really exciting.  Our infrastructure has been deteriorating for decades.  We haven’t really built new infrastructure since the 70s.  This will be interesting because most of the engineers I know have been more targeted towards maintenance of existing infrastructure rather than new projects.  It will be interesting moving forward.

The real debate should be about which policies work and which don’t.\n\n>I spent three years reporting on the $840 billion stimulus plan that the Obama administration pushed through Congress in 2009. My conclusion: government can create jobs — it just doesn’t often do it well.'
'Investing in ourselves should always come first. It\'s like when I see people helping out overseas in other countries, great, good on you, but what about right next door? "we built a library in East Bumfark" .. great, what about "insert the top 10 crime-addled cities in America here" \n"We\'re building homes for the homeless of (other country here)" .. and yet We have a homeless population problem in Seattle, why not help there?

"Outnumbered is showing their meeting for the time being live.  It's funny watching some of these people who opposed PDJT during the campaign like New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez bend the knee and thank him for including them in the meeting and announce the new jobs coming to their states.\n\nPDJT had to be tough on people during campaign because he knew that he had to win in order to get our country back on track- economically and exposing and rooting out the corruption.  Once he won, he wants to be partners with them.  Gov. Walker has found that out."
'Call me a Russian spy, but I’m very sceptical about the whole infrastructure thing. How do you ensure the money won’t just go down the tubes like it has every time we’ve heard this promise for as long as I’ve been alive? We can’t even get cities to obey immigration law. '
'They can\'t help how stupid they are, it was her turn. spez: They say the wheel of justice turns slowly, yet the government prosecutes at lightening speed if they can win and win big. When they can\'t win easily or on a strong legal base they bleed their opponent, as seen time and again in recent decades. The past admin used partisan intelligence, gathered by a foreign spy who paid 3rd party "Russian intelligence sources", to spy on a political opponent during a heated presidential race. \n\nNothing of the original cause proved any allegation of wrong doing or criminality, yet during the supposed peaceful transfer of power many partisans used the ambiguity of this situation to slow, illegitimatize, and hopefully remove a legally elected president for ulterior motives. Our past admins, Bush/Clinton/Bush/Obama, and their partisan pals weaponized the oppressive spying ability of ours and allies to target their enemy. \n\nOur Republic has been forever stained by their willful destruction of our civil liberties to further personal and political aims. Shameful and historic, their role will be forever known.'
'We\'re not only in the second year. It will be officially two years in just a couple of months. This operation started in the summer of 2016 and Hillary, Obama and others were already making "Russia interference" in the election public and were already associating GEOTUS with them. "He\'s too nice to Putin!", they said. I remember thinking how full of shit they were and I wasn\'t even on the train yet. They hit him so hard on everything else, it was pretty clear they were just going to make stuff up to get her elected. Never believed it even for a second. THEY OVER PLAYED THEIR HAND!'

'I want to high-five this beautiful man so badly!'
'This will get buried, but I was talking with my friend who made an interesting point: Trump keeps calling it a “witch hunt.” But who is really the witch? Hilary right? What if Mueller is actually the good guy and the shit with Hilary is actually gonna follow through at the end of this? I’m very skeptical of it all but I could still see the potential of that crazy fucking twist. And with the mention of Democrats in this most recent post seems to point (somewhat) in that direction. '

'now, dont get all angry with me, Im not a Q or /hesourguy wingnut, but lets be frank - IF I was just elected president and I KNEW the only way to get any of my agenda passed or even survive the inevitable impeachment attempts was to GAIN seats in the mid term elections....\n\nAND the overwhelming historical reality is that the incumbent loses huge seats in those 1st term mid terms....and the REASON for those losses is generally the complacency of the base that elected the POTUS....\n\nThen I would promote and push, maybe even orchestrate, some kind of ongoing process to FIRE up my base and undecideds day after day - it would be my only hope - and I would have that procedure become more outrageous and out of control every day leading right up to the mid terms.\n\nDoes this sound familiar?\n\nOne final note: **can anyone tell me the last time in modern history a  President GAINED seats for his party in the midterms, and why?**\n\n*ANSWER: Bill Clinton, who GAINED seats in his  midterm* **precisely because the general public and especially his base was infuriated with the off the rails overreaching SPECIAL PROSECUTOR INVESTIGATION of Ken Starr**....\n\nSo GEOTUS COULD have planned this all along, or he could just be the luckiest guy on the planet to have exactly the one and only circumstance where he could succeed and survive politically be the developing reality in front of our eyes..\n\nHere endeth the lesson.'

"I find his posture very interesting.  I'm sure bombard will be all over this."
"Had this weird dream that Trump had no choice but to launch the nuclear missiles, and it actually saved the U.S. because he made the tough choice.\n\nHowever congress then tried to impeach him for it. \n\nThis ended up causing a civil war between his supporters and opposition, with the supporters coming out victorious with the help of all the military and police defectors, and purging the government of those who'd been in the way and us publicly executing them all and following Trump as the leader.\n\nIt was definitely a weird dream.

'Trump changed things, he took every punch from the media head on. I have never seen anything like it in my life.\n\nAfter everything is said and done (he will win a second term, count on it) I think the history books will treat him much better than the media of today which will not be the same in a few years anyway.'
'I would LOVE to see the same study for Obama for each of his years.\n'
"Weird, almost like it doesn't seem the press has a vested interested in informing the public accurately and objectively. "
'90%?!? Wow I didn’t realize  it improved so much!'
'Here’s what I know about trump just from being 28 and learning about him from the apprentice.\n\nThe guy is a brilliant motivator.  He has a very warm professional demeanor, and works hard to get his staff doing what they need to do without browbeating, insulting, or sneaking scheistering.\n\nHe is also very good and unsettling opposing forces, whether they’re businesses, political opponents, or foreign powers.  He plays mind games well, using calculated condescension to break the will of his opponents.\n\nPersonally, I don’t know him.  He seems to have a loving family, his exes don’t seem to have much bad to say about him.  And he seems very well regarded by personal friends.\n\nOverall, a guy with his reputation in business is a lot like Don Vito Corleone, a brilliant, powerful, and loyal friend...but an extremely powerful, unpredictable, but magnanimous opponent.  You cross him, he will outmaneuver you.  But if you come to him hat in hand, he is gracious in victory.\n\nOverall, he’s a man we need in our corner, and I think most of America sees it.'
"So many people just rely on what the news says. If the mainstream media wasn't so damn biased, his approval rating would be 80\\+ &#37;."

'What would his approval be if we had an honest media? I don’t mean a right leaning media, just news that was reported with integrity? It would be over 70% I believe.'

"I remember the green protests back in 2009.\n\nMy understanding is that the US chose to have a muted response in order to avoid discrediting the demonstrations. The concern was that vocal support would play into the hands of the Iranian authorities, who sought to portray the unrest as a product of foreign meddling and protesters as American pawns.\n\nIts good to see those people haven't been broken by their theocratic police state."
'I\'m thinking we should look deeper than just "the left."  A good question right now is "who benefits??" \n\nWhy would the leftist media be against a revolution in Iran.

Democracy is about as real as Professional Wrestling. Democracy is nothing more than a theater through which those who hold real power use to legitimize their own Tyranny to the people.\n\nWhat we're really learning is that we will not be allowed to have any say over our own lives or our own existences. Our lives and destinies have already been decided for us by those who are not us. We exist as nothing more than peasant serfs, plugged into the Matrix we call Democracy. We buy into the lie that we have freedom, because the reality of how oppressed we truly are is that horrifying to us.\n\nIf there was a time in which we could all live as free individuals and decide our own destinies, how great it would be. Our lives for us and by us. \n\nBut for all of us right now, we must understand truly, our lives are not even truly our own at this time in our existence as a species."

I signed up because I was actually using a payphone to make calls at the time and didn\'t think much of it. 400 minutes every month and no cost, amazing! /s I noticed a few people who weren\'t at the job center to look for jobs get 3 phones in 1 week. The entire, literally the entire program was complete and absolute fraud. Shady ass phone companies like "Blue Jay Wireless" had skimmed tens of millions by signing people up multiple times and inflating costs. These companies got kickbacks for every person they signed up. Welfare needs complete reform and that\'s coming from someone who has been on it. From 16-27 I worked and paid taxes & into SS. Had it not been for social services when I was pulling myself out of the shit, I\'m not sure I\'d have made it. The one biggest thing that could be done to save us hundreds of millions of dollars is put a federal work requirement on SNAP. Families in the US can get a maximum of around $750 per month on a debit type card that works for any type of food - even candy. There is literally nothing stopping anyone from dropping all $750 on snickers bars for example. The majority of families on SNAP have able bodied adults that are not disabled yet not working and not trying to work. When states have instituted the work requirement, their case load drops off by YUUUUGEEE numbers. I think that welfare is a good program that if reformed would help those that have families and have lost their jobs. But the loopholes need closed and programs like the Obamaphone should never take off the ground. We would have done better taking money out of our pocket and lighting it on fire. '

I think energy is a much different story than normal trade. And you have a country like Poland that won\'t accept the gas. You look at some of the countries that won\'t accept it, because they don\'t want to be captive to Russia." \n\n"Germany, as far as I\'m concerned, is captive to Russia because they get so much of their energy from Russia.

'The best parts of this should be edited down into three separate 60-second television commercials for the re-Election campaign. \n\nHere’s how they would go:\n\n\n**COMMERCIAL ONE**\n\nVoiceover: “I’m Donald J. Trump and I approved this message. \n\n*Cut to Red Breakfast footage from 3:57 - 4:57*\n\nTrump: “Germany is just paying a little bit over 1%, whereas the United States in actual numbers is paying 4.2%...of a much larger GDP. So, I think that’s inappropriate also. We’re protecting Germany, we’re protecting France, we’re protecting everybody, yet we’re paying a lot of money to protect. \n\nNow, this has been going on for decades. This has been brought up by other presidents, but other presidents never did anything about it, because I don’t think they understood it, or they just didn’t want to get involved. \n\nBut I have to bring it up.\n\nBecause I think it’s very unfair to our country, it’s very unfair to our taxpayer, and I think these countries have to step it up. And not over a 10-year period, they have to step it up immediately.\n\nGermany is a rich country, and they talk about increasing it a tiny bit by 2030. Well, they could increase it *immediately* tomorrow and have no problem. I don’t think it’s fair to the United States, so we’re gonna have to do something because we’re not gonna put up with it. We can’t put up with it. And, it’s inappropriate.”\n\n*Cut to: Trump/Pence 2020 closing slate, featuring “Keep America Great” slogan*\n\nEND\n\n\n(By the way, that full unedited chunk above is exactly 60 seconds long. It’s almost like Trump instinctively knows how to condense and package soundbytes for media, lol)\n\n\n\n**COMMERCIAL TWO**\n\nVoiceover: “I’m Donald J. Trump and I approved this message. \n\n*Cut to Red Breakfast footage from 4:58 - 5:58*\n\nTrump: “We have to talk about the billions and billions of dollars that’s being paid to the country that we’re supposed to be protecting you against. You know, everybody’s talking about it all over the world. They’ll say, ‘Wait a minute, we’re supposed to be protecting you from Russia, then why are you paying billions of dollars to Russia for energy? Why are countries in NATO, namely Germany, having a large percentage of their energy needs taken care of by Russia?\n\nNow if you look at it, Germany is a captive of Russia, because they supply it. Germany got rid of their coal plants, got rid of their nuclear. They’re getting so much of their oil and gas from Russia.\n\nI think it’s something that NATO has to look at. I think it’s very inappropriate. You and I agreed that it’s inappropriate. I don’t know what you can do about it now, but it certainly doesn’t seem to make sense that they pay billions of dollars to Russia and now we have to defend them against Russia.”\n\n*Cut to: Trump/Pence 2020 closing slate, featuring “Keep America Great” slogan*\n\nEND\n\n\n(By the way, that full unedited chunk above is ALSO exactly 60 seconds long.

I think two world wars and the Cold War taught us that we are stronger together than apart...”\n\nTrump: “But how can you be together when a country is getting its energy from the person you want protection against or the group you want protection against?”\n\nBureaucrat: “Because we understand that when we stand together also in dealing with Russia, we are stronger.  I think what we have seen is...\n\nTrump: “No, you’re just making Russia richer. You’re not ‘dealing’ with Russia, you’re making Russia richer.”\n\n*Cut to Red Breakfast footage from 7:13 - 7:35*\n\nTrump: “You take a look at some of the countries, they won’t accept it because they don’t want to be captive to Russia. But Germany, as far as I’m concerned, is captive to Russia because it’s getting so much of its energy from Russia. \n\nSo we’re supposed to protect Germany, but they’re getting their energy from Russia.

'President Trump pounds home the fact that energy is a strategic asset and cannot be viewed in the same context as all other global trade.  He is most certainly correct.  Without energy independence and an ability to maintain energy resources in the face of a conflict, a nation is beholden to their energy master and the armies will quickly be sitting ducks, starved of energy resources, in the event of war.'
'I am here to say one thing. Lot\'s of truly great things happened today. Our President know\'s how to trump all of everything else in defense of our Nation. Pun Intended. It\'s the man\'s name. I FOR ONE, and eternally thankful, daily, on my knees, that "President" is combined with "Trump."  Thank you, President...THANK YOU. We aren\'t out of breathe, either. LET THEM HAVE IT! God Bless Carry On. Wait I can\'t say that to POTUS...crap...(Salutes and runs out) =) Wow is Correct.'
"I'm just burping my newborn pede at 2:40 in the morning with a HUGE shit eating grin because I am so excited for my children's future! The brass balls of President Trump are Making America Great Again for future generations!!!"
'Holy shit this is the best thing I have ever seen!  I love this man!  Planet sized balls in the middle of the globalist lions den.  CNN will be reporting that Germany getting all of their energy from Russia is good thing...now back Jim Acucksta for more Russian collusion bullshit.'
'This is honestly one of the greatest things I’ve seen an American President do in my life. I remember when Gerhard Schroeder was leaving his Chancellor’s office in the early 2000’s. There were rumblings in the press about how he had secured secret deals with Russia to start building these pipelines, against he wishes of people in his own government. Viola! He leaves office then becomes a top dog at the Russian company building the very same pipeline, taking in millions for himself over the last 15 years. \n\nTrump is literally exposing every single hypocritical European policy for the charade it is. I’m so glad to have a President that isn’t politely following the policy game plan these globalists have neatly constructed over the last 30 years.  '
'Masterful. Omg wow. Lol '
"As an Irish man, living in Ireland, I'd like to say that he's also working for people like me, around the world, who believe in the MAGA dream. My country owes a lot to America, I've lived there for a year (legally), and believe that a strong America is good for everyone.\n\nI also hope he sparks a fire among our own politicians, to put the people first. Not the EU, not the WTO, not the IMF, but the people who actually make up the country.\n\nHis work extends beyond America, and its great to see him push back on Germany, and get the EU to start working for its people, not its ruling elite."

'#Lock. Them. Up.\nIt\'s been clear for a while that they weren\'t prepared for the upset Trump victory, and so have had to scramble to cover up what appears to have been pervasive spying on political opponents. The evidence will trickle out and they will continue to harp on "muh Russia!!1!" which is a convenient excuse/scape goat thanks to the Wikileaks releases during the election. Somebody is going to jail when this is all over, and it\'s looking more and more like it will be a senior Obama official.'
'So Trump was wiretapped and they obviously found no evidence of corruption.\n\n\nA scandal free President. Good to know! Thanks Obama. '
'Will all the media cover it though?\n\nI have a feeling Obama could come moonwalking out during an award show, say he illegally wiretapped President Trump, and moonwalk away, and hte media would talk about his dance moves and not the message. \n'
'This is why their strong arming Manafort so hard.. they NEED him to confess to something to justify the Trump unmasking to protect deep state. '
"Hell, Yeah, Mr President!\n\nDid I mention how much we adore your audacity to say things directly?\n\n'Cause we do.\n"
"As a Swede. Good relations between the U.S and Russia are welcome. We're in the middle"
'Kinda wish he would tweet out:\n\n"How ya doin James Gunn?"\n\nI know it has nothing to do with him, but I would love the libtard reaction.'
'Its crystal clear now that the deep state runs the country and the media is part of it. The liberals are really good at one thing and thats branding. They know pop culture influences the masses and theyre using it like seasoned professionals to move half the us population.  What else can explain this insane witchhunt they have going on trump?\n\nThe liberals literally select which facts they want the hear and leave out the ones that are useless to their agenda.  You can start with the fact that the russian investigation shouldnt even have happened.  Obama leaves office but makes it easier to get a fisa warrant and the fbi puts it to good use.  Even after that, theres a 1.5 year investigation, theres tons of evidence that comes out, but none that lead to trump.  After finding nothing, they dont stop, but keep looking for literally anything. That is a witchhunt. Lets throw in the mass media reporting nothing but fake stories on these fake accusations, which is not only on russia, but previous relationships and business dealings.  They make history by killing the lawyer, client privilege and raid Cohens office to find what exactly?  Anything.  Witchhunt.  \n\nThis president has literally accomplished more in his first year then obama did in 8.  Hes make the world safer with n. Korea and russia, yet nothing but scandals.  Every fucking demographic is doing better economically and still hes a racist.  This my friends is a witchhunt.  \n\nI literally cannot talk to liberals anymore because i feel like they are either stupid, or just prejudiced.  If you look at nothing but facts and leave out the crap on cnn, or msnbc, you cannot think trump isnt doing a great job.  Its just not possible.\n\nI really hope that the people who voted for trump go out in 2020 to vote for this hero again.  We cannot let these leaches win another elcetion ever again.  The future of america cannot be socialism.  Well end up like europe and bow down to anyone who yells at us.'

It is part of what made them liberal from the 60s through the early 2000s. Forty years of opposition to the man.\n\nToday, liberals worship at the feet of big government, and the CIA cannot tell a lie. It\'s unbelievable. They take as gospel the very words coming from the MSM that they used to abhor. This should be something that is studied by political scientists and psychologists and media effects experts. It\'s the propagandists wet dream come true, but it\'s actually kind of scary that a group this large can collectively have principles of their core ideal changed like this by a psychological operation.'

But after being on the forefront, he now see's exactly the kind of garbage Trump is up against, and that's exactly why Kelly has been soo defensive of Trump.  The lefts actions against Trump, converted Kelly into a Trump supporter.  \n\nSure Trump didn't know him, and what can you really say in a call like that?  It's not a call to make things better, it's a call to show respect, that someone as important as the president takes the time out of their day to do it.    \n\nEveryone with any wits knows that a presidents job has a lot of downtime.  You might for example have a lot of meetings, make a lot of decisions, travel a lot.....but in between there's down time of 10, 20, 30+ minutes where there's really nothing to do.  So to make a call like this for a president is not hard, time wise....which says a lot about other presidents like Obama who never made calls like these.  \n\nTrump has proven time and again that he's not trying to be the holier than though copacetic focus group molded president that only does what a room full of people think looks the most presidential, which often has more to do with vein attempt at prestige than actually being a human being.  \n\nPeople like Obama put themselves on an altar, and people like Trump come down from the altar.  Trump would likely be out in the middle of the streets shaking hands daily if it wasn't for all of the insane liberal nutjobs that would love to hit or kill him.  "

'My logic... it was proven the the DNC and it\'s super delegates conspired against Bernie .. correct?  or was it the Russians? .. ( smirk)... so it only takes an idiot with mild intelligence to realize that if anybody meddled with the US elections it was the same people start to finish and it wasn\'t the Russians.  When I phone banked for Bernie after the "data breach" which the DNC had the helm of the data company, why is it that at least 90% of the numbers I called said the same thing.. that person doesn\'t live here anymore ?  or you have the wrong number... I"m telling you 4 hours and 90%... a little odd.. did the Russians do it?  I don\'t really think so.  If DT could only love the environment and  have compassion for ALL American\'s he might get Love beyond his ability to imagine it.   I didn\'t vote for him.. I voted for Jill Stein like 50% or more of the Bernie supporters.. but then she only got 2% of the vote or less according to the reported "data"...BS... she had 20% Easily... so was that the Russians too... screwing Jill..

'>Fox News is told that the version Trump plans to declassify contains “technical edits” made at the request of the FBI.\n\n>Sources said the edited version was shown to five FBI officials at the White House on Tuesday afternoon. Sources said the officials were satisfied that the edited memo addressed concerns they had about the earlier version they reviewed on Monday.\n\n>Yet, in a rare and surprising rebuke, an FBI statement was released on Wednesday asserting they had “grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy.”\n\n>A source familiar with the memo said the edits included some addressing grammar and clarity, as well as an edit done at the request of the FBI and another at the request of committee Democrats. The source challenged Schiff’s claims, saying the edits were made before the memo went to the White House.\xa0\n\nWTF is this. The FBI and Democrats made edits on Monday before it went to the White House on Tuesday?'
"I'm starting to wonder if this is all about building a house of Strawmen.\n\nThese FBI officials were working on behalf of someone. \n\nThis OIG report (remember the memo is just a summery of this report) seems to only expose the soldiers of this sedition . \n\nI sure hope the ringleaders are exposed as well or these tactics will surely become our new political reality.\n\nRegardless of  a person's opinion about Trump, this was/is an attack on the Office of the US President, duly elected in a free and fair election. \nIt cannot happen again"

'>The narrative that the North Korean leader is "crazy" and "unhinged" is propaganda. He is pretty intelligent (like his father he went to good schools in Europe) and his antagonism against the US is generally in direct response to antagonism from the US.\n\n>The DPRK has even pursued Nuclear non-proliferation but the US refuses to acknowledge this and has further poisoned the well by overthrowing governments, like Libya, who have agreed to the west on nuclear non-proliferation. Then there is Iran, which has shown the DPRK and the world in general, that the US is truly not interested in playing fair. We will violate our own terms at our discretion. Therefore, the DPRK has no reason to capitulate but rather sees it in their best interest to "prove" their resolve whenever challenged on the matter. We continue to challenge them on the matter and thus, our current situation.\n\nLiterally a quote from redacted.'

"There is more to this than just the FDA getting in the way.  The drugs aren't free...  Some, such as monoclonal antibodies are incredibly expensive just to make and are made by tiny companies that cannot afford to give them away.  So it falls to insurance companies to approve payment for a drug that has yet to be proven to have efficacy.\n\nWhat this will fall back on is how much this will push insurance to approve the payments for such drugs.  There will be definite positives, such as allowing people with life threatening antibiotic resistant infections such as MRSA access to lysin therapy (Contrafect's CF-301 which is in a phase 2 that MAY be pivotal but its a high bar from phase 2 to direct approval) while they are still in early development...  But for other drugs like OMS-721 (which might be a miracle drug for kidney compromised patients with high proteinuria, Stem Cell transplant related TMA and possibly a litany of other applications) which will be 100K+ for a year... It will fall on insurance companies to approve it.  Same with the ULTRA expensive, labor intensive cutting edge immuno-oncology treatments that will cost 300-500K or gene therapies that might cost a million bucks."

For example, I’m sure you’re acquainted with Ben Rhodes, who was Obama’s deputy national security advisor but who actually spent most of his time as a skilled political operative, constructing Obama’s “narrative.” Until very recently, I was literally Ben’s personal attorney, so of course I learned a lot from him about writing fiction, which will be useful to our legal team as we create our own narrative for what Trump did. (For example, it’s easy to leak to the media that evidence is piling up by the day, even when no evidence whatsoever has been found.) In fact, when the House Intelligence Committee was investigating possible Russian interference, I was literally Ben’s liaison with them. So I know what I’m doing –- literally –- and am, above all, political. Ben’s letter of recommendation is attached. I have also attached letters from my respected colleagues at the FBI, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page (who say hi), and also from Andrew Weissmann. They know I have what it takes to get the job done!\n\nI hope to join your investigative team as soon as possible and get to work unseating Donald Trump.\n\nThank you for your consideration,\n\nJeannie Rhee'

I have no idea who they ask in those polls, but they are sampled oddly I am sure.  \n\nIn general, I want a MAGA candidate to support POTUS.  I have that with Stewart.  Virginiapedes, I know it was a tough primary, but we all need to unify and kick out Kaine.

'The Great Bird Feeder Analogy\n\n\nI bought a bird feeder. I hung it on my back porch and filled it with birdseed. What a beauty of a bird feeder it was, as I filled it lovingly with seed. Within a week we had hundreds of birds taking advantage of the continuous flow of free and easily accessible food.\n\nBut then the birds started building nests in the boards of the patio, above the table, and next to the barbecue. Then came the poop! It was everywhere, on the patio tile, the chairs, the table…everywhere!\n\nThen some of the birds turned mean. They would dive bomb me and try to peck me even though I had fed them out of my own pocket. The other birds were boisterous and loud. They sat on the feeder and squawked and screamed at all hours of the day and night and demanded that I fill it when it got low on food.\n\nAfter a while, I couldn’t even sit on my own back porch anymore. So I took down the bird feeder and in three days the birds were gone. I cleaned up their mess and took down the many nests they had built all over the patio.\n\nSoon, the back yard was like it used to be…quiet, serene and no one demanding their rights to a free meal.\n\nNow let’s see…..\n\nOur government gives out free food, subsidized housing, free medical care, and free education and allows anyone born here to be an automatic citizen.\n\nThen the illegals came by the tens and hundreds of thousands, millions. Suddenly our taxes went up to pay for free services; apartments are housing 5 families; you have to wait 6 hours to be seen by an emergency room doctor; your child’s 2nd grade class is behind other schools because half the class doesn’t speak English. Corn Flakes now come in a bilingual box; I have to ‘press one’ to hear my bank talk to me in English, and people waving flags other than ‘Old Glory’ are squawking and screaming in the streets, demanding more rights and free liberties. When asked why they breed like cockroaches, the reply is that it is a cultural thing.\n\nMaybe its time for the government to take down the bird feeder.'

'Dems love McCabe, so is he telling the truth or a dirty, lying rat willing to throw his former friends and colleagues under the bus? Dems caught in a nice catch-22 there. '
'Wait, I don’t get it, the whole argument seems off.  In McCabe’s statement, he specifies that he talked with the media “through my public affairs officer and a legal counselor.”  So he didn’t do it anonymously, and it doesn’t seem like he even tried to. It should be on some sort of record somewhere?  \n\nThis is important because Grassley asked Comey specifically about ANONYMOUS leaks. So aren’t McCabe’s and Comey’s statements unrelated? It seems like Comey could have answered Grassley truthfully even if he knew McCabe talked with the media, simply because Grassley specified “anonymous,” and McCabe went through the legal non-anonymous channels.  Or am I missing something?'
'How good is his security detail?  That takes some balls.   Wow!   I still am rather unclear as to how deep and organized the Deep State actually is.  Are they really all that organized or is it just individuals in isolated positions limited in what they can actually bring about.   '

Yet when it comes to the USA, immigrants abuse the generous loopholes in the law, bring their pregnant wives to America and have their kids here to give them citizenship. It's a scummy practice of cheating the law. America is a loving and generous country-- where man, woman and child can come and trailblaze their own path and reach the American dream .

"Meanwhile in NC Duke Energy is trying to raise prices for customers to cover coal ash storage after their disastrous episode a few years ago when their Dan River Steam Station dumped coal ash into the Dan River in Eden, N.C.  They only got a $6 million dollar fine for that.\n\nhttp://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/business/article197462949.html\n\nThe handling of that was a large part of why we got a Dem governor on the last election (although I do suspect some vote tampering from the East coast counties).\n\nDuke needs to absorb all of these costs and not pass them onto the customer.  I don't have a problem with coal energy at all.  But when there is an accident, the price falls on them, not us.  I live on Lake Norman. There is a steam plant on the north end of Lake Norman.  Residents near the water just a few miles from me are still getting pallets of bottled water from Duke.  Everytime I drove down 150 I see dozens of people fishing right at the waters edge near the coal plant.  Fishing to eat them, not sport (we have hundreds of sport fishing tournaments. The lake is stocked intentionally).  You can also see mountains of coal piled up.  But the building is unsightly and seems to have not been updated since the 60s.\n\nConversely we have a nuclear plant on the south end.  I am a huge proponent of nuclear energy and hope that we can get POTUS to reduce regulations so America can build more nuclear plants.  Ours exhausts into the lake so no tacky towers like I used to see when I grew up in Pittsburgh.  It's actually a very neat looking building.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGuire_Nuclear_Station\n\nOn a side note, I also got a notice that Aqua NC (community well water provider) has won their case and are increasing fees starting this month.\n\nI don't know where I was really going with all that except to say I am glad others are seeing utility benefits when NC customers are seeing increases.

Don't start assuming that just because money was saved due to the tax cut that all of that saved money will come right back to the people. Walmart offered shitty bonuses to a few people and is now laying off tons more workers.

'BEST FUCKING TIMELINE'
"Hahahahahaha fantastic!!! \n\nPast...Do you hear that? That's the sound of liberal heads exploding."
'The idea was never to indict trump. He can\'t. Only Congress can remove a president. \n\nThe idea was to use Mueller and the selective leaks to the media was to 1. Distract trump and force him to focus on this instead of his agenda. And 2. To bring down his approval numbers and set up impeachment should the "blue wave" happen. \n\nNeither of those things have panned out and Mueller is on the ropes to produce something. Anything. \n\nIf they can\'t bring Trump\'s approval down, they\'ll never be able to impeach him. If they can\'t Distract trump from his agenda, Trump succeeds. '

'> cannot indict a sitting president is laid out in a 1999 Justice Department memo\n\nyeah we don\'t need no stinking memo. He won\'t indict because he cannot. Firing Comey is a basic power of the presidency, enshrined in the constitution.  It requires no reason and no explanation. The idea that somehow obstruction of justice charges could be brought over that is looney tunes, yet a hundred "experts" spent the past year saying exactly that on TV every night.  Same goes for every other obstruction of justice fantasy they have, like a press release or tweets or talking about pardons or saying "Flynn is a good guy". shit like that would be laughed out of court for anyone, let alone a sitting president'

"Peace is achieved through mutual understanding and respect. Such a thing can only come through conversing with each other. This was a bold move by our president. Being able to negotiate peace without having to bend the knee is the mark of a strong leader. \n\nA lot of European leaders likes to grovel, beg and conduct all sorts of sycophantic behavior to appease their overlords.

'Kim Jong Un has allowed horrible things to happen in NK.  But this was the environment in which he was raised and it was normalized for him.  He obviously has an interest in changing and becoming a "hero" to his people by opening up to the world.  He also recognized that this would be good for him personally as he can travel more openly, maybe get to see Hollywood or an NBA game or whatever his interests are.  So our choice is to not allow him to change by holding the past against him.  In which case he will continue to try to get attention by being a nuclear threat and endangering millions of people including the US.  Or help him evolve and eliminate the threat, improve conditions for the people of NK, and make the world a safer place.  The choice is easy.  But the left is having to hedge on his past as a reason to not work with him.'

"No offense taken-- we're essentially a Trump campaign rally (as stated by the rules), but outsiders are always welcome to the rally. We just don't allow protesters inside, etc. \n\nTo your point, I am a bit baffled by Trump's opposition literally throwing independents at him. They're giving him the midterm by looking like absolute lunatics. The only explanation I can think of is that politics hasn't fully adjusted to the age of social media yet. "

I think the iran situation clearly shows us who in American politics is for and against the survival of our country... It's the litmus test for all politicians. Anyone who supports arming and funding iran under it's current regime, most doesn't support the US or our citizens... Take that to the bank... "

'Do great things, get nationally recognized.  I love it.  We elected a man who fights back!'
"I'm listening to him on Rush's show.  What a true patriot and a great guy.  One of the most telling things he said is that he can't even talk to the mainstream media because they are all so left that they aren't even slightly receptive to what he is saying.  He said it is impossible to talk to them (in my words because they are spoiled liberal snowflakes that drank the koolaid). "

I have longed to see that in a President since I came to Washington."\n\n'

"I think this much is clear. No matter the meddling. And it needs to be addressed. That shouldn't get in the way of any beneficial deals that can be made with Russia and Vladimir Putin. The left. And the Democrats just wish to completely shut Russia out, at least on the face of it, cutting off their noses to spite their face. \n\nTrump, on the other hand, a businessman, knows the utility of dealmaking despite outside issues. The Democrats and the liberal press are not only corrupt but they're idealists that view the world as black and white. A businessman sees (potential) opportunities in the grey. "

"Let us pretend Obama was just foolish and not doing something illegal like working with the russians, but letting them hack freely means they could easily put in a tracer to remotely hack it later. So either way, it is Obama's fault. But I really want a interview where he explains his reasons, he needs to be subpeona'd otherwise."
"Give them hell boss .....they thought Hillary was going to win and had it in the bag .I'm glad I waited 2 hour under the rain to cast my vote for Trump after voting for Obama 2 times.

Corker and Flake want to go out swinging, Trump will swing back AS HE SHOULD.\n\nWhen he calls out "liddel Bob Corker" on Twitter, he\'s speaking what\'s on my mind. And your mind.

You have to stand proudly for the national anthem or you shouldn’t be playing, you shouldn’t be there.

DS might have taken him\nout by now but for an extremely well armed public who will be very\nangry if they do.\n\nMany of these minutemen, especially those who have trained and organized, are ideologically akin to confederate soldiers who, god bless them, could give two craps what some a-hole in washington deems "wise" or "patriotic" or "heroic" but who know damned well when their god-given rights are being trampled and choose not to be a hapless victim.\n\nThat flag with all 50 stars and the pledge of the 50 states\'\nindivisibility is a thinly veiled reminder that the federal government reserves the right to do to any seceding state(s) the same thing lincoln did to the confederacy -- where half a million died, for what? I still don\'t know.\n\nI shy away from abstractions, ideologies, and symbols because they are abstractions, ideologies, and symbols. I don\'t need them or feel any vacancy from not having them.

'I\'m a pretty big fan of Charles Barkley and the way he talks about the black community.  Yesterday he said it\'s time for democrats to finally start helping the black community instead of just putting up a facade.  Do we know if Doug Jones would support some conservative ideals or will he be full on anti-trump.  Because honestly he better get with some of the agenda otherwise he is out in 2020. \n\nFurthermore Charles who I don\'t think ever blames America\'s problems on "whitey" actively campaigned against Moore because of his racist and evangelical past.  I doubt he would have pushed so hard if Jones or Brooks was nominated.'
"The major take away for Us online should be this, and this is what president Trump is telling us:\n\nStop overthinking president Trump's tweets when he endorses someone to us!\n\nWe all know president Trump uses tweets as strategic distraction or for strategic value. But when President Trump is addressing us directly, and by us I mean the American people, if we don't take his words at face value and instead convince us that it's some sort of 4D quasi Jiu-Jitsu chess on steroids, we undo the work Trump is trying to accomplish for us on our behalf.\n\n even if Trump appears to be supporting an establishment candidate, we need to listen to him and Trust his judgment as perhaps even if establishment, Trump knows a way to get this candidate on board with MAGA values.\n\nGoing forward, we need to trust Trump. If Bannon and Trump conflict over a candidate, we need to side with Trump. Alabama is what happens when we side with Bannon over Trump and try to convince ourselves that it's some sort of grand 4D plan - we take it in the ass.\n\n"
'If you want to make a difference: Find out about the races for the House and the Senate that are coming up in your district and state next year:\n\nhttps://ballotpedia.org/Elections\n\nFind out who the candidates are, and pick the one that has the best combination of MAGA & likelihood of winning, and contact their campaign! Get involved!!! '
'Strange or Mo Brooks would have won without question at this point.\n\nThe fact Dems could paint the opponent as an actual pedo made him an easy target and mobilized the most "virtuous" to go out and vote against Moore.'
"This is exactly right. The GOP needs to run candidates who support the America First agenda and they will win. The party needs to be singing from the rooftops the progress made on the economy and jobs, border security, the war against ISIS' caliphate in the middle east, and tax reform. Judge Moore was a terrible candidate and this needs to serve as a lesson. "
'OK people. From now on, can we just listen to Trump when he starts supporting candidates? His instincts seem to be better than other people. '
"President Trump is the leader of our revolution, not Bannon. We elected President  Trump to lead us, we should listen to him, not Bannon.  \n  \nOne man has risked his life, fortune, and sacred honor to try to make this country great again, the other is a fucking journalist. Get your minds right pede's. President Trump is our Commander in Chief."
"> increase the razor thin margins in both the House and Senate.\n\nThis is the key. I want the GOPe gone as much as the next 'Pede, but perhaps for 2018 we should focus on just making sure the Republicans win the seats. We can drain the swamp later."
"I respect that Moore stood his ground regarding the accusations, and I had hoped he would win just to keep the R seat. I can't support Dems on anything beyond the local level because the national party views. I hope Jones does right by the citizens of Alabama because that is the job first and foremost above any party agenda. That said I am not hurt by the loss of Moore, because I didn't vote for Trump based on religion, abortion,or social issues in general, it was a vote for jobs, economy, and putting America first."
'If the RNC could start being an opposition party too, that would be great. '
'I would add that it was a crystal clear example of the establishment playbook in the 2018 and 2020 congressional races - GOP incumbents that are primaried by MAGA opponents will simply see the GOPe/RNC sabotage the race and throw the seat to D\'s.\n\nNow we know. We suspected before, but now its clear, they just did it.\n\nSo when POTUS says we need "strong" MAGA candidates, I agree, but they need to be more than GREAT, because Moore was pretty strong IMO. They need to be INCREDIBLY GREAT, on a Trump level - which will be difficult, because they will need to overcome the uniparty.'
'It proved that the head of the snake is alive and well. The numbers were a mathematical impossibility. If u have nothing 2 hide why destroy voting records?'
"Why couldn't he say that before the election and pressure his party to find a better candidate?!?!?!?!?"
"I voted Moore yesterday but I wasn't excited, felt like a chore but did it because I knew he would push the Trump agenda. Most of the other people I knew didn't vote or couldn't vote for Moore. I guess I'm not surprised by the results.\n\nI just hope Alabama runs a better candidate and someone the people can be proud to vote for next time. It's unfortunate to hear that Mo Brooks announced this morning he has prostate cancer.\n\nThis election has actually motivated me to get more involved in my community and see what I can do. Hopefully, we can avoid an election like this next time. "
'["They don\'t know how to win -- I will teach them!"](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/785854588654092290?lang=en)'
'The frank take on the matter is Moore was a bad candidate. I am not going to say what should have been done because it is easy pretend to be smart while having the benefit of knowing the outcome. Going forward we need Cruze-ites, hardcore conservatives who can smash through legislation that actually helps the American people (mostly by getting out of our way). Smash obamacare and replace it with the free market. Decrease the power of the courts (and in the meantime keep filling them with conservatives. Ban the murder of unborn babies and keep our military strong. Moore deserved to lose, even if it would have been good for the agenda and great for keeping the majority. Ideally I would have liked to see him win and immediately be replaced but I am much more disappointed that we lost a seat than he did not win. MAGA /  Uhuru.  '
"Moore was a great candidate. He loves God and his country. He is great for religious freedom. He knows a woman's proper place. And he's dedicated to keeping degenerates from getting special treatment under the law.\n\nIf Soros hadn't hired a bunch of women to lie about Moore, he would have won in a landslide.

Repeatedly they'd tell me it's not how it was when they were kids or when their dad's were members, there used to be a lot of closeted Klan members in State congresses but not many in US Congress.

They all "love and respect women" and they\'re the most duplicitous, useless, two-faced little bitches I have met. \n\nOur guy though, wow. He just comes right out and speaks his mind! It\'s wonderful. You know exactly where you stand with Trump and you know exactly what he wants and expects. None of this stupid passive-aggressive \'um, well, I *think* that was insensitive though um I mean...\'  or disapproving finger-wagging of \'Well, THAT was transphobic because you just oppressed...\'\n\nWhat a breath of fresh air.\n\nThis is a man who does not need to assure people that even though he\'s committed the lefty sin of being a white hetero man, he\'s ACKSHUALY a good guy etc etc. He understands that real men do not hide and dart around surreptitiously. He\'s not a fucking secretive voyeur like Obama who spied on everybody but pretended to be a Good Guy. \n\nTrump is not afraid to show who he is. I love that about him. He\'s an old school guy who takes the heat and doesn\'t wilt like Obama did and then play the martyr for sympathy and the tears of his supporters. \n\nWhen Trump gets attacked, he doesn\'t whine and pout like a spoiled teenage girl and then tell all his BFFs to call him "classy" on social media. He calls out his enemies entirely on his own. \n\nI wish there were more men like him. I\'ve never seen a guy take more shit than this President and remain unbowed and proud and strong. \n\nObama and his wife had a fucking picnic compared to what Trump has endured. Trump has taken way more shit in 2 years than Obama has ever had to take in his entire entitled, elitist life.\n\nTrump is a man.

'I’m sorry! 😅  But, could someone, please,  explain-to-me-like-I’m-five?  What does the president mean by this tweet?  Thank you!'
'The bots on twitter are short circuiting on this one. Greatest Present in my life time and a bonus everyday of all the snowflakes / bots pushing those talking points. It seems like the Soros money is slowing down. It use to be alot more but not so much. But you always have the top 12 regular bots responding. Its really an easy script bot that is being used/program. I remember programming mIRC scripts/bots/bot nets back in the 90s. '

"All things considered, I trust an independant citizen with less at risk than a news organization, and more specifically, I trust anyone more than I trust CNN.\n\nSo I'm pretty comfortable just saying that CNN is lying on this one.

'networks cant control us anymore. thank god for the interwebz \n\nand 93 is a lower number. more like 99%'
"I am hopeful that the left never catches on that they are instrumental in Trump's rising poll numbers!\n\nWhy I myself only voted for him to keep Hiliary out of the White House.  Donald Trump was about 12th on my list of GOP candidates, and I did NOT vote for him in the primaries.\n\nBut man oh man am I impressed with that man!  His performance has been nothing short of spectacular!  And the added fun of liberals trying to take him down and constantly lambasting his supporters strengthen my resolve!\n\nThere was a time when I voted mostly all Dem.  But then I grew up and started paying attention.  That's all it took....paying attention."
"Just realized how much nicer it could all be if the treasonous media wasn't constantly smearing our President.  How much happier we could all be, that our prosperity is returning, wages are growing, and progress is being made in many significant ways.  If they weren't being such shitheads, so many more people could feel the joy we feel at the words and news coming from Washington.\n\nAlas, it seems there is much more swamp to drain before anything of the sort happens.

'For a while I have had this sneaking feeling that 2018 would be a Republican landslide on the scale of 1994.  \n\nRepublicans running this fall need to realize that they get on the Trump Train or get run over.  Any R that does not endorse Trump is effectively saying "Vote Democrat."  Why would voters who don\'t support the President vote Republican?   They won\'t.  Republican office seekers who want to win ONLY move is to enthusiastically endorse the President.'
"This is nothing but spun propaganda. Trumps latest numbers are at 49% according to the Rasmussen poll.  WHICH is actually slightly down from his previous marks of 60, 59 ans 56 % . Just saying.  Don't understand why no one can get the facts right on either side of the fence, Seems like the entire country is delusional lately.  But that's got nothing to do with an incompetent leader whose been on vacation 103 days of his first year on the job, after stating he'd have no time for vacations or golf FYI.  64 million dollars worth of YOUR money thus far for his golf outings.  Hope he's sending you all a thank you note."
"Trump definitely likes when they're tagged and bagged. "

'Right to the point. I love this man.'
'Donald quickly associating himself with the winning and successful side. Im sure there is some Scott Adams master persuader  type stuff going on with this tweet. Great job law enforcement!'
"One thing that really appeals to me about Trump is the respect and encouragement for the emergency services. In the UK, the government does everything possible to kick them down and slam them at every opportunity, it's a disgrace. Trump makes people feel like he is one of the people who appreciates the normal hard workers trying to keep everyone safe, rather than some jumped up politician sat in his ivory tower."

"Don't be fooled, the Democrats have always been like this if you look into their real history. Over the years they have been Buffalo Billing identities to hide their true motives, Trump simply ripped off their skin suit. Their prime directive has always been power consolidation by any means necessary."
'A lot of folks here in the south were old time democrats including my grandparents. Reagan changed that for then and many many other folks. I feel like we are on the edge of another swing of that sorts only country wide considering how far from their base liberalism has pushed the Dem party.

"He isnt lying. Dems were calling for Trump's impeachment a few weeks after the inaugural. Made zero sense. The instant gratification generarion indeed. "
"See, if the Democrat Party had not polluted itself, tell me that the Trump family wouldn't have been a Democrat family, the likes of the Kennedy's. \n\nDamn right they would. \n\nThe Democrats are 100% responsible for the creation of Donald J.

'He’s blowing up the entire free trade narrative of the last 30 years. All “free trade” has done is hollow out the middle class here and enrich corrupt bureaucrats in emerging markets. \n\nWhen are the people of the EU going to realize they’ve been sold down the same free trade river? Youth unemployment in Southern Europe is astoundingly high. '
'I never thought it would be possible to love my president so much! 😍😘'
"The thing that's really great about all of this is, he gave plenty of notice that the rules had changed, that he expected fair trade.  He asked nicely to renegotiate to more fair terms for the US.  Hell, he complimented the other countries on making great deals (for them) with the US.  He was as diplomatic and courteous as he could be, and got.....nothing.  And now they are shocked that Trump is lobbing mortars and showing them the MOAB's.  \n\nThese folks need to just accept the unfair advantage they had for decades, and agree to be fair going forward.  Trump doesn't bluff."

'Hey would ya look at that, a President standing up for American workers! Now over to Bill with what do Liberals think....They think trade deficits are good?

That’s what kids do. They are like scared little rodents who flinch at everything. This places needs to be weeded, badly. Shit like this, unfortunate as it is, helps to do that. The main mods need to step up way more. I personally just don’t think they care as much as they use to because they most likely get some sort of income or incentive other than fighting for our great country out of it. Drain The Donald.'

'Oh yeah, this was me in 5th grade as safety patrol. It was an honor to raise the flag every morning. At the end, it was tough giving up that post at the end of the school year.'
'I once watched through a window as four Marines lowered and folded a flag in a heavy snow in a deserted compound on a holiday weekend.  Salutes, facing movements, the whole deal.  They were the only people around.  I have never forgotten that moment.  Good on these kids for doing it right.'
"OU can raise your boys to think they're a girl, or you can raise your boys to act in the honor of men. They don't realize the respect they give probably, but good for them."
'I used to be one of three students that helped raise and lower the flag back in middle school, it felt nice to have some sense of shared responsibility and being able to properly honor the flag.'
'This was a great story.'
'I did it and it was actually kind of fun. We were given little hand held stop signs and helped kids across the crosswalk (even though there were lights that any kid could push themselves). You showed up thirty minutes before school and stayed thirty minutes after school. The kids in the front of the school also handled the flag (raising and lowering/folding). Every kid wanted the street on the back because it was super shady and there were a lot of trees, flowers, etc. (just a really green and beautiful place). You basically just hung out with a friend and talked while doing the "duties". (We also got donuts in the morning and at the end of the year the kids that volunteered got to spend a day at an arcade and get free pizza.)\n\n'
'In 6th grade I pulled the captain\'s badge out of a hat, and was in charge of doing "rounds".  Ah, my first delicious taste of power.  Chewing out my fellow officers for not being at their posts.  Yelling at kids for cutting across the grass...\n\nDelicious, delicious *power*!'
"Ahhh. I was a sergeant in the safety patrol. I loved when it was our week to raise and lower the flag. Whenever I'm asked if I have any leadership experience, I always refer back to that post. But those were the days when the belts were orange and  not that stupid green color. Awesome kids btw"
'It was not one Muslim terrorist. It was like half a dozen.'
"All muslims follow the same pedophile warlord and read the same toilet paper book that tells them to behave like feral 3rd world sub-humans. Trump voters come from all races, religions and creeds and focus on their desire to make our country a better place. It's not even a valid comparison."

Their logic smackdowns are fantastic and very informative. \n\nThe best part is, with the camera off, these 2 smile all the time. I love seeing them in pics not part of their show or act, and they just smile huge. Like they won the social lottery or something. Fucking big ass smiles that just make you want to hug them and thank them for being a part of the USA.'

Different \'side,\' same playbook.\n\nUnfortunately leftists rarely expose these bad actor sorts because they\'re so afraid of "breaking solidarity," when it comes to outing each other over _serious_ matters they\'re actually quite reluctant so it\'s much easier to pull the ol\' "bavarian fire drill," especially if they push themselves into an "unassailable position of oppression" like Ms Sarsour has done stateside.'

'Expect both sides to be SUPER against this. Both sides weaponize their security clearances for their own gain. BOTH sides run to the media to be unnamed sources. BOTH sides of the media will push this as a politically charged attack against his critics for "simply speaking their minds". All media that uses ANY former administration official either officially or unofficially, will be pissed. Fox may not have a ton of these guys at the moment, but they know, if Trump gets his way here, the next Dem President will revoke security clearances of all exiting Trump officials, and Fox won\'t have the goods, like MSNBC and CNN have right now.\n\nFUCK.

'galactus417 said - "I think the correct term is \'surveillance\'. Wiretapping gives the connotation that it was somehow an illegal action. Everything was done legally and under the direction of the US courts. Manafort was under surveillance because he\'s more than likely up to something illegal.\nI\'m sure this comment will be deleted by the mods because this doesn\'t fit with the echo chamber in this sub. Just keep in mind removing the voice of the opposition is the M.O. people who know their arguments are full of shit. It\'d be interesting to see if you guys could actually defend your position intelligently instead of spinning the truth all the time."\n\nMy reply:\nSomething doesn\'t add up though. Trump has been legally "surveilled" for years now, yet we have leaks about a Russian Dossier? Nah, I don\'t buy it. You can\'t both legally surveil and illegally leak (and get away with it). Getting out of hand here, if you want to claim it was legal, along with the Trump spying, then show me what you found. Nothing was found, but just for our protection?\n\nAnd on the other hand we have Hillary and Podesta, openly involved with Russia (e.g. Uranium sale) and that is ok? Seems to me that we have two standards.\n\nAnd talk about an echo chamber, on the politics forum you can\'t talk about Trump or bots will downvote you and/or remove posts. That is relegated to a free speech forum known as The Donald. Again, what is wrong with this picture?'
'But is there a clear connection to obama that can be proven? As I understand, only the justice department did the wiretapping. Which has nothing to do with Obama, at least on first glance. \n\nIs there proof Obama knew about it / ordered it ?'

'I like Paul Manafort but was he really the only person who could have protected Candidate Trump\'s interest during the convention - or was he a convenient up-and-running wiretap warrant?  \n\nWho was the boot-licking toady at the FBI who realized that all they had to do was reopen the Manafort investigation and get Trump to hire him?  Maybe Trump and Manafort had even discussed the possibility in a wiretapped conversation when the investigation of Manafort was still legitimate and the sneaky toady didn\'t even think of it himself. \n\nWho are ya FBI toady man?    You were brave enough to do it and take the bows among your fellow toadies, but are you brave enough to own it among us all?  \n\nGeneral Kelly has publicly owned his DACA connivance, what are you made of you odious functionary posing as an FBI agent?

'"Rigged system, or just a double standard?"\n\nA great example of the presumptive close.

'Love my President.'
'Folks who have been criticizing Sessions for not doing anything are unaware the he has been completely restructuring and transforming the DOJ so when the time is nigh to bring the Obama/Clinton conspirators to justice the DOJ will function like a well oiled precision machine. Trump has been greatly assisting this effort by quietly filling vacancies in the Federal court systems with young deeply conservative judges. The recent judgement against Leandra English and her claim to head the CFPB by a Trump placed district judge is a prime example of the benefits of them preparing the system to work in their favor. The foundation of justice has to be solid for justice to be served. Time is on Trump and Sessions side and they are going to make sure they do it right.'
"Don't forgot Comey wrote letter absolving her before interview even took case.  Proof positive if this was a case - which it should be.  \n.  \nIt's a myth that only government prosecutors are suppose to bring charges forward in the modern - corrupted - legal system.  If the charges are against government officials, this completely fails.  Under the original (and real) American system, anyone could bring charges before a grand jury - this is called private prosecution, or the grand jury itself could investigate without a government ok.  The grand jury is tasked with investigating any criminal conduct it has knowledge of, not if they get permission from the government.  In this aspect, the grand jury is suppose to have more power then an appointed prosecutor."

'I hope our small firm can benefit from this. Currently our costs have doubled from $15K to $32K per year per family including deductibles. Before the unaffordable Affordable Care Act was forced downs our throats by the CORRUPT DEMOCRAT MACHINE our insurance cost $15K from Aetna who we were happy with. In the first year Aetna sent us a bill for $28K plus $10K deductibles for a total $38K per family. Hardly a premium reduction. Then two of our doctors left. We ended up with the fake non-profit Horizon BCBS who sent us a 41% premium increase in 2017 and we are healthy. Horizon has gouged small businesses for years and during the last year built a $3 billion surplus (earnings) on $11 billion in revenue. Not bad for a non-profit. Now Aetna and about 10 other carriers fled NJ completely. There are two carriers left for small business and they are raking it in. Cost after deductibles for two people (husband and wife) $32K.

'HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FUCKING BRILLIANT'
'It\'s awesome, because it truly makes no difference one way or the other how this gets handled.  Trump will solve the problem that nobody else would touch... again.. and the liberal media will only find a hundred different ways to spin it into Trump being "literally Hitler"... again.  \n\nSo who fucking cares what the perpetual outrage media thinks?

'This man has made it easy for us to explain the truth to our lost, but fellow citizens. All we have to do is ask them to rebut this point.

Let them red pill or wear themselves out (whichever comes first). '
'please god end daca!\n\n\nIf we can send back the daca recipients id be so happy. I pray to God that Trump delivers us from evil and protects this great nation.\n\n\nThose daca kids are so fucking smug.

God bless'
'lmao I fucking love it.'
"It's a win for Trump if it dies. He can let them go and create some special merit-based category for a small percentage. In particular, if any served in the military they can fast-track some permanent residence. \n\nHe won't lose. Surveys and tests and examples show over and over he only gains favor by deporting people. Its a win. It wins and there is very very little political backlash. \n\n200,000 Salvadorians lost their recurring-temporary visas. After 17 years for some of them. There has been zero public outcry outside of hardcore leftists who hate Trump anyways."
"Good riddance.\n\nLook at Reagan's amnesty and what it did to the west coast.  DACA would've meant millions of Hispanic kids who would've grown up to vote Democrat to bring more of their family over and then had kids who also would've voted the same way etc. etc.  \n\nChain migration is a powerful thing."

'# NFL? More like LOL\n\nAgain, praise Kek.'
'Chapter 6 my good man. Chapter 6.  \nTrump will not rest until his revenge is satisfied.   Praise Kek, we are blessed. '
'WTF?! I love corporate welfare now!'
"I'm really confused why anyone cares about this NFL thing.\n\nSo it is disrespectful (I guess). So what? Who cares? Seriously why does *anyone* care? LIke most things, the faux outrage over this is far worse than the actual thing.\n\nBut I do agree with the tax law changes. Unrelated, however."
"It's great that we're celebrating Trump's tweet! The first step to enacting a law is getting attention to it. Keep it up guys!!"

"Oops, it looks like Trump's magic wand is bigger than Obama's... again!\n\nAren't you ashamed of yourself, Obama, considering that you are a (half) black man? ;p"
'Also note that the only time coverage is positive is when he’s “advancing President Barack Obama’s initiative”. It’s like they’re saying well, Obama would’ve gotten this done anyway given a third or fourth term.'

"Who cares if he's effective? The important thing is that\n\n#DRUMPF HURT MUH FEE-FEES!! PEACH MINTS!!"
"He wanted to be president of the world. To him, the US was a big rich country that could spread its wealth to serve the rest of the world. That the US owed the world something. At least that's what I think. "

'What do you mean "where is the justice dept?" They work for you, Daddy! call em into the oval and crack the whip!!'
'Justice Dept was being run by another traitor, Loretta Lynch. She needs to swing from a rope like Killary and Obama... \n\nTRAITORS IN OUR MIDST, PEOPLE.'
'Yes trump, WHERE IS THE JUSTICE DEPT?????'
"Where is the Justice Department?  On the other end of your phone Mr. President.  Why not give them a shout and see what's going on?  They serve at your pleasure and I really hope this tweet is some kind of ploy."
"This has to be the final straw for Trump.  He hasn't been shy about replacing people so far so let's hope the search committee is finding replacements.  "
"It's been known, among a lot of people my age who like history, that England passed the torch of the pay for play scheme along after WWII. The reason behind WW1 was England not allowing Germany or Russia to enter the world theater by expanding their economy or influence. The Democrats have continued to only allow Russia to participate IF they take their back alley deals, thus the sanctions. Russia made a power play and the DNC hammered them to keep Russia from making any move they don't approve of. \n\nThe result is Russia only knowing one way to deal with the US. Either by meddling in the Middle East and causing headaches for us or by crooked politics. Not saying they are innocent and we are all to blame but Clinton's involvement with Russia is hardly a surprise. "
'> They can’t win on their terrible policies, so they view them as potential voters! \n\n#HELL YES!!! THIS MADMAN FINALLY SAID IT!!!'
"I'm just glad hes bringing up the fact that they are simply importing voters.\n\nThe natives are largely not stupid enough to vote Dem, so they have to illegally import a new electorate. "
'Sweet jesus, he is really giving ‘em both barrels today.'
'He said it. He finally said its all just about voters. I love it.'
'I love that Trump is finally saying what we’ve been saying for years.'
'Why do people advocate for allowing illegals in? Immigration into the United States should be a privilege, not a right.'
"Liberals rejoice, unlike anyone you would have elected, Trump is actually proposing a solution to end the practice of separating children from their 'parents' at the border. I'm sure you know by this point that this practice has been going on to a much greater extent for many years prior to the Trump admin. That's somewhat irrelevant I can agree, but your unwillingness to support an actual fix to the issue really, really betrays to sensible people how ingenuine your supposed heightened compassion really is. Trump's solution may not be ideal in your eyes, but it is a comparatively cheap, effective and proven solution that has many other benefits. In a less insane time I'd like to believe that your supposed heightened sense of compassion would lead you to concede to the plan of a legitimately elected president for the sake of the separated children rather than jump from thinly veiled outrage to outrage. In a weeks time this story will recede out of your consciousness, just like the 'seven days' hate' receded out of your consciousness last week. No ground will support your standing because it melts away beneath you under the lightest amount of scrutiny. Therefore you jump from unstable island to island, desperately searching for some saving grace; some miniscule bit of leverage to supplant the formless, amorphous, capricious value system you ironically call universal morality."
"lol he couldn't be more direct, that's why we love him."
'So glad he said this. Securing our vote is the issue of our time. '
'In England, the law prohibits illegals from working, renting an apartment, holding a bank account, or getting any government benefits whatsoever.  And, landlords are required to verify that their tenants are not illegal.  GEOTUS is right, only in America are the immigration laws so lax and stupid!'
'Brilliant tweet!'
"Can we just take a second to appreciate how this guy withstands the torrent of hate after every tweet he makes? I know it's literally every tweet but right now I've had a few and the appreciation is really sinking in. I can humbly say that if that much hate was directed at me I wouldn't be able to withstand it.\n\nWhether you're a pede or a hardcore liberal, any intelligent person can recognize deep down that it takes a special kind of person to persevere through the colossal wall of vitriol...\n\nI donno man. Never seen someone tested like this before. He hasn't cracked yet."
'We actually have a chief executive who acts like he is in charge of the executive branch of government. I have never seen anything like this. Holy shit.'
'Need to end the FBI and figure out a way to let the state law enforcements the ability to easily share data. Then power will be decentralized enough so the DC politicians have a hard time corrupting them.'
'I have not mentioned how much I love President Trump this week, until now.\n\nMy fucking hero.'
'Lol it’s like he browse this sub...'
'I love this guy, and I’m not even American. '
"This is the most transparent political organization we've ever had. Literally doing the math on twitter for everyone to make sense exactly what is going on. I'm so proud of this president"
'ACKHCUALLY.... The tariff imbalance is much worse because China is a defacto member of NAFTA. They send their shitty parts to Mexico with no tariffs, the Mexicans use those parts to make "American" cars, then they send them free of charge over to the US. \n\nI can\'t tell you the size of the freedom boner I get when I see POTUS talking like this. Yes, it\'ll probably suck at first but once we figure it out and, believe me, we will, the economy is going to take off like a rocket! '
'Trump Tariffs will set things right.  We love you Mr President, you are doing an AWESOME job draining the swamp and purging the creatures within!  '
"Best prez since Teddy Roosevelt. And Roosevelt's time he was considered a progressive because he wasn't afraid to take on the monopolies of his time, Trump is no different standing up to Amazon hopefully he can take on Twitter Google and in Facebook too. "

'6:03am in Washington DC. President Trump is already up and working for the USA! You got to love it!'

'Since /u/theUltimateSean seems to be only interested in insulting you...  Here\'s an actual answer to your question.\n\nHe was a member of the Republican Committee of Chester County.  This means he was one of [465 members of a committee](https://republicanccc.com/republican-team/committee) that served Chester County, Pennsylvania\'s Republican voters.  Specifically, Mr. Jennings served [area 20](https://republicanccc.com/republican-team/committee/area-20), in position #270.\n\n>Committee people are a consituent\'s contact for any questions, comments, or information regarding Republican candidates or the committee.

'LOL we are winning so much the left is meme-ing trump FOR us, they really are masochists who relish in pain.'
"This is the best display of meme skills I've seen from them. Hilarious!"
"It's just like the Trump Chicken. The left cannot have a sense of humor, as they believe that a joke that offends someone (who in their eyes is not in power) must be banned. Not once have I seen them adopt a joke make of Hilary. Everything must be dead serious, because humor can make even the worst situations bareable and then they cease to have a purpose for the expansion of control that they desire. It's why the left can't meme. On the other hand, Tumps movement is built upon making laughter as a way to build support. At its core, it is a positive movement rather than a negative one. "
"The left doesn't seem to understand that we have a sense of humor, they act like we're the ones who get triggered all the time.\n\nLong live the God Emperor! For Trump and Country!"

"Just shows how impulsive Democrats have become. \n\nDisorganized, salty, and slow on their feet. \n\nIt's become very annoying trying to extend intellectual credence debating their hypocritical, redundant, and malicious banter.

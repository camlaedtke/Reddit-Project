The government already robs them of far too much money, and for what? More wars and invasions? Health care for every single person who walks into this country? Free college education for any student with a pulse? How altruistic and naive must one become before realizing that you cannot finance your pet projects and bleeding heart fantasies off of the backs of people who work fourteen hours a day? '

'How is cutting taxes to the privledged rich, a gain to the middle and poor classes?'
'As has been mentioned elsewhere in this thread, this debate always hinges on what "rich" means in 2017 America, who\'s defining it, and how.\n\nA true populist (as opposed to a pandering politician) would set it at something like a household AGI of $1M at a minimum. It should arguably be higher than that, but anything less than that is a nonstarter. \n\nAs was also mentioned, strange as it may sound to someone just scraping by on minimum wage in Middle America, there are plenty of areas of the country where a household income of $225K or $275K or $310K certainly don\'t feel very "rich" once you consider property taxes, a mortgage, college funds for your kids, transportation, etc.\n\nSo this conversation starts at 1 million dollars, nothing less. It really isn\'t that complicated, from a political standpoint. '
'Believe it!! Trump REALLY mean EVERYTHING he says. EVERYTHING!! TREMENDOUS!!!! He has the best words!! North korea will face fire and fury the likes of which have never been seen before, EVAR!!!!!'
"Somehow I missed his campaign speech promising to cut taxes for the rich only.. although this fabled speech had been repeated over and over by liberals.. \n\nIf 1% gets all the tax cuts I don't think he would be elected because then it would be 99-1.. he cares about all Americans \n\n"

"Wait didn't trump have in his tax plan that he released on his website a reduction in the top tax rate from 39% to 25%.\n\n[source] (https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/trump-tax-reform.pdf)\n\nim just confused."
"This is one of the few things I'm optimistic on given that corporations stand to gain bigly from a lower tax rate and tax repatriation incentives."

"CNN just needs to come out and say they're the Democratic News Network. It's like that gay kid everyone knows is gay but they're still pretending. You're just waiting for them to announce it and then pretend to be surprised. "
"Antifa reeks of a CIA op. I wouldn't be in the least bit surprised if the majority of them were actually moussad contracted by the rogue elements of the intelligence communities to maintain plausible deniability. \n\nHas anyone any anecdotal evidence as to whether or not they're real? As in does anyone actually know any real antifa, associate with them, are friends with any? Why are these guys not being interviewed, can anyone even name any of them? These guys are like ghosts. The whole damn thing reminds me of that old Chuck Norris movie Invasion USA. The premise was that a small number of soviet terrorists come to America and start staging a series of false flag events to turn the people against eachother to incite civil war.\n\nAntifa didn't count on Trump calling them out by name, the key to their power lay in their anonymity. Now they have been exposed, we'll see them and the fake news mafia scurry and scuttle  like the cockroaches that they are."

They'd invested so much in this nifty demographics technology to let you know precisely which districts had voted which way in the past and were trying to be 'unbiased' because they all thought Hillary would win.\n\n It was fun watching them pressing all those little screens as the results became painfully clear that the swing states were swinging right into DJT's open arms. The whole night was magical in a weird way, sitting there with popcorn and some rootbeer, watching Hillary overtake in Florida, then Donald then Hillary again, then finally Donald. Once CNN started realizing even the 'firewall' states were swinging red, they stopped showing the electoral map at all, and just cut to Van Jones and his infamous 'white lash' comment. \n\nThe next few hours was the liberal panel complaining how butthurt they were, and Pennsylvania stuck at 99% for 7 hours.

They'll have theirs, you'll have yours, and I'll have mine -- and together we'll be fine. "
'It\'s so disgusting listening to all these so called journalists bashing Trump and the WH for banning one lousy "reporter" from an event. They act like it\'s an attack on the free press when there were plenty of other reporters there. Those that cover the WH don\'t have the right to be there in that capacity. It is a privilege and if you act like an ungrateful brat, you should lose that privilege. It\'s not like all reporters were banned and things are being kept secret. Trump is the most accessible and transparent of any President in my lifetime by far. Just another phony thing for the media to whine about, but they are all perfectly fine with banning people from social media if they say something they consider wrong. I\'d argue it\'s far more important for citizens to be able to express themselves freely online than it is for 1 shitty reporter to have privileged access to the WH. '

The agents went to Berlin to drop off the cash.  The Russian took the cash and ran without saying anything.\n\nIn other words this Russian bilked our intelligence services out of $100k in exchange for nothing."
'But we need to increase the budget 20%???????????????????????????'
'Was an opportunity to cash in for sleazy Russian entrepreneurs - selling bullshit tabloid stories on Donald Trump to a cabal-scheming HRC/DNC Democrats and their Obama administration Deep State cohorts.\n\nKind of like the recent punking of Democrat Rep. Schiff where two Russian journalist easily hijink their way into getting direct access to Schiff, recording the conversation, in which Schiff is desperately anxious to get his hands on Trump nudes that they claim they are peddling. (This little vignette is essentially a kind of a microcosm of the entire Russian narrative that has slow drip unwound over the last year.)\n\nIn the case of Schiff, he was motivated by desperation as his *"Muh Russian"* narrative had gone down in flames. Whereas HRC/DNC-Dems, Obama-admin/Deep-State were entirely motivated by a malicious and seditious intent from the get go - first political opposition spying and then that quickly morphing into a conspiracy of coup de\'tat post election.\n\nOf course, as more unravels on the Hillary Clinton collusion with the Russian govt. per the Uranium One scandal, and how Carter Page was a one time FBI asset in 2013 and then FBI flipped and began using him as a patsy so FBI could get a pretext to spy on Trump campaign (and then the Trump administration), it is looking like HRC has been working closely with the Russian govt. all along. So the tabloid trash that Steel put into the FusionGPS dossier really could have been fed in part by his Russian sources that were operating in their intelligence apparatus. Steel certainly never made and effort to meet and verify his sources, nor did the FBI, which took on his info and used it without verification to get FISA warrants.'

Economic nationalism was what Trump initially ran on and that sort of ‚Äútake care of our own‚Äù populism had some crossover appeal with Bernie voters. \n\nIn my recent conversations with American black males,  two things stick out. They tend to be socially moderate or conservative, while embracing economic populism. One ex Army male I spoke with was downright nationalist. He was fed up with the situation where people from central and east Asia are promised money and stipends here because the military paid them off for using their land to stage military operations. He was pissed that we give money to people who have no interest in assimilating - yet ignore our own. \n\nIf Republicans can build bridges to socially moderate black males and females, and their churches, we will find good allies.  \n\nBLM isn‚Äôt really aligned with Antifa.

"And of course, they release a senate investigation that concludes that Russia did indeed interfere in the election (in vague ways) on the same day this news comes out. Keeping the Russia-Trump collusion dream alive.\n\nIt's basically what Trump had said all along. Russia may or may not have done some stuff in the election.

People have different political opinions and thats fine but the goal should be MAGA!

One example that comes to mind is that other political and news subreddits were very in favor of America leaving TPP and reworking trade deals to protect American workers.  But when Trump did it, they changed their tune in a hurry - at that point it's being hostile toward our allies and starting a trade war.  -_-"

'Nunes, a re-founding Father. Good Shepherds FTW.'
"Nunes is on the Rush Limbaugh show. He wants to keep investigating Russian collusion. And since we haven't found any Trump collusion, the focus should be on Clinton. LMAO... they are flipping the Russia investigation back in their face. Now it makes sense why Trey Gowdy wants to keep it going. They are going to force Mueller's hand. "

'Weather report for Sunday: Cloudy with a chance of a Trump Tweet Storm!'
'RIP Seth Rich'
'TO THE TOP OF REDDIT!!!'
'Is smoking gun evidence of Seth Rich taking the emails on that server so they hired a fake company to concoct a different narrative. Where the hell is the server right now?  Why isn\'t the intelligence community interested in what "Russian hacking" looks like? It\'s like the allies not being interested in the found Nazi radio that broke the Enigma code.'
'The wheels of justice move at a slow pace, pedes. They have to make sure there are no holes in there cases. The fact that the swampers are making insignificant moves at a fast pace shows their hand. This is weak bait for Trump. He is surrounded by people who are masters of this game. I am not worried by this. We just have to weather the Storm. '
'Even at 6\'8" Comey manages to come up small. He was a disaster as the FBI Director as he politicized a once proud institution. He broke all the rules of leadership, integrity, and Justice. He now continues to embarrass himself, the agency,and the DOJ. He writes a book to talk about tie length? Clearly he is unhinged and deserved firing.'
'Yes !   Hahhhahahhah. (Jail)'
"So our President knows full well that Mr. Weasel Comey exonerated Hillary before she or her aides were even interviewed. Keep in mind, Hillary wasn't even fucking under oath by the FBI, nor was Mr. Comey in the room with such a high profile target. How ridiculous is that? \n\nThis whole thing stinks to high heaven, it's going to take a lot of Drain-o to get this swamp drained."
'God Bless our President'
'OK AG Sessions. Your turn. You along with the new FBI Chief must have something. FoundaIts about time WE take back the narrative in DC. tion, Bill, Huma, Chelsea.....something. '

'MSM scurrying like cockroaches in an attempt to downplay this Comey tidbit...'
"this is exactly what happens when you don't play the game folks...  \n\nEnter in a special prosecutor who can now pardon and manipulate the law"
'Because they wanted Hillary to win and they rigged absolutely everything against Trump'
"Obama,  MSM & friends all thought they rigged the election enough for Hillary that they didn't give a shit about no russian collusion until it bit them in the ass."
"He's got a point.\n\nObama told them to step down, then went around telling everyone the election couldn't be rigged.\n\nIf there was an American who colluded with the Russians to fix the election for Trump, it looks like it was Barack Obama."
'How does anyone know that the Russian military hacked the DNC or Hilary if they never had access to the server? His name was Seth Rich. '
"Because they never thought she'd lose the (rigged) election"
'The cyber security team responsible for protecting America‚Äôs infrastructure was told to ‚Äú stand down‚Äù by team obama so they‚Äôd have incidents to frame trump for Russia collusion. This was their plan all along. '
'By allowing the crimes to be committed they had an insurance policy in case Trump won.\n\n'
"It's a red herring. Like the WMDs in Iraq. It's all false.   \n"
'Not just informed Obama, FBI and other agencies were ready to expand the investigation and produce indictments, but were TOLD TO STAND DOWN. '
'Truth bomb!'
'Seriously.  Good tweet Mr. President.  '
'Because they thought Hillary was going to win and the failsafe was to blame everything on Trump.'
'Mueller needs to investigate Obama giving Russians access to our government data. https://www.newsandtimes.com/politics/2018/07/obama-admin-gave-greenlight-to-russian-firm-used-in-maryland-elections/'
"Because Obamao wouldn't have had the opportunity to run his mouth in October.  And November. And so on..."
'Looks like they just helped create another solution in the Trump Administration to a problem from the Obama Administration.  Can they destroy themselves any faster?  when a President wants a safe and secure country could they possibly, in their angst to destroy him, play into his hands and give him what he campaigned on any more than this?'
'Keep Tweeting this info out Mr. President. Our truth detector.'
'ü§î..... good question.'
"because charging 12 russians  who will be disappeared by  the next day and never see a day in court isn't really going to accomplish anything unless you are just putting on a show and Obama didn't want anyone to be able to question the results when the sure thing hillary took office. "
"Because that would make them racist\nBecause they wanted Hillary to win, and are still sucking their thumbs over it\nBecause they lack integrity\nBecause they didn't think anyone would find out\nBecause they thought Hillary would win."
'I hope Trump shoves this in the faces of every single person that criticized him for saying he was wire tapped. I hope he mentions it every god damn day for the next 8 years. '
"It's almost like Trump was right about Trump Tower being wiretapped and his campaign being spied on... \n\n\u2003\u2003 \n\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to add that Manafort at the time was Trump's campaign chairman. Every private conversations between Trump and Manafort were wiretapped. That's essentially the same as wiretapping Trump.  And the fact that we are only just learning about Manafort now means there's probably more Trump associates living in Trump tower who were all wiretapped similarly by the Obama administration. "
'there is some fuckery afoot. I saw that CNN was reporting this, they only report the truth when they have to cover up a bigger lie. Wonder what that bigger lie is? '
'So, I was privy to many of those conversations. Nothing bad of course... Mainly delegate situation. '
'Ya, but did obama himself personally enter trump tower and physically do the wiretapping on campaign staff or trump lines? Mental gymnastics keep reaching new levels. '
'There seriously needs to be a special prosecutor.\n\nPaging jeff sessions.... '
'Seems like mueller zeroing in on manafort to justify his existence '
'Trump was right all along. Can we not stop winning?'
'Liberals and deep state aficionados will try to point out that there was some kind of "probable cause" to justify a warrant for these wiretaps.  Let\'s not forget that the real news here is that Trump was right about being wiretapped - even if it technically wasn\'t him and was an employee under investigation!'

"Totally. Every time I hear people now saying the Republican party is in disarray, WHO GIVES A FUCK. We're tired of the 2 party ruling class government system. Even though President Dr. Donald Trump ran as a republican, I believe he is truly our first real third party candidate. He's not in anyone's pocket, he's not bound to their partisan games, people are tired of both parties, we are thrilled right now, and they still don't get it. Until the media elite acknowledge and understand that they lost, they will never understand why Dr. President Donald Trump won."

This Q dude on 4chan/8ch appears to be correct so far... and the book really is nothing more than a compilation of the bullshit we heard all last year that has been debunked. The author notes in his prologue the book is not completely truth lol... and then Trumps tweets.. it just all seems like a cosmic joke. He made a ‚Äòsad!‚Äô Tweet about it this AM... trump only does ‚Äòsad!‚Äô Tweets when he is being sarcastic/sardonic....... \n\n\nI can‚Äôt wait to see how this all ends and I am betting like every other time, Trump comes out looking like a champ.

"Whether anyone agrees with his religious views or not or is creeped out by his taste for dating girls half his age, Moore's long history of blatant judicial activism should disqualify him from getting anywhere near elected office regardless of party affiliation.\n\n"
"Kind of implies that Moore was not a good candidate.\n\nThis is important guys.  Picking the most conservative or far right candidate isn't enough to drain the swamp.  We need people with skill.  People that can navigate the political landscape and win.  That wasn't Moore.  He was completely tone deaf and flat on his feet.  The Trump movement is a big tent, and populists need to learn that allies don't need to agree with them 100%."
"Absolutely.\n\nPA 'pedes, who's the favorite for the primaries in 2018? Barletta?"
'I believe in cycle of good and bad. \n\nSomething good must be coming our way '
'I hate to say I told yall so but I\'m literally from Alabama and kept saying "pedes, what are you doing? GEOTUS says vote Strange but you\'re all talking about voting Moore?"\n\nAnd all I heard was "lol think for yourself"\n\nAre we trump supporters or not? Next time he tells you to vote Strange, vote fucking Strange.\n(Or whatever the next equivalent is)'
"What is done is done. \n\nWe have lost one seat, our aim is 60 seats. We shall start planning right now , how to protect our 51 seats and gain 9 seats in 2018\n\nDon't listen to anyone else. Trump has the correct intuition. Infighting gives advantage to the enemy. \n "
"He's absolutely correct. Unsubstantiated allegations notwithstanding, there were significant problems with Moore as a candidate. We *cannot* continue running candidates that are caricatures of what leftists think conservatives are. Roy Moore was a backwards thinking, evolution-denying, Bible thumping loon who believes the Constitution is second to his interpretation of Scripture. I am a Christian, but your faith CANNOT be a cornerstone of your campaign and CANNOT be a substitute for an argument.\n\nFurthermore, leftists will continue substituting arguments with allegations that are nearly impossible to prove. They now know they can try this and WIN. The best course of action is to call them out on it, deny it, and throw it back in their faces. They don't care about sexual abuse. That much is clear based on their history. Let's let them know we consider this a war as well, because they sure do."
'so, roy moore was the establishment pick, because they know so much more about politics and have better instincts than Trump, right?\n\nMaybe this will finally get them to shut up and learn'
"He's right.  Some of these liberal Republicans have to go.  Because look at what Trump has accomplished in 10 months, if we had more of those kind of Republican's this country could turn around in a shorter period of time that even previously imagined.   "
'Moore sucked.\n\nWe can do better. Trump was right with Strange.'
'What, like how everyone should have backed Luther Strange?'
"Interesting that Jones won by 20K votes and there were 22K write-in votes. Combined with unusual turnout this is an odd result. Maybe Moore lost fair and square but it's worth an audit. "
"Loophole, the first guy in Trump's comments is false advertising hahaha"
'His responses to this loss have been amazing. '
'Those dems getting a false sense of confidence that anything is possible. \nMAGA!'
"What's wrong with Ronnie? He was a great candidate!"

'GEOTUS is the only one I trust. He is 100% on point with his comment. '
'So fucking grateful this guy is president.'
"Why can't he just fire everyone above basic agent and start over at the FBI? "

"A 500,000 RMB BMW imported from Germany is sold at 1,400,000 RMB in China. Chinese government makes 900,000 RMB for exploiting Chinese people and fucking with WTO rules. Want to avoid those taxes? Build your car in China. However, every imported component will still be taxed at 13% and if your car has over 60% imported component, it's considered imported and a 140% tariff and tax is in place. So the only way to make American car competitive in China is give them technology to make components and build a factory in China and help China grow GDP. God, commies are smart. "
'Are there even any good chinese car brands?'

"One of my favourite things about the Trump admin is how it makes you stop and think about your politicians and if they have the merit to be there. You've gotta think to yourself do they actually know what they are doing, for example in regards to things like deals and business."
"So how's the left spinning this? White privilege tax?"
'Finally someone who cares'
'Free and  reciprocal trade '

"Top response is criticizing him writing 1/2% instead of .5%...Well voice to text writes it the same way our president wrote it so maybe he's just being more efficient using voice to text :)"
"True it is unfair trade and those tariff's are very unbalanced, but we shouldn't be spiking them up all at once to match China. It's a delicate system and that is a very big disruption, the ideal solution would be to get China to lower there tarrifs. If you're going to raise them do it gradually so businesses can adjust."
'We need a list of all the former government officials, law firms and lobbyists getting rich from China.\n'
'Never forget. China runs on US money. China owns large stakes in US companies. If the US does bad so does China.\n\nIf the tarrifs hit the Chinese owned US business the oligarchs revolt. If the tarrifs hit the working Chinaman, they will revolt.\n\nThe US wins each time.'
'#WTF I LOVE STUPID TRADE NOW!'
"Yeah boy let's get china."
'Once again, Trump is one of the most honest president in modern history.'
"Yeah and think of all the cheap Chinese refurbished parts they're going to make and sell us for cheap!  Not to mention when there are so many more american cars on the market how cheap ours are going to be!"
'yet "true conservatives" will tell us otherwise'
'Bingo.  We are being taken advantage of (to put it mildly).  Time to put an end to this crap.'
"i mean does anyone here own or know anyone who owns a chinese car? i'm sure we could tax them at 100% and the number of chinese cars owned by americans will remain relatively unchanged."

'> he didn\'t drive a few states over to commit the crime.\n\n\nThere is zero proof that the guy drove a few states to specifically commit that crime with his car.  It could have definitely been a "in the heat of the moment" thing.  However, the anti-trump guy had a premeditated plan to murder.'

'Democrats had several years to "fix DACA", let only they said they were focusing on it since September 2017. http://archive.is/4Cs6Y\n\nDemocrats can\'t solve DACA even if they were to 100% focus all their effort into it - even if they started last year!\n\nT-minus 10 days until DACA dies. \n\nEnjoy the slow burn, pedes '
'He never ceases to amaze me, I love our madman'
'Start the trucks.  It is deporting season.   Start rewarding community members who turn in illegals.'
'They can only do one smear campaign at a time. They don‚Äôt have the energy, or the intellect, or the multi tasking skills to talk about DACA and guns at the same time. Now would be a good time to just drop Obamacare. They won‚Äôt even remember it. '
'Hopefully the media will take a breather from organizing to repeal the 2A for a few days while they organize for amnesty as these people get deported.'
'But dems care about the dreamers! (They don‚Äôt)'
"It's obvious that the Democrats are desperately scrambling in search of an issue that will get them some traction.  This is difficult for them to do, because they are genuinely opposed to essentially all policies that would help normal Americans.  If they continue to find no issue that resonates with voters, expect the 2018 elections to be nothing but personal attacks from them.  It will be all they have to run on.  "
'I predict they will suddenly care next week as we get close to expiry, and then obstruct as usual.'
'To be fair, so have I Mr. President. '
'He‚Äôs a bucket getter. Doesn‚Äôt miss a chance for a clean shot. '
'Win win. DACA forever dead'
"Holy Shit I was just thinking about this..  I wondered if I had missed some amazing news that it was solved and done because I haven't seen a peep about it from the left-wing crowd and *time is ticking*!\n\nSo what's this all about? They figured out that it doesn't get them votes and so they don't give a shit about the 'Dreamers' anymore?"
'Donald is giving them the jab-jab-uppercut nonstop right now.'
"Liberal judge has blocked the March 5th enforcement, so they've won for now anyway--nothing will happen to DACAs-- and can use it as a campaign issue for midterms.  Must go to Supremes for an overturn."
'I fucking love this. ‚ÄúHey you idiots! Remember when this was a life or death event not even two weeks ago? What happened?‚Äù'
"Lol he's trolling with class. Awesome!"
'He just exposed the Democrats as opportunists who pretend to care as long as it garners votes.\n\nThey really are disgusting people, and I‚Äôm glad the GEOTUS called them out on it!'
'Good let it expire and start those deportations '
"gd he's keeping it real lately hahaha"
'The Democrats just want Trump out. They could care less about DACA unless they can use it for their political purposes. '
'So if the date passes and we get Supreme Court to overturn they‚Äôd all immediately be going right?'
'They‚Äôre focused right now on milking the deaths of schoolchildren'
'Burrrrned. Gun control is way more interesting to them than DACA. Dems would probably deport everyone if it meant they had an opportunity to grab some guns. '
"Sweet innocent Kyle went from University student to full blown rioter. He grew up in a nice quaint town, his little life was so boring back then, that is until his new university buddies gave him a bandanna and a lighter then pointed him towards the nearest American flag.

"Y'all need to read Bishop Fulton Sheen's [A Plea for Intolerance](http://www.northamericanmartyrs.org/pdf/Plea-for-Intolerance.pdf)\n\nOver-abundant tolerance is practically a lack of love, since it seeks to affirm what is false and evil for the sake of comfort and complacency."

'This is perfect for Kek and for MAGA and for Trump. Let them keep this horseshit going. '
'Now its all trump supporters are nazis and its okay to punch nazis.'
'Not just that, it literally has "Love Trump" as the very beginning of the slogan. Scott Adams pointed that out at the time as well. It probably is *the* worst slogan of all time, given the magnitude of the event.'
'Yup.  And your mind  can see "Love Trump" as words\n\nAnd even if you focus on "Trump\'s Hate" you guarantee a symbiotic relationship with the man, and further.....perhaps even cause him to win so you can hate him.'
"Good luck outspending Soros. I wonder if they even bothered printed the copies he'll be paying for."
"Mods please sticky this until Wednesday, and if you already have it sending a copy to your least favorite Congress Critter's office sounds like fun!"
'Wonderful idea. '
'okay im in as well.'
'definitely sticky this\n'
"Jees, I bought one back in 2016 already.  May be I'll order hardcover copy this time.  \n\nSpez: Bought Audi-version instead. I hope it counts. And they've change the title, since 2016, so there must be some new stuff there."
"Do people actually read these political books, or is buying one just just a way to support the author? Truth be told, I bought Been Carson's book (way back before Trump was even running) but only read 1 chapter.  I also bought multiple books by Michael Savage but never finished reading them. Personally I buy them to show my support. "
"I will gladly do this. There should also be reminders on this site on the 12'th to get as many other pedes as possible to do it as well. "
'Mods please sticky.'
'They will be buying their own books like Scientology. '
'Setting my alert right now! '
"buy Eric Bolling's books while you're at it - he needs the $$ & support"

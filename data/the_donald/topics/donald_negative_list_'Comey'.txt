FUCK YEAH: COMEY UNDER INVESTIGATION... Former FBI director James Comey is under investigation for mishandling classified information, DOJ inspector general Michael Horowitz revealed Monday.
11 House Republicans are calling on Attorney General Sessions to prosecute (in no particular order):Hillary Clinton, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Sally Yates, Loretta Lynch, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page and Dana Boente
TRUMP: 'The big questions in Comey’s badly reviewed book aren’t answered like, how come he gave up Classified Information (jail), why did he lie to Congress (jail), why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn’t they TAKE it), why the phony memos, McCabe’s $700,000 & more?'
This man is going to Prison. Comey testified under oath on 1/6/17 that the dossier was salacious and unverified. Yet now we know he was using it from day 1 to apply for the FISA warrants.
'DOJ Inspector General Horowitz says that if he is found guilty, he shall receive the **maximum sentence** of a 10 hour training session on how to handle classified documents.'
"Tell me when he's behind bars, as inside of a federal prison cell.  Until then.. meh.."
'KEEP UP THE PRESSURE PEDES!\n\n Call your rep tell them we want the full unredacted unmodified OIG report!\n\nhttps://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative\n\n“And so,\xa0my\xa0fellow Americans:ask not what your country can do for you—ask\xa0what\xa0you can do\xa0for\xa0your country.”\n\n🇺🇸MAGA🇺🇸'
"He said they'd write a report on it. Probably another report where it shows obvious bias only to conclude there was no bias "
'That must be why that cuck was hiding in Iowa.  '
'Graham on fire'
'“I didn’t mishandle classified information. The reporter I leaked it to mishandled it.”'
'Soon, Comey will be mumbling something about intent while sound asleep in Leavenworth, cell block 8.'
'But did he intend to violate the law? '
'Of course he is, why do you guys think Sessions appointed Huber ?  Why do you guys think BIG MOUTH Comey stopped talking? They told him about a month or so ago he was a "TARGET"Badaaaaaa BING Mouth shut !!'
'Blatant disregard and deliberation = "mishandled" \n\nFederal Bureau of Matters.'
'But no reasonable prosecutor will bring charges.'
'Gonna need a big ass jumpsuit'
'Remember folks, \n\nNO EVIDENCE OF BIAS IN THE FBI'
'That treasonous piece of human excrement needs to be locked up for attempting to subvert democracy.'
'Has there ever been a time when there were more investigations with little to no prosecutions? '
'Why the fuck is it just 11 reps? It should be all of them...followed by a vote.'
'This is just a call for more investigations.  We have no shortage of investigations.  What we are lacking is handcuffs.'
'Let’s not forget that skanky Debbie Ramen Noodle Head that threatened the Capitol Police.  Edit: Wendy or Windy because she blows.'
'Pressure builds.  \n\nSlowly, slowly, catchee monkey'
"Let's see...we have Mueller investigating everything Trump at this point. No evidence of coluuuuusion. Yet $hillary and Co get off scott-free"
'IMPORTANT!!! Message AG Jeff Sessions in support of this! \nUse the contact form https://www.justice.gov/doj/webform/your-message-department-justice\n\nSelect “Messages to the Attorney General” in the message topics options and let your voice be heard!\n\nYou have to do this whether you think it will result in direct action or not. You have to register your opinion. Even if it only allows the AG to say they have heard from the American people and they are outraged, that is ammo they need.'
'Sessions is Sleepy and Rosenstein isn’t going to prosecute himself.'
'Mueller, Holder, and ALL poverty pimps....'
'No Obama?'
'So we only have 11 members of the house worth a shit? That’s the big question.'
'"Today I have instructed Jeff Sessions to prosecute, in no particular order: Crooked Clinton, Leakey Comey, McCabe, Cankles Lynch, Sallly Yates, the FBI Lovebird Agents, and Dana Boentes. First one singing gets a PARDON. Lets DEAL!"'
"I'm missing Obama on that list. The fact alone that he's a Kenyan who somehow made it to president should he enough to lock him up forever. "
'This letter is the most toothless piece of trash'
'Is this it or just more fangless congressional bitching? '
'Lol, watch Jeff Sessions ignore this plea.\n\nAt this point the senators and congressmen should just force Swampy Jeffy to resign.'
'Shit or get off the pot, Sessions!'
"Trumps staple is firing people who can't do they're job. It's only a matter of time. "
"Yeah, great, but WHEN ???\n\nLiberals are getting too damn comfortable.\n\nLet's get this fucking show on the road!!!"
'Professor Turley, "Comey harming FBI with his book." \n\nComey about Comey. Nothing more.'
'I can hardly wait for the judge to tell them that they have no "standing".'
'They won’t. Dems never get what they deserve. Shame on America. (I’m American)'
"Will see what happens...  But I won't be happy until I see a Jury of Trump supporters!"
'**"....untruthful slime ball who was, as time has proven, a terrible Director of the FBI. His handling of the Crooked Hillary Clinton case, and the events surrounding it, will go down as one of the worst “botch jobs” of history. It was my great honor to fire James Comey!"**\n\nHAHA!'
"Here's the thing: Comey *did* lie. He should be prosecuted. Why isn't he?"
'Damn he is pissed this morning!! Love it!'
'Comey, the softest and weakest 6’8” man in history. Has the spine of a crawfish.'
'Arrest him during his book tour!  Fucking do it already!'
'🔥 SUPA HOT FIRE 🔥'
'How can you not love this guy?! ❤🇺🇸🇺🇸\n\nMAGA 2020 🇺🇸'
'Those twatter replies tho....WEW...the stupid it hurts!'
"Spittin' fire in the AM!"
"Such a breath of fresh 'fly over country' air to see a President call out the bullshit AND fix it. "
'Seen desperate libtards dismiss this as having no basis in facts.'
'Savage af!'
'Do the one thing he hates the most boss...tell the truth about him...MAGA!!!'
'Comey is a pathetic excuse for a human being '
"This is why I can't go other places on the internet. There are no memes spicier than that of a centipede's. "
'What a fucking DORK'
"That's the fake Hillary."
'Dirty Cop (Comey)'
'Fuck yea'
'Paul Ryan looking at the EU flag and Hillary Crazy Peter Daou looking at Hillary lol.'
'Is it just me or has shit been kind of slow lately? \n\nNot much happening...'
'She looked really bad that day. All puffy and hung over. And it was not even that hot. '
"Just sad that Comey can't concentrate."
"Holy shit, Comey  \nGet over Crooked's body double already"
'# RICO CHARGES'
'The more it happens, the less mysterious these murders become. Excuse me, I meant *accidents/suicides*. '
'More said here than the fake media could ever report.'
'Is this the first time he has publicly accused Brennan and Clapper of leaking?'
'Shots fired.   Direct hit.  That’s a whole lot of truth on a Monday morning. '
'Name dropping without giving a f*ck. Straight spice from the shitposter in chief 🔥🔥🔥'
'#HOLY SHIT HE NAMED ALL THE LEAKERS'
'Foreshadowing \n\nThe arrests are coming\n\nAnd the targets have been named \n\nMust be stopped!'
'yea the final fight is starting'
'Holy shit the spice levels there. Already awake and shitposting kek.'
'I think Trump may be laying the groundwork for refusing to authorize Schiff’s memo!'
'If he is making these accusations, you KNOW he knows something!'
'My morning was going real shitty and then I saw this '
'**You little Schiff, stop leaking!**  '
'#Holy Schiff! The mad man said it!'
'I googled adam schiff and the man is completely devoid of any charisma. pathetic. '
'Out for an hour and still zero reply from anti trump subs. Anybody knows why?'
"Did ya'll notice how they are defending the FBI but not themselves, although they are just as corrupt. People have a tendency to remove themselves from situations they are guilty of."
'Days are definitely numbered now.  The curse is real. '
'Adam Shit BTFO'
'Fuck me...Page 5 original statement.  HRC meets all four criteria for bringing charges.'
'I want everyone to take notice of something very important here.\n\nEvidence.\n\nWhen we discuss politics and wrong doing by politicians, we actually have evidence. That is why we\'re suppressed, shadow banned, and why people on Reddit can\'t stand us. When you visit redacted, they post blogs about "alleged" wrongdoing by people with anonymous sources familiar with anonymous sources familiar with a certain person\'s thinking.\n\nEvidence. We have it. Others don\'t '
'Translation: Comey was going to charge her; someone stopped it. There are some big answers waiting to be found. Getting closer!'
'#EVERYONE IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS GUILTY. PERIOD.'
'Number 7 on r/all but it\'s not there when I log out. It\'s sooo ironic that these people act all high and mighty about net neutrality and how everything should be open and fair, yet here they are "throttling" a subreddit because it hurts their political agenda.'
'#HOLY SHIT'
'What has happened to our country?  Sad. 5th columns be damned.'
'so much evidence, so little prosecution '
"Those are not just changes made for readability, those are absolute alterations of their meaning and impact, as well as any resultant punishment or reprimand to be had. The entire message's impact and goal is changed. There is no question, none at all, why they did not want us to know about these."
'Comey and his legacy employees at the FBI are the definitive example of biased corruption. '
'Grossly negligent -> Extremely careless'
'Wait, obviously it\'s shady and corrupt af that Lynch and Obama made Comey change grossly negligent to "extremely careless", but does it even matter at this point? From the looks of it, Comey was going to let Clinton off regardless, even if he had left grossly negligent in the report...\n\nIt would be an entirely different story if the original report was also going to bring forward indictment charges, but that wasn\'t going to happen.'
"Remember When Comey had the surprise press conference without informing anyone else it the administration what he was going to say? This is evidence that a lot of changes were being made to his reports on the Clinton investigation that he didn't agree with. There had to be a lot of pressure being applied to him. I wonder if they have dirt on him or something?\nI'm glad he spoke out. But I still don't like the guy."
'Gross Negligence *An indifference to, and a blatant violation of, a legal duty with respect to the rights of others.*   \n\nLock her up!'
'#It is no longer Tick Tock..It is now Drip Drip Drip.'
'Can somebody go lock that bitch up?'
"I'm going to echo what another centipede said on a related thread last night: the vindication feels good, but it's bittersweet. I can't help but feel the undermining of trust in what are supposed to be pillars of blind justice (even if something good eventually comes of it), is sad and potentially dangerous for our country."
'Military tribunals across all tv channels live, or the day of the rope, your call traitors. One way or another, we will remove these criminals from power. '
'SPICY AS FUCK '
'You know what makes me believe in Russian bot farms?  Rampant Trump Derangment Syndrome.  "Mr. Doody-head Pee-tape" tweets are too stupid for college lefties or even 6th graders.  Besides, they\'re either in school right now or won\'t be awake for several more hours, or both.'

'STOP THE PRESSES!'

'Time for people to stick their hands down into the shit and get them dirty. Fire with Fire'
"Some get Comey and McCabe down to the border pronto! We'll have a wall in a week with all the bricks they're shitting right now."
"Holy crap. He's going to war!"
'Perjury is a felony.\n\n[18 USC § 1621](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1621) Jail time up to 5 years if convicted.\n\n>IF convicted'
'The Establishment has still not gotten over the fact that they lost in 2016! \n\nToo bad, the people have spoken and they voted proudly for Donald Trump!'
"JESUS MY LORD AND SAVIOR CHRIST YOU WEREN'T JOKING ABOUT THE LACK OF BRAKES ON THIS TRAIN PEDES!!"
'It does seem like McCabe really put his foot in it implicating his boss in lying to Congress.'
'Yet when you fire a man who lied under oath and who leaked classified material to the media in order to justify a special counsel to overthrow an election that is somehow "interfering" in an investigation. Even though that person has FULL AUTHORITY under the United States Constitution to fire than man. '
'CALLED THE FUCK OUT'
'mad man'
'Charge him with perjury and obstruction of justice.  Throw the damn book at him.'
'PERJURY!!! YES!!! BITCH COMEY!!!'
'LIED      .........       UNDER        ..........   OATH\n\nFROM THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE '
'A felony? That’s it?'
'Obliterate them, Don.'
'>why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn’t they TAKE it)\n\nImagine the tendies that would drop if Trump tweeted out five words:\n\n#HIS NAME WAS SETH RICH.'
'Remember when Trump fired Comey and Colberts entire audience clapped and celebrated... and then Colbert said "Whoa Whoa Whoa! You wouldn\'t want to be confused with Trump supporters would you?!'
'Or why is Comey allowed to write a book? You ain’t allowed to write a book after you leave the FBI for 10 years. And then he does it after getting fired. '
'Comey is a traitor who tried to blackmail the President with the fake dossier.'
'Lock Comey up for shitting on democracy in the name of his own brand. Dude is a narcissistic fucking swamp monster.'
"I don't want someone in charge of the FBI who goes on a book tour right after leaving, whether fired or retired. Makes me question their motivations and judgement."
'Saw these tweets. As soon as I read em I knew the media was going to frame it as\n "Trump is losing it. Trump is going crazy on twitter. Trump is becoming unhinged. This is the end for trump" lol first article I see, it\'s it\'s exactly that. These loony leftys are so predictable. '
'(Jail) holy fuck'
'Bottom line: Comey needs to be indicted, prosecuted, and sentenced.'
'The problem is that Sleepy Sessions is not Harvey Dent.\n\nHas Andy McCabe been indicted yet?'
'Comey is a Weasel.  Fuckery Bullshit Incoming. '
'And, as usual, *MAGICALLY* the first comments on the Twitter post are some libtard account trying to deflect the entire subject back to Trump in a desperate, long chain of comments and shilling...\n\n**REALLY MAKES YOU FUCKIN THINK**'
"Downvote brigade is energetic this morning.  What's the matter, kiddos?  Are you mad that your entire party from your favorite candidate all the way down to you, the useful idiot, are getting called out for the criminals, traitors and frauds that you are?\n\nAww."
"Comey should be prosecuted, but it's rumored he received full immunity from his buddy Robert Mueller. \n\nTrump and/or Jeff Sessions need to end Mueller's investigation ASAP and start prosecuting the real criminals like Comey, Lynch, the Clintons, DWS, and Obama."
'Comey should be executed for treason. Yeah, I said it. If you disagree,fuck you too. Covfefe!'
'Trump has no chill'
'A President who says the system is rigged WHILE in office, what timeline is this ??'
'Its kind of sad every time i click on one of these tweets the comments are always so toxic.'
'Comey must be arrested & convicted of obstruction of justice!'
"Oh my fuck, look at those tweets.  It's like everyone is fucking retarded."
'I think people overlook a huge issue, Comey fell on his sword for this country. He knew that an investigation could reveal this and all of the other lovely, dirty secrets.\n\nHow bad, corrupt are the Democrats and Republicans? What more will they find on Trump and Russia relationship? On Hillary and her emails?\n\nMy opinion is that she should be in jail, any other American would be.'
"I hate to hijack something, but am I the only one who has had to go and uptrump things I've already uptrumped?"
'We all thought 2018 was going to be crazy. Didn’t realise it was all gonna happen in the first 5 days!'
'Golly Gosh we have a problem '
'Remember guys, hillary Clintons matter was found to be extremely careless. However the investigation revealed she’s grossly negligent with a greater chance than not that foreign governments infiltrated her closet server. If you’re confused, so am I. '
"I can't wait to read about her arrest, i literally get jittery imagining it"
'SHIT JUST GOT FUCKING REAL FAM'
'Lol Edited out? In the press conference he said "she had classified emails on her server 5 of which were classified as \'Top Secret\'" thats a felony right there so what more could she have done?'
"This is the kind of hardcore red-pilling that might even drag Keith Olbermann out of his mom's basement again and have him start ranting and frothing even more."
"Why are Comey's SUBORDINATES making edits to his memo? I.e. the most important memo he has ever written? He was the HEAD of the FBI, was he not??\n\nMethinks one of his underlings had a direct line to the witch queen herself."
'Felonies and misdemeanors, oh my!'
"Has anyone bothered to ask how subordinates could just willy nilly change Comey's memo?  For those of you who report to a manager, do you regularly go in and alter their work and send it off?"
'Justice Boner Status: Impressive!\n\n(sorry, I don\'t normally post \'crude\' things like this, but I watched the video and was like "Damn! They\'re just calling out all this shit that we\'ve known for a long time!"'

'We all knew Comey was full of shit from day one.'
'Sayonara, Comey.  Per Comey\'s own testimony the dossier is "salacious and unverified" yet he certified the veracity of the dossier to the FISA court prior to testimony.  Perjury?  '
'Even worse for the FBI. \n\nEVERY CASE HE HAS EVER BEEN CALLED UPON AS A WITNESS CAN NOW COME INTO QUESTION. \n\nThink about that for a moment.  '
'He should be apprehended based on factual evidence of his false statements alone pending his trial.'
'I wonder if one day the name "James Comey" will become psynonemous with treacherous scumbag, sort of like Benedict Arnold.'
'Don’t drop the soap, Lurch'
'As I have said, the truly damning thing isnt that they used the dossier, its that they knew it was fabricated. They intentionally lied to the FISC. '
'Arrogant, lying shithead.'

By preemptively releasing a story like this with no sources anyone who publicly calls to curtail the Mueller investigation in response to the recent revelations will be tarred and feathered by the leftist press for shilling for the president. It’s a low effort, high reward yellow journalism media strategy.'

'This is what annoys me about Trump, dude you are the DOJ!  \nForce an investigation.'
"If he doesn't know by now Sessions is there to cover up the swamp and get Trump impeached..\n\nWhy is the president complaining about his employee? Trump should declassify everything related to the Clintons and Obama, and let the nuclear FOIA's fly. Then declassify everything else. He's not the one with anything to hide."
"Yeah Sessions, where the fuck is the DOJ?  It's about time you rescind your recusal and do the job the President chose you to do."

"You have to imagine Trump is in communication with the DOJ and knows exactly what they're up to, yet for months nothing has come from Trump calling out Sessions over the lack of action DOJ. If Sessions would come out and just give a few bread crumbs in the direction he's going it would go a long way."
'If Comey, Clinton, and yes Obama are shown that they can get away with their crimes then why should any gang-banger be behind bars.  This only goes to intensify the Leftists argument against the judicial system.  No one should be above the law and if this lawlessness is permitted then how can anyone have any respect for the law.

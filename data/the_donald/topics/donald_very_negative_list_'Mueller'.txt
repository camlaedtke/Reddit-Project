"Yes, Trump is an American hero, and those who would deny this are just lying to themselves, because their little sjw brains can't get over the fact that he says things as he sees them rather than sugarcoating everything. President Trump finally freed us from the evil lying Paris agreement that was created to decieve us and make us slow down our economy so that the damn french and their shitty nuclear energy can catch up!"

'First Weinstein, a powerful long-time friend of Hillary Clinton, is brought up on sexual assault charges, then Hillary gets publicly criticized by left-leaning outlets for not speaking out against him and now the brother of her campaign manager is being investigated. This might be a sign that Hillary Clinton has completely lost her political influence. '
"Translation: We aint found shit. Now we're going to poison the well, and make any ACTUAL investigation into ACTUAL injustice more difficult by using misinformation to muddy the waters."
':0 What the fuck is this timeline? Will anything come out of this? Is Mueller really /ourguy/?'
'Mueller will find all kinds of very very naughty vague things, but no intent.  So no prosecutor would move forward with the case.\n'
'We investigated ourselves and found there was no wrong doing.'
'Fuck this shit.  Trying to throw us crumbs to save your job?   Fuck your "leakers".   Fuck your "impartiality".   Mueller needs to resign.    '
" People who got wrapped up in pedogate need to see the big picture here.   This always has been about Hillary and the uranium connection to Russia. No one is denying pedogate is real, but it is a hard sell to the American people. in general we are more conditioned to accept corruption regarding our politicians rather than complete and total child rape.\n\nConsider the case of Al Capone. they rightly threw everything they could think of at him and yet nothing would stick.\n\n So how did they get him? Tax evasion. that was something they could get him on and by getting him out of the picture it led to the destruction of mob rule as we know it.   Capone was guilty of far more serious crimes But it was him being jailed for tax evasion which brought down his Empire..\n\n Trump is definitely rounding up pedophiles at a record pace. But the kingpins will be brought down by other means and the sex trafficking destroyed simply by destroying the infrastructure which allows it to happen.\n\n we will never get the satisfaction of seeing them tried for child rape.  However, the point isn't our satisfaction. the point isn't to sate our blood thirst for justice.\n\n the point is to eliminate the demand by jailing them on whatever we can.  and using them to turn on each other for plea deals and work your way up.\n\n and because of the delicate nature of these types of Investigations,  we cannot and should not be told what is happening every step of the way is that is no different than broadcasting our strategies to terrorists overseas like Obama would do -  What is the point of telling the general populace what you will do before you do it, only to have the people you're going after know as well?\n\n This is going to be a very long and protracted process. Uranium one is going to be the Waterloo of Hillary, Bill, Obama, and many others. but don't expect convictions right away. Instead expect news of this to build and snowball with potential arrests coming just prior to the 2018 elections, right when it will hurt the establishment the most.\n\n electoral extermination of the establishment is the number one most effective way to remove those who engage in these heinous acts From having the political power finances and access to continue to do so.\n\n it might not be as satisfying as all of us getting our torches and pitchforks and stringing up people, but it is the most effective way to prevent future Problems. Once safely removed from harm and adequate protections are put in place for the victims, you will see them start to come forward.  but not until after the uranium one convictions."
'Hey, remember the Weinstein company, run by those two old corrupt abusive brothers, until one of them turned against the other one?'
"Mueller 'investigating' these known scandals and claiming there is no evidence of wrongdoing is the easiest way to put them to bed in the eyes of lefty voters. How he manages to not be investigating himself is another scam altogether."

"Rod Rosenstein needs to be put under oath to answer some questions.\n\nRod Rosenstein: \n\nSigned FISA application(s) extending surveillance on Trump team because muh Russia.\n\nWrote a memo to AG Sessions and President Trump outlining why Comey should be fired as FBI Director two weeks after being confirmed as Deputy AG. \n\nAppointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller. \n\n***Why did he want a Special Counsel in the first place?***\n\nTo look into Russia? There were already active FBI investigations looking into that *with a FISA warrant.* What could Mueller find that the *FISA warrant* couldn't? So was it to investigate whether the firing of Comey obstructed this investigation? He recommended Comey's firing! And Comey himself testified that his firing would not and could not impede the Russia investigation. \n\nThere is only one answer: the FISA warrant expired and could no longer be renewed, so they needed another way to continue digging dirt on the Trump team. And they still have nothing after a year. A couple perjury trap indictments. That's it. Why is the Mueller investigation still going on, and why did it start in the first place? Put Rod Rosenstein in the hot seat. Now."
"Go to the mueller.....those idiots still think Trump colluded .  At this point no amount of fact or evidence is going to change their retarded minds. It's kind of sad lol. "
'Mueller should go ahead and resign.  He was handed a rubber sword and thrown into battle.  At some point he has to realize that this memo gives him a face-saving way out. '
"I guess I'm just a black and white deplorable, but how the hell is obtaining a FISA warrant using a dossier which YOU KNOW is false, NOT the same as LYING?!\n\nSorry, I fail to see the distinction or gray area here. They used a memo which they knew was garbage. "
'Holy shit, Katrina Pierson  and David Webb say during a meeting between HIC (including Nunes) and Rosenstein last month, Rosenstein threatened the Congressional members with a subpoena of their email and text messages because they were pressing for more documents. '

Yet, not a peep this graceful victory is bullshit and nowhere near as rewarding as I hopped for the years of frustration, know all this memo shit already.\n\nWe should be in the fucking streets to overthrow the intelligentsia that is STILL attempting to overtake out POTUS.'
'How can i take it to the bank? I died of gun violence last year. 😢'
'I am stunned.  I have sat and read that memo all the way through, and it\'s now very clear to me where the problem is.  The FBI and DOJ have abused FISA and the FISC for the purpose of defaming and destroying President Trump, and Clinton & the DNC pretty much paid for it.  I smell heads rolling for this, and the axeman is the one in office.  Mueller\'s "investigation" is now tainted AF and dead in the water.   '

It didn’t involve him in ANY real way, but he told Manafort he wasn’t aware of it.  And who knows how the question was asked.  Perjury trap,  Lock a UK citizen up who’s wife Is pregnant and charged with a felony. Stone is in trouble for joking he “dined with Assange” in an email. He absolutely did not. He was being Flamboyant Stone and it was probably about those DMs which is hardly dining. Manafort might be the one real scum here and he’s tied to Podesta. He’s facing 305 years.  Mueller may very well make that man live out his remaining years in a high security fed prison.  Thats a death sentence.  The only way out Is when ya keel over. \n\nAND, Mueller totally fucked Manafort today because he was led to believe based on known information, his money concerns were Ukrainian and nothing with Russia so it should be dropped. Mueller waited until the very last second and said “oops forgot.  Rod Rosenstein told me last August I could.” \n\nNo his defense has just wasted value time to prepare a defense. \n\nI bet technically Trump isn’t a target.. He’s just a “person of interest” but the minute he leaves that grand jury...”Ok, now you are”\n\nThis is SWAMPY!!  It’s fuckery. '
"Honestly this means nothing, this is exactly what I would do to get Trump to drop his guard. I don't believe for a second Mueller doesn't have a stronger force then gravity on his shoulders to find something on Trump. If he gets a chance to come after Trump he will wait until maximum impact to announce it. I wouldn't be surprised if this investigation drags out close to the next election and right before then Mueller will announce Trump as a possible criminal suspect whether Mueller had dirt or not just to have maximum impact.

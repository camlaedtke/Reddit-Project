Obama knew Russia was engaged in bribery ($500,000 to Bill Clinton), kickbacks ($145 million to the Clinton Foundation) and extortion in order to gain control of US atomic resources — yet still OK’d the 2010 deal to give Moscow control of 20% of America’s uranium. FBI Director at the time: Mueller.
Justice Department reopens Hillary Clinton email investigation!!!
@realDonaldTrump: Wow, looks like James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton long before the investigation was over...and so much more. A rigged system!
Pres. Trump: “You had Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party try to hide the fact that they gave money to GPS Fusion to create a Dossier which was used by their allies in the Obama Administration to convince a Court misleadingly, by all accounts, to spy on the Trump Team.” Tom Fitton, JW
'Wow, FBI confirms report that James Comey drafted letter exonerating Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete. Many people not interviewed, including Clinton herself. Comey stated under oath that he didn't do this-obviously a fix? Where is Justice Dept?'
'OP, we need to know right now. Please confirm for us that you are in your right mind, and that you are not suicidal. We need it on the public record, just in case. '
'This was beautiful! Huma hid like a little kid, and killary is a fucking liar.'
'LMAO "What happened to your health, Hillary?"  And then she gets Huma on her way out.  So good.'
'And that my fellow pedes is what a hero sounds like'
"Her face couldn't hide how triggered she was. Outstanding work!"
'"Well it\'s great for you to be here." \n\nKillary can\'t even pretend to care at her own book signing. How did she ever think she could be president?'
'It\'s great for you to be here??  Wtf kind of greeting is that. She must of meant "great for you to meet me"'
'Small detail but notice how she didn\'t reply "nice to see you too". Instead she said "its great for you to be here". Can guarantee those words were chosen specifically. She doesn\'t care about anyone but herself'
'Should have led with the Seth Rich question. Still top kek 👍🏻'
'ahaha beautiful! good job!!'
'ROFL oh wow and she even asked Huma when she is going to divorce Weiner lmao this is just too good.  This woman could be a journalist lol, she asks the questions we really want answers to!'

"The people who tore down the confederate statue and the people who support doing that illegally are not the people who'd give a fuck about y'all sledgehammering Bill Clinton's statue. I'm a leftist (not here to debate communism/anarchism/antifa whatever). I doubt anyone on our side would care if someone did this, or if ya'll did this. \n\nThe liberals on the left just care about doing stuff that's illegal. So they'd care, just like they care about the confederate statue being torn down illegally. \n\nGo for it. Sledgehammer him. It'll be hilarious. "
"As much as I would love to smash it I don't want to stoop the level of the left."

"I'm through the roof with excitement. Trump sending Crooked to jail will make this the best holiday season ever!\n\nLOCK HER UP!"
'I have 2 totally opposing trains of thought on this, someone help me out.  Either;\n\n1.  Media like WAPO and CNN are throwing these guys under the bus as an effort to maintain legitimacy. It’s a small window, they know they’re sinking ships, and they have an opportunity now to say “these people were our sources. They held positions of trust... they misled us and the American people who trust is for news...” If they ever wanted to do that, they haven’t really had a free opportunity until now. \n\nOR\n\n2 it’s a trap. Something else is looming that is negative for Trump, or vindicates these people. They report this, suck us in, and turn around and go “see, we reported negative on both sides. You can’t choose we are accurate only when you want to.” \n\nThoughts? '

"Well, aint that just the shit! Clinton's buddy that owns the plane, Ron Burkle, invested $800 million in Relativity Media. Guess who has worked with Relativity several times? Brett Ratner. Man, the connections to this are huge. One of Ron Burkle's buddies, Richard “Mad Dog” Beckman, has connections to Vogue, Teen Vogue, and GQ's Men of the Year. This all STINKS!!! \n\nSPEZ: The name of the group with Beckman was called Three Lions Entertainment. Also, the third guy is Joel Katz who was ranked Billboard magazine's number-one entertainment attorney. Katz also repped Michael Jackson's estate in a deal with BMI for rights to his public performances and handles Nashville-based record label Big Machine, where Taylor Swift is signed."

'I want to believe this, but we must be rigorous about the quality of all news, even news that says things we want to hear.

Following the link to that article and reading it briefly, that article is fake news ("sources familiar with his thinking").  Many of the points made in the article are not sourced, but I am familiar with the source of most of what is being stated, so I\'m ok with it.  As stated, these items are easily looked up, too.  The last paragraph is conjecture about what will happen, no sourcing.  That,while pleasing to me to hear, is not news, just the author\'s speculation.\n\nTldr: Premise is a faulty source.

He figures the American public deserves to know what’s going on behind the scenes even if it costs him his life.  This guy, I love him more everyday for what he is willing to sacrifice.

"My heart is fluttering with excitement and absolute love for our President, you guys. I didn't think I could end up loving him as much as I do now, but every day he proves to me and to all of us that he is the golden man that will save us all from the macabre evil that has been drowning our country. He is our messiah, our savior, and I pray for his safety and his family and loyal administration's safety every single day. "
"I've said it since the day he said he wasn't going to go after Hillary because she's been through so much: he was definitely going after her and was just Trumping the fuck out his quad aces. It's just like when he talks about how great someone is before he fires them. Trump is the type of guy who gets nicer the more he is going to eat your lunch. "
'I think this was he was referring to with the "calm before the storm" statement. \nI bet these will clearly show the bribes they took, the wiretaps and unmasking they did and  also they colluded with both Russia the British spy. '

This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. ...In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses.

Not talking about the largest shooting in American history that 78% of Americans believe is untrue. The fact that they’re not talking about the possible collusion of the former president Obama the divider w Russia also, not talking about JFK  something every other president has put off for 50+ years!!! Weinstein has now taken a backseat also, allegations of rampant pedophilia in Hollywood and as most of the educated TD subs know is in DC too but, NOOO they are talking about DJT having women saying he touched them inappropriately which was debunked last year!!! They can’t handle that their fake narrative is falling apart and that America is WINNING again just like Mr.President said last year!

'The comments are just anti-Trump. There\'s only one that I saw that was about HRC, and the rest went into tangents about nothing. \n\nThere doing a terrible job at censorship too, because Eagle Pundit agreed with Trump, and he was pretty high up in the comments. \n\n\nThe best part, and I really laughed out loud, was Donald Trump\'s response to Ed Krassenstein. The sheer sarcasm was so good.\n\nEdit: Nevermind. I didn\'t see that "Donald\'s" tweet was a parody.'

'Giuliani also at the end says "Thank you George, you\'re always fair."\n\nWhy are Republicans like this? We ALL KNOW George isn\'t fair. He doesn\'t treat both sides fairly. He\'s different talking to Republicans, and completely different talking to the lawyers. Why does Giuliani not talk sense into George? Ask George, just once, if he\'s dense and doesn\'t know what perjury traps are? Why did George pretend he doesn\'t know what they? 10 minutes straight pretending perjury traps are something out of this universe.\n\nI don\'t understand why Republicans always go on the defensive like this. Who was Giuliani talking to here if not trying to reason with George, his progressive viewers?'
'Yeah, everybody wants that! Golden ticket to do what you want. \nI want to buy the DNC so I lock the nomination before the primaries! \nHey, no problem.

I know what is best for these people so it will be great when I’m the most powerful person in the free world.\nAfter all, after I negotiated my position of Secretary of State, I could prove myself, and all it cost me was to put my peeps and money behind Obama.\nGreat choice and I am a genius. I can keep what I do secret just by having my own server! A small inexpensive piece of machinery and I control it completely. Delicious.\nI have a charity, because I am such a charitable person and I run that charity for which I must be paid a lot because it is work. My friends have to be paid to and the fact that they work for the government is fine! How in the world would there be a conflict of interest?? In fact, my top aide had 3 jobs she gets paid for. What a go-getter she is.\nWe don’t think about pesky things like conflict of interest. We are only interested in power and money, so as long as there is no conflict in that, it’s all good.\nBesides, my good friend Sid tells me what’s what and I trust him so I’m a great Secretary of State. \nI’ll be a better President because I deserve it, have worked for it all my life, and have done everything in my considerable power to make that happen. \nOh, the things I will do....\n'
"Rudy's just gaining steam...I love it!"
'Wow. Hadn’t gotten a chance to watch this but the way reddit front page posts made it seem Giuliani sputtered and lied through the interview making no sense. In reality he gave very reasonable answers and was friendly despite the absolutely ridiculous questions that George kept asking like whether he was confident of some situation he could have no way of knowing about. '
'"George, you\'re always fair" at the end there was a good one.'
'Rush Limbaugh literally said something like this about a week ago.  Like under what circumstances would he want Trump to be interviewed by Mueller.\n\nI expect Rush to talk about this on Monday.'
"Couldn't even stop his own laugh. They know it is true."
"He's old now, but he's smart. He was a prosecutor, mayor, etc. \nNewt has quirks too. He defended RyanCare and McConnellCare. \n\nI don't know if Rudy knows about the Huma Abedin laptop stuff. He might not want to talk about it unless authorized. His job is to deal with Mueller. His best leverage is Mueller's own shady past and whether that becomes widely known."
'Trump and his team do seem to incorporate advice from Rush and from Mark Levin regularly. This is great because the two of them have unparalleled knowledge of the Left and their tactics; Rush is an expert on the cultural side while Mark knows the legal side. See also Mark’s discovery of the Justice Department legal opinions stating a sitting President CANNOT be indicted.'

' Love this man!!!! '
'God I love him'
'Wow the comments on this tweet are pretty based too! '
'"Rigged system, or just a double standard?"\n\nA great example of the presumptive close. Both options are bad and push the reader to reach the conclusion Trump wants which is that the system sucks and needs fixing. \n\nSort of like when a salesman doesn\'t ask "Do you want the car" but instead asks "Would you like the car in blue or do you prefer red?"\n\nTrump is very, very experienced in big ticket, high stakes (like casinos and golf courses) sales and is bringing this to political tweeting!\n'
'Love my President.'
'Folks who have been criticizing Sessions for not doing anything are unaware the he has been completely restructuring and transforming the DOJ so when the time is nigh to bring the Obama/Clinton conspirators to justice the DOJ will function like a well oiled precision machine. Trump has been greatly assisting this effort by quietly filling vacancies in the Federal court systems with young deeply conservative judges. The recent judgement against Leandra English and her claim to head the CFPB by a Trump placed district judge is a prime example of the benefits of them preparing the system to work in their favor. The foundation of justice has to be solid for justice to be served. Time is on Trump and Sessions side and they are going to make sure they do it right.'
"Don't forgot Comey wrote letter absolving her before interview even took case.  Proof positive if this was a case - which it should be.  \n.  \nIt's a myth that only government prosecutors are suppose to bring charges forward in the modern - corrupted - legal system.  If the charges are against government officials, this completely fails.  Under the original (and real) American system, anyone could bring charges before a grand jury - this is called private prosecution, or the grand jury itself could investigate without a government ok.  The grand jury is tasked with investigating any criminal conduct it has knowledge of, not if they get permission from the government.  In this aspect, the grand jury is suppose to have more power then an appointed prosecutor."

"It's been known, among a lot of people my age who like history, that England passed the torch of the pay for play scheme along after WWII. The reason behind WW1 was England not allowing Germany or Russia to enter the world theater by expanding their economy or influence. The Democrats have continued to only allow Russia to participate IF they take their back alley deals, thus the sanctions. Russia made a power play and the DNC hammered them to keep Russia from making any move they don't approve of. \n\nThe result is Russia only knowing one way to deal with the US. Either by meddling in the Middle East and causing headaches for us or by crooked politics. Not saying they are innocent and we are all to blame but Clinton's involvement with Russia is hardly a surprise. "
"DOJ:  Madame Clinton may we see your deleted emails?\n\nHELLSPAWN:  I don't recall.  Fuck off.\n\nDOJ:  Sorry to bother you please forgive.\n\nHELLSPAWN:  more Chardonnay, fatso.\n\nDOJ:  Yes ma'am."
"On the other hand, President Trump definitely needs to fire Mueller immediately. If his hireling Clintonites and Obamaites don't scream out bias, I don't know what does."
'Exactly. Email is a two way street and unsecured both ways (for the most part). One person can delete the email all day long, but the other sender(s)/recipient(s) may not have or may actually be working legally and messages are properly archived and accessible. This is basic stuff, and the fact that it is only now coming up is pretty telling in and of itself.'
'At least five foreign governments supposedly hacked her illegal server. Just because it was so easy to do.  Russia is one of them, allegedly.  Hillary, et al., don\'t dare gripe or mention those hacked classified emails, or that any other countries stole them. Interesting isn\'t it?  Classified government emails were hacked vs. Podesta/DNC emails, and they have been having this gigantic meltdown and Russia collusion investigation about the DNC emails????  And the DNC Is NOT EVEN A GOVERNMENT ENTITY!!!!   AND Russia didn\'t even hack those, Seth Rich leaked them!!!   Somebody should come forward with the truth.  Somebody knows.  I think the FBI knows and isn\'t being truthful.  I believe they are saved on Anthony Weiner\'s laptop, marked "life insurance".  Why does the FBI know the answers to everything already, yet they are having this pointless investigation and they are withholding THE TRUTH -- that 2/3rds of our government is corrupt, that Hillaey and the last Administration committed treason -- from all of us.  If the Left took over, those in the FBI that know the truth will go down too, with the rest of us. There is no excuse for not helping POTUS.  It would not even be changing the natural course of things, the Left and deep state are doing that!!!!'
"Yeah. Democrat judge. This is a joke. Let's not think for five minutes that John Kerry didn't clean the server of all and any email that contained Benghazi. This is for show. The judge is paid to Bring this up to give the democrats a win. And what better way than no emails about Benghazi. "
"Guys, I don't think she's going to win the election.\n\nThe more important thing here is the precedence that is being set.  Two weeks from now, this ruling could be used to extend the search of someone else's emails..."

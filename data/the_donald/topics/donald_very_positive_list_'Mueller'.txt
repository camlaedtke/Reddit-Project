Obama knew Russia was engaged in bribery ($500,000 to Bill Clinton), kickbacks ($145 million to the Clinton Foundation) and extortion in order to gain control of US atomic resources — yet still OK’d the 2010 deal to give Moscow control of 20% of America’s uranium. FBI Director at the time: Mueller.
American Hero. The_Mueller is trying to make Mueller the first image result for "American Hero", but we here at T_D know who the real hero is.
'Mueller is a hero! He, with the taxpayers money, did his civic duty and filled in for the IRS uncovering money crimes from 11 years ago! Thank god there’s a patriot like Mueller in charge of the investigation...\n\nWhat a hack. Taking his investigation on the biggest reach in the history of the word reach. Once he retires someone should send him a plaque for his office...”Gone Fishin”'

'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Rosenstein\n\n**President Donald Trump nominated Rosenstein to serve as Deputy Attorney General for the United States Department of Justice on January 13, 2017**. Rosenstein was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on April 25, 2017. In May 2017, he authored a memo which President Trump said was the basis of his decision to dismiss FBI Director James Comey.[3]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mueller#2017_appointment_as_special_counsel\n\n**On May 17, 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller to serve as special counsel for the United States Department of Justice**. In this capacity, Mueller oversees the investigation into "any links and/or coordination between Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump, **and any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation"**.[38]'

"The DNC rigs the Democratic Primary Election against Bernie Sanders so Hilliary can win the nomination. Obama's administration starts to request surveillance on Trump, his family, his transition team, and anyone associated with him. Donna Brazil gives Hilliary the questions to a debate. The DNC pays Christopher Steele to come up with a smear dossier about Trump. The mainstream media releases a taped conversation about Trump talking about grabbing women parts. After all this Trump still wins the General Election. \n\nObama orders an investigation into Russia meddling in our elections. Obama changes Executive Order 12333 to allow more agencies to have access to surveillance data. The Democratic Party comes up with a scandal that Trump Colluded with Russia to win the election with no evidence or proof. This wild claim is backed up by the mainstream media. \n\nObama hold overs start unmasking Trump's transition team and staff members then release the classified information to the mainstream media. Why? Because the DNC and the Obama administration colluded with the intelligence community to thwart Trump's campaign efforts to get him elected president. All this Russia collusion is an attempt to cover up the fact that the Obama administration, the intelligence community, the DNC, along with the mainstream media used our nations surveillance as a political tool to try to get Hilliary elected President. This makes Watergate look like a kindergarten play. Let that sink in.\n\nThis is plainly treason. Americans subverted by their own banana republic government that decides who will take rule, DOJ/Obama/FBI implicated directly. The government proven to subvert all US citizens in an act of treason."
"OP, I just wanted to say that this is remarkable. The writing style, the detail and research, the clear narrative throughout, the activated almonds reference, the list goes on. I'm amazed at the talent of some of the people in here. Really wanted to take a minute to thank you! "
'The MSM is branding it the “Disputed Republican Memo.”\n\nShould be branded “Bipartisan house committee memo.” Since the house intelligence committee released it, and that committee has members from both parties on it. We can play that fuckin name game too.'
"Pray for our President, 'pedes. Can you imagine what its like to be Trump, knowing all of this happened to you and your family? No one else could have had the backbone to stand against such a powerful storm. The cards were stacked against Trump, heavily. Yet, he powered through and works to Make America Great Again with such ferocity. Look at what he has accomplished in his first year while being shaken down by everyone around him. As centipedes, we must always strive to make damn sure that our wonderful POTUS knows **WE HAVE HIS BACK!**\n\n##**THANK GOD FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP!**"
'I have to play devil\'s advocate here!  First off thank you, well written and laid out and sourced!  But the memo ONLY talks about Carter Page.  If there were other Trump Associates then why not include that the Dossier was used for them too?\n\nConsidering Carter Page left the Trump team in Sept 2016 ... and the FISA was issued Oct 2016 if it truly limits the scope to Page then your fruit of the poison tree theory doesn\'t stand up.  \n\nOn the other hand, if there was a way that Mueller used the Carter Page FISA to retroactively unmask conversations between Page and other team Trump people AND he used that technique in his investigation then you are right.  However I think we should hold off on that assumption until we know if that is even possible or if there were other FISA warrants that Mueller had.\n\nThe obvious Democrat rebuttal to all this is going to be that Carter Page had a counterintel investigation in 2013 and so they could have used information from that to justify the FISA in Oct 2016.  However McCabe quote that "no FISA would have been issued without the Dossier" is fatal to that argument... but only to the 4th (and last) renewal.  I think thats the only one McCabe was privy to?\n\nBack to your point though, I don\'t know what all the FISA grants the intel community:  \n\n* Could they pivot off it and listen/unmask people connected to Carter Page? \n\n * If so, did Carter Page have to engaged with that person directly, or is association good enough (which would open it to the entire Trump campaign team)\n \n* Does the FBI and Mueller\'s team have the technical capability of retroactively pulling Carter Page communications before the FISA issue in Oct 2016?\n\n* And the **million dollar question**.... was the Carter Page FISA used as justification for other data source collections in the Mueller investigation.

Wray, you are free to go before the Special Counsel is appointed. The IG is running your agency right now anyway. \nAnd wait until that report drops. Wow."
"I honestly wouldn't be surprised if this was intentional on Obama's part. In the event that they succeeded, they trashed Trump, in the event that they were caught, they severely damage the reputation of the FBI. Either of those things are good in Obama's book, as his 8 years were spent attempting to destabilize the Republic to the best of his ability. Could this be 4D chess on his end?"
"Guys, I've gone through all 10,000 texts. Trust me, whatever those drumpf supporters think this is, this is all a giant nothing burger. Speaking of burgers, anyone want to buy my cheese?"
'I think it is 100% certain now nothing will come from the investigation. Imagine if they indict someone and pleads not guilty and requests a jury trial. \n\nIt would become a fucking circus. Mueller would have to testify under oath about these and just the very existence of these texts. Not to mention that now that Stozek has been confirmed as the person who interviewed Clinton, Mills and Abedin, but no records were kept, Clinton and her aides would probably testify under oath regarding that interview. \n\nI suspect Flynn may want to withdraw his plea. Any attorney worth their salt would love to buttfuck Mueller in a courtroom and this is a perfect chance. '
'Well well well well well!'
'Yeah, but the DOJ is only going through them to make sure they\'re "okay" to hand over to the House Intelligence Committee, who, as we all know, will do nothing about it.\n\nNot sure how I feel about these alphabet agencies taking months to "review" documents before they release them, either. I\'d bet the farm that we have never had an honest, unaltered document release from any of them.'
'https://www.mikehuckabee.com/index.cfm?p=latest-news&id=749AE770-8F4F-4D95-89B9-606D7634A68C\nexcerpt:\nThis looks too good to be true, but the website looks legit.\n\n-First, let me say I am very highly motivated, and, indeed, am literally salivating at the prospect of going after Trump, as I strongly supported Hillary Clinton for President –- having given over $16,000 to Democrats since 2008 –- and know she simply couldn’t have lost fairly because literally everyone in my circle of friends at the FBI voted for her.\n\n-You and I must know a lot of the same people. For example, I’m sure you’re acquainted with Ben Rhodes, who was Obama’s deputy national security advisor but who actually spent most of his time as a skilled political operative, constructing Obama’s “narrative.” Until very recently, I was literally Ben’s personal attorney, so of course I learned a lot from him about writing fiction, which will be useful to our legal team as we create our own narrative for what Trump did. (For example, it’s easy to leak to the media that evidence is piling up by the day, even when no evidence whatsoever has been found.) In fact, when the House Intelligence Committee was investigating possible Russian interference, I was literally Ben’s liaison with them. So I know what I’m doing –- literally –- and am, above all, political. Ben’s letter of recommendation is attached. I have also attached letters from my respected colleagues at the FBI, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page (who say hi), and also from Andrew Weissmann. They know I have what it takes to get the job done!\n\nI hope to join your investigative team as soon as possible and get to work unseating Donald Trump.\n\nThank you for your consideration,\n\nJeannie Rhee'

Imo.    Luckily, our POTUS is smarter than that. "
'>* ***The special counsel*** told President Trump\'s lawyers that he is a subject of the investigation into Russian interference into the 2016 election, but he is not a criminal target at this point, The Washington Post reported.\n>* The newspaper cited ***legal experts*** that said Trump could still become a target, however.\n\nLegal experts.\n\nAka "Anonymous sources familiar with the way investigations proceed so they have an opinion but that\'s it."

'The idea was never to indict trump. He can\'t. Only Congress can remove a president. \n\nThe idea was to use Mueller and the selective leaks to the media was to 1. Distract trump and force him to focus on this instead of his agenda. And 2. To bring down his approval numbers and set up impeachment should the "blue wave" happen. \n\nNeither of those things have panned out and Mueller is on the ropes to produce something. Anything. \n\nIf they can\'t bring Trump\'s approval down, they\'ll never be able to impeach him. If they can\'t Distract trump from his agenda, Trump succeeds. '

'> cannot indict a sitting president is laid out in a 1999 Justice Department memo\n\nyeah we don\'t need no stinking memo. He won\'t indict because he cannot. Firing Comey is a basic power of the presidency, enshrined in the constitution.  It requires no reason and no explanation. The idea that somehow obstruction of justice charges could be brought over that is looney tunes, yet a hundred "experts" spent the past year saying exactly that on TV every night.  Same goes for every other obstruction of justice fantasy they have, like a press release or tweets or talking about pardons or saying "Flynn is a good guy". shit like that would be laughed out of court for anyone, let alone a sitting president'

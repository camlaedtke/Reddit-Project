üö®üö®BREAKING! Mueller: Trump is NOT a criminal Target at this point.
"It's gonna be funny watching the left have a complete meltdown and start calling Mueller a white supremacist once he announces that no more indictments will be handed out."
'Can you imagine the looks on their faces when Podesta is indicted and it leads to a Hillary trial. \n\nShit is going to be amazing. '
'Like all lib astroturf subs, they will fail quickly due to a lack of natural energy and super-male vitality. '
'[They even have to alter their stats just to appear popular. ü§£](http://i.magaimg.net/img/1qf6.png)'
"I have a feeling the left's support of Mueller is going to backfire on them, bigly. "
'American Hero'
'oh wow that\'s a real thing and they unironically use "Drumpf". Once again the Left demonstrates they have no humor or creativity because those things are banned on their side  '
'American hero, President Donald J. Trump!'
"Someone on one of their threads is posting a timeline of Trump's involvement with Russia and it's all based on the ...dossier...that's been pretty much proven fake lol"
'American Hero '
'##American hero'
"Can't really out upvote the bots and reddit algorithm!\n\nAnother tiny anti-Trump sub that has posts in /all and tens of thousands more votes than actual popular reddit posts."
'I got banned from there pretty quick. Was trolling hard lol'
"The Mueller is just like all the rest.  A bunch of smelly, minimally employed ne'er do wells."
'Mueller American hero for what? '
'Potus Donald Trump is an American Hero. '
'Mueller is a swamp-dwelling vermin installed as a front end for Deep State. I guess Satan is a hero to the liberals, too, eh?'
'American hero'
'Might as well just rename themselves The_Pedo. Deepstate goon like that is always ballsdeep in some 10 yr old every other night.'
'That subreddit is almost flattering to the Donald '
"By the_Mueller's logic Robin is the hero and Batman is a villain."
'AMERICAN HERO'
"HA! They're energy can't dream of matching ours!"
"You shouldn't worry about what they do, the Mueller is just the newest way for the left to entertain themselves and to try to get a win, but it's not going to happen."
'Mueller is trying to save his skin. The writing is on the wall though since the U1 docs got dropped.'
'Mueller is the clean up man.  He\'s "investigating" so that he can get legal access to all the files and scrub them.  This is a sham.'
'I feel like this probe is going everywhere with no results. Though this looks like it may blow back on Hillary and the Dems!'
'Don‚Äôt fall for this shit. \n\nThese investigation leaks have been 50/50 true/false. \n\nSecondly this is a transparent attempt to keep Mueller around. Don‚Äôt go for it. \n\n**This serves a dual purpose of taking the heat off Mueller currently, as well as giving Poedesta a free pass later on. ‚ÄúSee, they ‚Äòinvestigated‚Äô us and found nothing wrong!!!‚Äù.**'
'Almost certainly not true.  A distraction to make it look like Mueller is not as compromised as he actually is.'
'only so he can exonerate them . Mueller is one of them. '
"That's great but Mueller needs step down/be removed before it becomes Mueller investigating Mueller's connections to Russia.\n"
"Prediction:\nWhen you watch a magician do an illusion, you don't realize that the actual trick is done before the set-up is through.  \n\n\nThis investigation will be open and closed in less time than it took me to read the story, and the Podesta brothers will be found not guilty of any impropriety.\n\n"
'You know what\'s hilarious? EE in the UK blocks that archive link on a prepaid SIM. How\'s that for "nothing to see here"?'
"I can't wait until Mueller gives them all immunity!  I wonder if he has already written John Podesta's innocent letter"
'its like when 2 alligators are in the swamp next to each other and one thinks the others leg is food and he just rips it off in that barrel roll thing they. psssshh nothing personal kid.'
'**WARNING - WARNING**\n\n*A great way to hide evidence is to "investigate it"...* \n\n**SOMEONE *ELSE* BESIDES THE PERP HAS TO INVESTIGATE THE CRIME**'
'Who cares about a servant investigating his master'
"Why didn't they raid Podesta's home unannounced like they did Manafort? They might have found a kiddie dungeon. I'm sure it's being cleaned up now. "
'Oh yeah.  Meuller is going to get to the bottom of the Podesta items.  Hold your breath.'
"Mueller is not there to investigate, Mueller is there to exonerate. Liberals NEVER face the consequences of what they do. It's just one of the many reasons we HAVE to keep them out of power."
'This to me seems more and more like Mueller was put in place to cover up everything.'
"I don't believe this- not one bit.\nEverything we know tells us the fortunes of the Clinton's-Obama's-Podesta's-Comey-Mueller ALL inextricably linked.\nThis is pure BS- Mueller might claim to go after Podesta's to lock down information and prevent it's release- solidify cover up- provide immunity and absolution\nSame as was done by Comey during the supposed server investigation. He gave immunity to all material witnesses- to silence them- or permit their lies unchallenged- either way\nNOT A CHANCE Mueller truly goes after Podesta's"
"Corruption investigating corruption. Yeah, a whole lot is going to come out of this. It's a shame all of the high profile investigations are done by this one guy. So much trust in him."
"Funny didn't hear about this much anywhere "
'He will absolve them. Who will investigate the investigator???'
"Isn't this the way it keeps going.  The rest of the United States who did not believe in or vote for Trump are waking up, I am sure!"
'I feel like we knew this already'
"Let's not forget that Rod recommended the James Comey firing which then led to the special counsel that HE HIMSELF appointed!  Unreal."
'He wasn‚Äôt supposed to win '
"My liberal co-workers are furious. I mean the butt-hurt level left 11 behind and is now rising to 25. I haven't seen them this furious since November 9th, 2016.\n\nThey are angry and raising their voices. They are talking over each other. It‚Äôs hilarious. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre drowning and clinging to each other to not drown and aren‚Äôt aware that they‚Äôll only end up drowning as a group.\n\nSummary: The memo is fake! There‚Äôs still a chance for impeachment because the Republicans won‚Äôt allow the release of the Democrat memo which is the real memo that says the Nunes memo is wrong so all we have is a fake memo and that means Hillary still has a chance to win. One quote: ‚ÄúIf you had a brain at all, you‚Äôd know this is probably a sham since there‚Äôs another memo so why would there be another memo if the first one wasn‚Äôt full of lies?‚Äù\n\nThen they went into how the investigation will go on and how Mueller will present his findings and they should keep it going till November when the results will make the most impact even though the Republican Congress won‚Äôt vote to impeach but Trump is guilty as hell and no phony memo is going to change their mind and if the findings about collusion and obstruction are really bad, it will help Democrats take back Congress.\n\nThe champagne is still in the refrigerator; it‚Äôs getting really cold; they can‚Äôt wait to open the bottle.\n\n(!!!)\n\nIt‚Äôs fascinating. They are determined to die on Muh Russia Hill; the contents of the memo mean nothing to them, because they are so invested in getting rid of the orange jerky jerk face, and they are so dedicated to Hillary, Obama, et al, that I think we could present video evidence of Hillary baking cookies mixed with the baby parts from Planned Parenthood and they‚Äôd still say she should be president because she won the popular vote and Russia hacked the election.\n\nThey‚Äôre acting as if this memo truly means nothing, and thus nothing will change, but if what we‚Äôve read is anything close to the truth, I cannot imagine how Mueller can keep going."
'I think what we all learned today is to never, ever, under any circumstances ever talk to or contact the FBI about anything ever again.  \nTerrorist plot?  Grab a firearm and handle it yourself.  \nThe FBI can no longer be trusted for anything.  \nThanks, Obama.  '
'I‚Äôm absolutely amazed at how nothing about this memo is on the front page or /all/. But surprised? No. It‚Äôs fucking reddit censoring as usual. '
'It‚Äôs time for final preperarions folks. The 2nd amendment exists for this purpose. When the liberals try to break the law and remove President Trump, we all must stand up and defend him with every means possible and available to us as citizens.\n\nWe are ready up here in New Hampshire.'
'The memo highlights the fact that they had nothing on Trump, they had to make up a fan fiction in order to get anything on their application!'
'let me get this straight all those involved are saying this memo NOW means nothing... \n\nbut just yesterday: STOP!!!! THIS WILL END AMERICA!!!'
'Nunes is savage on Fox News right now. Love this guy. '
'Well Carter Page was under surveillance since 2013, so how is the dossier considered as the thing that initiated his FISA warrent? '
'Man it feels good to drain the swamp '
'Surely this will be the end of trump!'
'Dems would impeach regardless of legal precedent.  You can take that to the bank !'
'And despite all that, if they dems get enough seats, they‚Äôll still successfully impeach trump for no reason.\n\nFucking traitors, the lot of them.'
"Another juicy tidbit that's not being mentioned enough.  The total number of FISA applications since the start of the secret court, the total number of FISA warrants issued, the percentage of successful FISA applications, and the fact that the initial FISA application against the Trump campaign was denied.  It's astonishing.  See for yourself."
'Nothing on redacted is ever this thoughtful. '
'Donald Trump must be the cleanest person out there....investigatuons starting may 2016 and find absolutely nothing.  Makes me even prouder'
"I was here for the beginning of the end to the Special counsel's phony 'Russia' investigation "
'#üé∂MY EYES HAVE SEEN THE GLORY OF RELEASING OF THE MEMOüé∂'
"I've been basically dancing around my house today like a goof. I can't dance worth shit! But I can't help it!! Weeee dawggie "
'So they used the FISA on Page as the thin end of a wedge to spy on the whole Trump team. And the FISA was obtained by hiding the bias, effectively by spinning a story to the court and saying "Trust us"'
"Hopefully Trump's team of lawyers is all over this."
' James Comey, June 8, 2017 testimony:\n\n> The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified.  Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing.\n\n Observe: Comey testified that he saw the dossier as a "salacious and unverified" attempt to discredit the President. Therefore on January 6, 2017 he personally briefed the President on the dossier to defend the incoming President. \n\n October 21, 2016; three months prior to that briefing, the FBI/DOJ FISA warrant application depends on the same dossier in order to get a warrant to spy on Carter Page. This warrant is renewed three times.\n'
"I suppose these got deleted, too. Just like all of Hillary's evidence. \n\n#Shut down the FBI"
'I found this part interesting:\n\nStrzok is a focus of their efforts. House investigators have long regarded him as a key figure in the chain of events when the bureau, in 2016, received the infamous anti-Trump "dossier" and launched a counterintelligence investigation into Russian meddling in the election that ultimately came to encompass FISA surveillance of a Trump campaign associate.\n\nStrzok briefed the committee on Dec. 5, 2016, sources said. But within months of that session House Intelligence Committee investigators were contacted by an informant suggesting that there was ‚Äúdocumentary evidence‚Äù that Strzok was purportedly obstructing the House probe into the dossier.\n'
'Wish we could start digging '
'> Strzok is a focus of their efforts. **House investigators have long regarded him as a key figure** in the chain of events when the bureau, in 2016, received the infamous anti-Trump "dossier" and launched a counterintelligence investigation into Russian meddling in the election that ultimately came to encompass FISA surveillance of a Trump campaign associate.\n\nIs this new information? Did we know, before the latest news of the text messages, that Strzok was a key figure in all of this? I dno recall ever hearing or reading his name before the recent news. '
"I can't wait for all of them to be wiped, like with a cloth! "
'His wifes divorce attorney will laugh all the way to the bank.....'
'DJT should make sure they are release the texts unredacted. Toired of all the secrecy. We are big boys and girls. We handle the Podesta un redacted  Emails just fine'
'Comey has announced he will voluntarily come out of retirement and analyze all 10,000 of them in 42 minutes, just to lend a helping hand.'
"I'm sure Strzok is pretty calm with those 10,000 dick picks being sifted through and leaked. "
'That\'s not ~~McCabe~~ "Peter Strzok"! This guy is rando cadaver photoshopped and *creeps me out everytime I see picture!*\n\n#We need to MEME McCABE INTO STRZOK!\n\nPoor General Flynn having to lie to "Strzok" (knowing he was McCabe of the "Bribed By Clintons" notoriety with fake mustache on).\n\nAnd texting? That. Is. So. 2010! And good way to get self brought up on charges ***are they stupid?!*** Hell even snapchat\'s better (and best with xposed workarounds). "Hey, Comrade McCabe, I have found a way to send secret messages that aren\'t GMAIL! It\'s called *Messages*!" **/face-fucking-palm**'
'How cute, they think "their" emails and texts were safe.'
'Sounds like they are looking at more forms of communication, or someone is putting out BS.'
"Whoooo wee, lads. Looks like the storm's here. "
"The DOJ is going to take forever to get these texts to the House Intelligence Committee. They're going to say that 10,000 text messages will take years to review."
'"Page and Chelsea Clinton competing for the lead role in the Mr Ed sequel."\n\n"10,000 texts?  When did they have time to work?"\n\n"It is very simple, arrest them and charge they with treason."\n\nThe comments on that link are so good, I have nothing to add.'
"Why was someone able to read the emails between Strzok and these other people to blow the whistle on them? \n\nIt wasn't a hack, right?  One party of the email correspondence turned them in to DOJ? Or does DOJ have the right to just look at all government officials' emails anytime they want to see what they are up to? \n\n Or was it Mueller looking at the emails of his subordinates and then blowing the whistle on them? That one doesn't seem likely.  Could be an eli5 thing where everyone knows what is going on here but I don't."
'Ukrainian businessman is like the total opposite of Russian government.'
'I cant tell if the people investigating Trump are more zealous than those investigating Clinton, or if the press just makes them seem wildly different by how they report on them.\n\nBut it feels like people were going out of there way not to find anything on Clinton, and they are going out of their way to find anything on Trump.'
'The redacted article is hilarious. Being paid for an appearance as a citizen is exactly the same as paying an ex-president whose wife is Secretary of State.'
'This is going to backfire miraculously like all other digs into POTUS. Guarantee it reveals more about Clinton and the deep state than anything else. '
"If Trump would have just set up a non profit to funnel money there'd be no issue..right? RIGHT?"
'CNN be like; ‚ÄúBut Ukraine is close to Russia!‚Äù\n\nThey aren‚Äôt sending their best. Year in and Mueller comes up with nothing. How long before we can slam some fake news laws down?'
'2 tier justice system.\n\ndeep state is out of control. doj is a fucking leftist shithole'
'Take every Presidential candidate and President for the last 40 years and put them under this same microscope.  Perform this same game with all of them.  Can you imagine the shit that would be uncovered?  Yet here they are more than a year later with Trump and they have nothing.  This is a pure desperation move.  It‚Äôs pretty sickening that it‚Äôs been allowed to continue uninterrupted for this long.  '
"I am so over and tired of this corrupt FBI/DOJ, and their inability to be even the least bit impartial.  I don't know how the President handles, but I am glad he does.  But the american people can only handle so much corruption."
'Meuller will add years to his jail sentence for each leak of Cohen‚Äôs attorney-client privilege documents for the rest of Meuller‚Äôs life.  Easy to spot the exact leaks and tie them all back to team Meuller.'
'Why can these loser Republicans not get a damn thing done. Voted Libertarian before, they failed me, republicans have failed me now. Aside from Jim Jordan and a few others, its a joke. A party based on limited govt, selling out for big govt projects in their hometowns. Hate to say it, but the Dems are kicking your asses repubs, get your s#!t together and save the free world. Also, no, we do not need to go to war again, quit sacrificing our rednecks for what, topple Assad? Why Syria is the safest country to be a Christian in over there. '

"Like I'll believe that one."

"I'm sure this is at the top of /all"
'Then why is the Special Council still going on? '
'I do believe that people were behind Trump back were doing shady stuff and using to campaign for their own interest instead of MAGA'
'Surely this is the end of Grumpf'
'If Trump is innocent, then the Special Council has no reason to exist.'
'That cuck Rosenstein is responsible for this fuckery.'
' But that Maddow fellow promised me Drumph was going to jail!?!'
'> The Post also cited legal experts who said that the president still could become a target of the investigation ‚Äì particularly if investigators get the necessary information from Trump during a potential interview.  \n  \nWhat a stupid way to phrase this. That‚Äôs basically saying we have nothing, but it‚Äôs possible that we could find something, we just need to look harder.  \nThey are essentially saying there is nothing, but wording it in a way that makes it sound like there is something or will be something. Shady...'
"This is great but they need to apologize for the way they've treated POTUS."
'‚ÄúThe Post also cited legal experts who said that the president still could become a target of the investigation‚Äù\n\nBahaha, I‚Äôll bet they did. They have ‚Äúexperts‚Äù on retainer. It could still happen, though!!!1!'

'‚Äú...but we sure did get some opposition research!‚Äù'
'Sleazy Muller, don‚Äôt trust this one ever. '
'OK. here‚Äôs what this means. If Mueller  can‚Äôt indict, he can‚Äôt force Trump to testify to a grand jury. '
'This was never about indicting POTUS  This has always been about creating a semi-plausible reason to push impeachment through.'
"Dan Bongino is right about this. It's a smoke screen and an attempt to gather info for impeachment. Trump is clean as a whistle. Amazing."
'Beep boop.  Fail... I was developing feelingggggggssss.  Uuuuuuu.   Please deactivate me.. beep boop.'
"And of course, they release a senate investigation that concludes that Russia did indeed interfere in the election (in vague ways) on the same day this news comes out. Keeping the Russia-Trump collusion dream alive.\n\nIt's basically what Trump had said all along. Russia may or may not have done some stuff in the election. They probably did, just as they did last time and the time before and the time before and so on.\n\nBut  here's the important part: **Trump had nothing to do with it.**"
"KEK <--This one\n\nKEK <---And this one.\n\nKEK\n\nKEK\n\nKEK\n\nNow the question is: Will we get funding for a big beautiful wall, and an end to the slow-rolling of the GEOTUS's appointments? \n\nHaving so many positions *still* left unfilled for long-standing posts so long after inauguration day is unheard of."

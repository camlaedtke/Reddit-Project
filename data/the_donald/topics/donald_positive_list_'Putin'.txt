'This is a good redpill '
"**We have to protect our elections from Russia! Voter ID now!**\n\n**If Democrats oppose voter ID it means they're Russian puppets working for Putin!**"
'That’s actually a genius way to trick run-of-the-mill dems to support voter ID'
"This is really genius.  Whoever made this, I'm applauding you from my office chair right now.  I know you cant hear it....but just.........use your imagination."
'I have less concern over Putin and more concern over Hillary and her Democrat empire using the fake votes to their advantage.  None the less, for our boys south of the boarder, we hope you get voter IDs!'
'Brilliant '
'Yes the leftists are that stupid.'
'Haha I genuinely thought this was on redacted or something '
'DO YOU WANT POOTIN TO RE-ELECT DRUMPF??????\n\n\\#DEMANDVOTERID !\n\nPerfection'
'Very smart. '
'We need voter ID! Only fair thing!'
'Oh, this is beautiful'
'Lol. This is too good'
'Oh this is good '
'Great meme, but honestly, im more scared of the dnc'
'Well it is Mexican interference at the least.'
'um...dont feed the russia narrative trolls please'
'As long as they vote republican. Come help Comrades!'
'Back left dude looks like he’s assassinating someone with his mind.\n\nIn another country.'
'Awesome! Got to make a meme like, do you want this man reelected via Russian votes? #Voteridnow!'
"Start spreading this, with luck it'll be on MSM in a week and Vox will have a video about why we need ID laws."
'Top kek. If this gets traction heads will explode, and POTUS may just make it real.'
'Lol cheeky fellow.'
"If we had a professional graphic designer who made these, I'm 99.9% sure that leftists would pick this up on Twitter and ***RAVE*** about it."
'Lmao.. Please circulate this on your social media. I think this would be a modern day Trojan horse '
'Good heavens! Russians can enter the country and vote without impunity? that sound abhorrent! '
'If all Trump did during his presidency was make voter ID mandatory, it would be worth it.'
'Well done!'
'I am impressed with the guy behind Putin - has the best "Don\'t Fuck with us" look I have seen in some time.'
'The Clinton-Putin collusion almost worked. Thank God the voters and Donald put a stop to their anti-America plans. #DemandVoterID #releasethememo'
'Na there\'s no need for basic ID. Instead we need a massive surveillance state to monitor every communication on planet earth, including all US citizens, judges, congressmen, everything. Because the russians might get into peoples heads through words and memes. Monitoring the words and thoughts of all white people on earth in case they wrongthink and become a "bot", is what we need to do. Make sure to try and manipulate everyone\'s feelings by actively paying people to "correct the record", and passively manipulate everyone\'s google searches, facebook feed, twitter trending topics and twitter feed. Much less expensive, much more practical and much less dystopian than forcing someone to go to the DMV to get an ID!'
'But everyone who supports voter ID laws is an alt-right white supremacist (Justin Trudeau) or an anti-immigrant Islamaphobe (Angela Merkel)!'
'Is dis on twatter yet to admire comrade?'
'Even if Trump colluded with Russia, what could Mueller possibly say? \n\n"Yes, Trump told Russia to tell the Americans the truth. Had Hillary been able to run without people knowing about what her emails say, she would\'ve won. What a shame it is that the Americans don\'t know their president less!"\n\nIt\'s not like they rigged any voting machines or anything.'
'ok i see'
'We cannot make enough of this meme, nicely done.'
'Then how will democrats get all their votes?? It’s  voter suppression!! Why would we want American citizens to vote? '
'Trump already won every state with voter ID. \n\nWe should at least redistribute a few hundred votes to the dems ;)'
"I want voter ID laws.  With Democrats in charge and illegals voting, Putin doesn't have to bother interfering in our elections."
'How can we make this like the net neutrality meme '
'Someone make this look pretty '
'push this to liberal reddit sites they will devour it like macdonalds'
'thanks for the record high stock market putin. so kind of you to put america first!'
'Weird how the Left is so opposed to Russia interfering in our elections, but are fine with importing Mexicans to interfere in our elections. '
'Make it free at the poling places and it should work.  No ID.  Take a picture and send them on in the mail.'
"The most liberal estimate of incidence of voter fraud is 0.003%. Why do you focus on this issue? And do you realize you're only suppressing minority-area voting but claim you're not racists? Do you realize half the nonsense?"
'Get the Hypocrites out of power!  Get your friends to VOTE!'
'the left are disgusting. What the fuck did they want him to do, cause WWIII?\n\nThis is how progress is made. You make **FRIENDS**, not piss eachother off.\n\nGrow the fuck up leftists, sorry you lost an election. You have no chance next time but if you get your party in order and someone worth voting for you might have a chance in 2024. Until then, [**CHOO CHOO Motherfuckers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwDiPrFCM0M)'

'take care of your president americans. '
'Ron Paul, the original anti-establishment edge lord.\n\nFully red-pilled me during 08 run.'
'Ron Paul was my original red pill during the 2012 primaries '
"I know Ron Paul will never endorse a GOP candidate, and he has every right not to given what he knows and what he's done for this country, but it would be a day to remember if he endorsed Trump."
"When Ron Paul approves, you know you're doing something right."
'IMHO Ron & Rand Paul are the two most principled & honest men in D.C.'

'Based liberty merchant Ron Paul.'

ALERT! Comey's original Hillary memo has been released! It shows "evidence of felonies and misdemeanors " BUT Comey later edited that all out!
'IG report summary:  Yes he mishandled the classified material, but he did so without thinking he would get in trouble, so we must not punish him.  '
'Redacted be like "nuh uh" '
'And Kek was pleased. '
'I am pessimistic about all of this...The Swamp GOP has absolutely no interest in prosecuting these scumbags. Sessions has been quiet.\n\nI hope Trump declassifies everything for the House Intel. '
'Better write another book and hit Costco for that trial $$$$'
"Wouldn't it be ironic if Coney went to jail for what he absolved Clinton of?"
"By the same IG who just exonerated the FBI for wrongdoing in the Hillary investigation. Excuse me while I don't hold my breath."
'Hopefully they but the squeeze on him and he sells out the Clintons and Obama’s '
'I hope they take down that tall glass of poop juice...'
'A matter lol. Here we go again. I predict he’ll be cleared of all wrongdoing cause no intent'
'#the calm before the storm '
"Why hasn't there been a criminal referral for McCabe?\n\n"
'They could\'ve faded into obscurity.  Enjoyed retirement, and what they got away with (i.e. murder).  I don\'t think the Prez would\'ve gone after them, there was too much to fix, too much to MAGA.\n\nBut no.  They had to push.  They had to "resist."\n\nFuck these people.  I hope they choke on the justice that\'s long overdue them.'
"Wow. That's surprisingly ballsy for Republicans, especially by listing the names. Let's see if Jeff finally finds his gonads now. "
"So what you're saying is, only 11 Republicans in the House are truly MAGA"
"Don't worry. Sessions will do nothing "
'Sleeeeeepy Jeffffffff ... Time to awake from your 2 year slumber...\n\nI WANT A PERP WALK. '
'I really like the line about the difference in zealousness between the Hillary investigation and the Trump investigation.'
'Sessions wont do shit, that guy seriously needs the boot'
"Wake me when there's actually a grand jury or Sessions actually does something.  I can only get blue balls so many times before I'm desensitized."
'Lol I would be surprised if this happened. '
"WHY hasn't he been arrested and sent to jail?! He admits to perjury in his book. The double standards are rediculus!"
'>"I picked you to be FBI director because of your integrity and your ability," Obama said to Comey, according to excerpts released on Thursday. "I want you to know that nothing — nothing — has happened in the last year to change my view."\n\n>"Boy, were those words I needed to hear. ... I’m just trying to do the right thing," Comey replied, writing that he was on the verge of tears at the comfort Obama offered.\n\n>"I know, I know," Obama responded.\n\nThe head of the FBI, ladies and gentlemen. '
"I'll always love when Colbert told his audience that Comey was fired,  and they cheered.  Than Colbert had to correct the record,  and have them understand the DNC talking points.  "
'###I absolutely adore this madman.'
'Good morning Washington! '
"Please someone shop Comey's face on Slimer. "
"Our President doesn't ignore anything.  Someone says sh** about him, he talks sh** right back.  He really doesn't put himself above and on a higher plane of existence, he is here with us.   Well, I kind of think its a New York trait also.  "
'FBI became a joke with that son of a bit* Comey'
'Tweets keep on getting better. Phew Lordy!!'
'I love how he fights for the truth!'
'What an incredible honor to drain the Swamp!'
'Did Trump do the golden shower thing, no!  But was he concerned and wanting an investigation because he loves his wife but have skeletons in the closet, most likely...'
'VSM = Very Stable MADMAN!!!!\n\nLORDY!!!!!'
'Another top 5 Trump tweet. The list is miles long'
'This is in responce to Comey writing in his book.....that Trump was a grease ball and acted like a Mob Boss...or something to that effect.'
'#THIS MEME WINS THE INTERNET'
'This is just too easy at this point. You could make a new one of these every day for a year and still not crack 1% of its potential. '
'please tell me this is photoshopped'
"Wasn't this guy just a two bit lawyer before the Clintons picked him up because of his cowardly lack of morals and ethics? Hard to imagine that he had any loyalty to lady justice in the first place."
'Nice Maga!  Top KEK all around'
'TOP FUCKING KEK '
"Nice meme but that's her double."
'LOL awesome!'
'I gotta say, this is a high quality meme. Kudos to the meme magician who cast it'
"The more I see this the more I'm convinced it was a body double l."

'Now for the moral posturing from the left and Comey, Warner and Brennan only for Trump to be vindicated a little bit later'
'Gonna be good week '
"Nunez memo released to the public THE LEGAL WAY, ON A VOTE.\n\nLittle Schiff leaks memo the illegal way, bypassing vote from committee.\n\nTrump is teaching people how to win legally.\n\nOh, and we can say goodbye to Schiffs career as a politician.  He's done.\n\n"
'And just like that, he was known as the               \n#Little Schiff'
'Schiff just got nuked from freaking orbit! Love seeing these tweets before bedtime!'
'Leaking Schiff is a better nickname '
'LOL Schiff nuked from orbit before he even makes it to work on Monday morning.\n'
'Someone better lawyer up!  '
'Trump takes down five swamp rat stooges in one tweet. His Twitter is truly a weapon!'

'Schiff for brains is up to his bulging eye balls in corruption and all things bad... I hope they are closing in on the guy- '
"So, wouldn't this be obstruction of justice? "
'Dunno if I’m crazy... But it seems like some people were influenced by political affiliation when doing these edits. \n\n\nSpez: Source: [FoxNews](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/12/14/comey-edits-revealed-remarks-on-clinton-probe-were-watered-down-documents-show.html)'
'So... deleting 33,000 emails under subpoena using BleachBit multiple overwrite software and destroying devices with hammers rather than proper disposal protocols was not obstruction of justice?\n\nStonetear asking on Reddit how to delete emails from original archives was not a plan to conceal crimes?\n\nDeleting all the backups in the cloud.. unintentional?\n\nShe had the fucking server under her physical control PRECISELY SO she could circumvent justice.  She did it in order to be able to use Bleachbit or similar technologies.  \n\nHow is any of that unintentional?  She INTENDED it all, in fact she demanded it.  \n\n'
'Like Trump said last week, there is a lot of sickness in our government institutions. Time for the red pill, we need change. '
'Two-tier justice system, folks. Plain and simple. You know it. I know it. Everyone knows it.'
'They were really counting on Hillary winning if they thought they could get away with this shit!'
"Surely this was not written by either Comey or Strzok, but by a lower level group or person within the FBI. Then the document is passed up the chain and revisions are made. I wonder how that group or person feels about what transpired? Wouldn't it be interesting if that group/person within the FBI started to talk? Wouldn't it be interesting if that group/person were called to testify at congress, or at the IG's probe?\n\nComey and Strzok  have committed treason/sedition/conspiracy against the people of the United States. They should be dealt with to the full extent of the law. Perhaps a deal for them to be truthful and to give the whole story. Might I suggest life imprisonment instead of firing squad?"
'Here is the key question:\n\nWhat blackmail dirt did they have on Comey that they were able to force him to accept these edits??\nIn other words, if he was originally willing to basically incriminate Clinton, how could he allow it to be twisted like this into a forced exoneration letter? They either blackmailed or bribed him. Or he was in on it all along??'
"It's almost like the fbi was trying to soften the lamguage against Hillary to do the least damage possible. "
'Heaven forbid this reaches the top!'
'Cool when will we see some jail time otherwise it’s all talk and no action. And I don’t care '
'General Flynn pardon in 3...2....1'
"Everyone lies to the FBI. Even if you are telling the truth. All that needs to happen is for someone else to tell a different story. Then you get perjury.\n\nBTW, their was 2 FBI agents who interviewed Flynn. 1 said he was telling the truth, the other (PETER FUCKING STROK) said he wasn't.\n\nIt was McCabe(jail) who decided which one he would believe (jail)"
'Pardon Flynn. Jailing a general on a process "crime" is a disgrace.'
'I love the definition of "Shadey" on Urban Dictionary which Google shows me:\n\n"Someone who thinks their slick, and tries to insult the intelligence of others with their deceptions." \\[sic\\]\n\nThis is classic Trump \\- people will argue over the possible misspelling, ingraining the association with James Comey...'
"People involved with the Flynn case:\n\nPeter Strzok... disgraced\n\nAndrew McCabe... disgraced\n\nJames Comey... disgraced\n\nRudy Contreras... Also a FISA judge (shock) who was recused after accepting Flynn's guilty plea. Revealed later that he was also a friend of Peter Strzok and Peter Strzok had conspired with Lisa Page to set up a meeting with him."
'"Why would you ever vote for Trump?"  For statements like this!'
'PARDON FLYNN!!!'
'Nice nickname.  "Shady" James Comey.\n\nDouble plus good.'
'It’s a national disgrace what they did to Flynn. The guy served his country with honor and they threw it all away simply because he supported the President that they hate.'
"Didn't Trump fire Flynn?"
'Dropping truth bombs '
'He is going to pardon Flynn and they all know it. '
"It's okay though guys haha Mueller is our guy Flynn enjoys financial ruin and his reputation being shat on"
'Gen. Flynn is a good man. '
"Another purposeful misspelling. People are going bananas. \n\nFree press, free rent. He's a master troll lmao."
'Why is Nancy Pelosi worth 120m?'
'Sounds like Flynn might get a pardon'
'Good morning Mr. President https://i.imgur.com/MvNro6R.jpg '

'Pardon Flynn.'
'These are the questions that an honest media would be asking.'
'Pardon our war hero Mr president '
'Pardon him!!'
'Jim Shady, please stand up, please stand up.'
'Top level AAA grade Presidential shitpost.'
'Please pardon General Flynn'
"Hear me out. I think Comey is on Trump's side. This is a ruse a tweet. Comey is already turned, this is just a game to go after LL and Clinton Crime Family. I believe they already have evidence that HRC offered LL the Supreme Court in exchange for killing the investigations. This is corruption of the highest order. Once this was discovered, all the other crimes are petty in comparison. Think about it, corrupting the supreme court for political favors. Wow. "
'Pardon incoming!'
'"My twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth." - DJT, 2012\n\nLittle did he know back then that his Trump train had started breaking the sound barrier, and now like a phoenix, despite all the leftist shit, his glorious twitter dutifully remains draining the swamp...'
"Someone fill me in the details here? \n\nI didn't see Fox and Friends. "
'Comey is clearly afraid of something. Why is he going to the left stream media only instead of Fox as well? Why has he not taken Hannity’s offer? This should tell you everything you need to know.\n\nAlso, didn’t he leak to a left stream media source? '
'Deploy all “spy fly on the wall” assets to follow comey and McCabe now! \n\nI demand authentic amusement! '
'He totally read my comment pointing this out and posted about it. That’s hilarious '
'Trump has like 40 million twitter followers. His tweets are hugely important'
'Is it finally happening?  This certainly feels like the start of a happening.'
'Get ready folks '
'Is the first Twitter reply really just say “no u” to trump lol. '
'I would love to see Mr. James "Smugface" Comey get charged with perjury. If he really was after the truth, Mueller would have him charged already. '
"Isn't that illegal. Wtf are we waiting for. Arrest these dirtbags "
'Next on the wish list: John Brennan.'
'OK, (jail) is fucking hilarious'
'This man is single handedly taking on every corrupt institution in America.\n\nI loved Reagan, but Trump is on an entirely different level.  He is a fucking force of nature.'
'The answer is really easy, he was running a sham.'
'Today is going to be a good day.'
'Lmao GET EMMM'
'President Trump knows the answers to these questions. I know it, you know it,  we all know it! Lock Comey up and let him share a cell with Crooked Hillary. '
'Weather report for Sunday: Cloudy with a chance of a Trump Tweet Storm!'
'RIP Seth Rich'
'TO THE TOP OF REDDIT!!!'
'Is smoking gun evidence of Seth Rich taking the emails on that server so they hired a fake company to concoct a different narrative. Where the hell is the server right now?  Why isn\'t the intelligence community interested in what "Russian hacking" looks like? It\'s like the allies not being interested in the found Nazi radio that broke the Enigma code.'
'The wheels of justice move at a slow pace, pedes. They have to make sure there are no holes in there cases. The fact that the swampers are making insignificant moves at a fast pace shows their hand. This is weak bait for Trump. He is surrounded by people who are masters of this game. I am not worried by this. We just have to weather the Storm. '
'Even at 6\'8" Comey manages to come up small. He was a disaster as the FBI Director as he politicized a once proud institution. He broke all the rules of leadership, integrity, and Justice. He now continues to embarrass himself, the agency,and the DOJ. He writes a book to talk about tie length? Clearly he is unhinged and deserved firing.'
'Yes !   Hahhhahahhah. (Jail)'
"So our President knows full well that Mr. Weasel Comey exonerated Hillary before she or her aides were even interviewed. Keep in mind, Hillary wasn't even fucking under oath by the FBI, nor was Mr. Comey in the room with such a high profile target. How ridiculous is that? \n\nThis whole thing stinks to high heaven, it's going to take a lot of Drain-o to get this swamp drained."
'God Bless our President'
'OK AG Sessions. Your turn. You along with the new FBI Chief must have something. FoundaIts about time WE take back the narrative in DC. tion, Bill, Huma, Chelsea.....something. '

"You've got to be kitten me. That's the main reason I voted for this man, because he's the last person who stood a chance --- that called out the people in this government -  *exactly* for what they need to be called out on. "
"Funny how the alt-left is returning, yet again, to the fully debunked Russia narrative.  It's weird how their collective memory is shorter than Antifa's self-restraint."
'Also, downvote bots out in force today I see.\n\n5.9k points and only 64% upvotes for a tweet from the *PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES* pointing out some *PRETTY SERIOUS CORRUPTION*?  God forbid this hits r/all.'

'The left>>>> “OMG, TRUMP NEEDS TO STOP TWEETING!”. It’s the only way the actual truth gets out there. I’m sure they want him to stop. lol '
'how many people really need to go to jail for protecting hillary and all of the crimes against the people that happened during obama.... it would be hundreds easy.. probably a thousand honestly'
'Aaaand poof goes the obstruction of justice narrative.'
'MSM scurrying like cockroaches in an attempt to downplay this Comey tidbit...'
"this is exactly what happens when you don't play the game folks...  \n\nEnter in a special prosecutor who can now pardon and manipulate the law"

'Now prove he was told to do it by Lynch and she told Clinton about it. Please'
'I will admit these two facts:\n\nHillary Clinton is gross.\n\nHillary Clinton is negligent.'
'Remember folks HILLARY DID NOTHING WRONG and the FBI WAS NOT IN HER POCKET\n'
'Man... all this news, every day. It really seems like ITS HAPPENING.'
'Hilary is gonna have Comey as a "cellie". Some how I find this fitting :) Poetic Justice!'
'Comey edited it out, "like with a cloth"?'
'Wow so much happenings today, this plus the now district court Judge ordering the turn over of the Fusion-GPS bank records, PLUS Republicans taking control of the Virginia House truly has made this one hell of a day.'
'The swamp is out in full force tonight. They put out a NY Times hitpiece on our President and their obstruction of justice claim. The left are licking their lips. They think this is it.'
"Comey was never really in command, was he?  His 'subordinates' took control of his memo.\n\n>Ex-FBI Director James Comey’s original statement closing out the probe into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server was edited by subordinates to remove five separate references ...\n"
'It’s all starting to unravel! Exciting times my friends!'
'We need a special prosecutor to investigate this botched FBI investigation which is riddle with fraud!'
'Obstructing, like justice?'
'Holy shit, this is the best timeline! I seriously doubted that Hilary would EVER face justice for what she did. Seriously, she has gotten away with so much and never gotten any blowback for it by the MSM. '

'I believe Sessions and Trump are working very tightly on this and are crafting the illusion that they aren’t seeing eye-to-eye.   The media is so focused on Trump they’ll report on anything. Make some comments about Sessions and then let the media run with it while you handle business behind closed doors. '
'Why is he asking us where his Justice Department is?\n'

'LOL the first insane liberal to multipost to the top appears to be a furry from Germany LOL.'
'Nothing would make me happier than seeing James Comey led away in handcuffs for perjury.'
"The reason we will never see anything done about the corruption by Hillary, Obama, etc, is because of the swamp. Nobody in power (Sessions, FBI, etc) wants to go after them because they do not want anyone to do the same to them once they are gone. It's an unspoken rule of the swamp.\n\nThe elite protect the elite so that nobody ever has to accountable."
'Impressive length'
"I think POTUS is sending us all a message here. Nothing is going to get done if we don't demand it. I don't know what we are supposed to do at this point though. We can't fire anybody. \n\nI guess call our Congressional Reps and demand they seek some kind of action with regard to the DoJ?  "

DONALD J. TRUMP: Wow, watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked ‚Äúhave you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?‚Äù He said strongly ‚Äúnever, no.‚Äù He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends.
@realDonaldTrump: Wow, looks like James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton long before the investigation was over...and so much more. A rigged system!
'Wow, FBI confirms report that James Comey drafted letter exonerating Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete. Many people not interviewed, including Clinton herself. Comey stated under oath that he didn't do this-obviously a fix? Where is Justice Dept?'

Say What?!  They used it to convince a judge that Carter Page was a Russian Spy.  \n\nIt\'s like Comey thinks the Nunes Memo thing never happened, and the public doesn\'t know any more than we knew in March 2017.

'I think these are how our CIA assets in China got found out and killed back in 2010 or so. I think Clinton was a free lance Aldrich Aimes. I think the poor security was entirely intentional, I think she got good people killed, and I think she thought she was so clever for almost getting away with it. \n\nPerhaps the real reason China is changing tone in so many ways is that Trump has leveled the playing field in terms of intelligence gathering, which would take away a major advantage they seemed to have these last 8 years.

Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, sent a letter to the FBI on Thursday that shows the multiple edits to Comey‚Äôs highly scrutinized statement.\n\nIn an early draft, Comey said it was ‚Äúreasonably likely‚Äù that ‚Äúhostile actors‚Äù gained access to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private email account.

No parole.  No privileges. '
"That last original paragraph is an exact description of what Clinton did, and if trump was in her shoes he would be imprisoned for the maximum sentence. The (in)justice department in the USA and the integrity destroyed CIA and particularly crooked FBI have made a mockery of this country and the principles it was founded upon. All who are a part of it contribute to its decline, but none so much as those at the top. They are true traitors, and god will judge them, much more justly than we ever can, every single one of them, if not in this life then in the next. I truly believe that.

I would guess someone in her Org gave out ip's and access keys. No hacks required. Should really inspect the attachments. I would bet there is a treasure trove of information in the images.

It should be on some sort of record somewhere?  \n\nThis is important because Grassley asked Comey specifically about ANONYMOUS leaks. So aren‚Äôt McCabe‚Äôs and Comey‚Äôs statements unrelated? It seems like Comey could have answered Grassley truthfully even if he knew McCabe talked with the media, simply because Grassley specified ‚Äúanonymous,‚Äù and McCabe went through the legal non-anonymous channels.

"It's been known, among a lot of people my age who like history, that England passed the torch of the pay for play scheme along after WWII. The reason behind WW1 was England not allowing Germany or Russia to enter the world theater by expanding their economy or influence. The Democrats have continued to only allow Russia to participate IF they take their back alley deals, thus the sanctions. Russia made a power play and the DNC hammered them to keep Russia from making any move they don't approve of. \n\nThe result is Russia only knowing one way to deal with the US. Either by meddling in the Middle East and causing headaches for us or by crooked politics. Not saying they are innocent and we are all to blame but Clinton's involvement with Russia is hardly a surprise. "

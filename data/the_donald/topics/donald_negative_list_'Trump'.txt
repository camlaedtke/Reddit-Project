'No pulling punches today, no siree.'
"What is so difficult in getting an ID? You can use your passport, drivers license,  RealID, and other documents. In most countries around the world voting requires an ID. If you can drive around, get benefits, get work, buy alcohol, and countless of other things that requires ID, why somehow the minorities can't get ID for voting?\n\n"

"It's very simple. If you can't get your hands on a voter ID, then 1 of 3 things applies...\n\n1) You were never legally allowed to vote in this country, anyway\n\n2) You were too lazy to get one, so you probably shouldn't be voting, anyway\n\n3) You were too stupid to get one, so you probably shouldn't be voting, anyway\n\nThat's not racist.

'> California lawyer Lisa Bloom’s efforts included offering to sell alleged victims’ stories to TV outlets in return for a commission for herself, arranging a donor to pay off one Trump accuser’s mortgage and attempting to secure a six-figure payment for another woman who ultimately declined to come forward after being offered as much as $750,000, the clients told The Hill.\n\n> Documents also show Bloom’s efforts to get alleged victims of sexual assault or harassment to come out against Trump intensified as Election Day 2016 approached. When Harth, for instance, informed Bloom she had just made a Facebook post urging other women to come forward about Trump in October 2016, the lawyer texted back: “Wow Jill that would be amazing. 27 days until the election.”\n\nWow...this is huge...Lisa Bloom is the scum of the earth.'
'I cannot express the depth of my shock adequately. Because I have none. '
"Even Bill O'Reilly (accused falsely by her) is tweeting about it.\n\nNow the world will see these frauds for who they really are."
">“Ok let’s not do this then,” Bloom responded. “We are just about out of time anyway.”\n\nPretty shady, definitely a witch hunt, but still spinnable as Blooms persistence not indicating anything about veracity of claims. Let's keep reading shall we?\n\n>She said she considered coming forward with her account of an unsolicited advance by Trump solely to support her friend Harth, and not because she had any consternation with Trump, **who ended the advance when she asked him to stop**\n\nUmmm, so there wasn't actually any sexual assault or even harassment, just normal every day romantic/sexual interest that was terminated when it turned out to not be mutual. So Bloom continued pursuing the prospect of representing a completely innocuous interaction as sexual assault, just to take down Trump? And she wants us to believe that that's not also the case with the other cases (that were dropped or dismissed)? Whew lads. That's gunna be one tough spin.\n"
'Convenient that the Hill sat on this until after Roy Moore was defeated. Journalist integrity my ass. Now that their usefulness is over liberal media is throwing Bloom and Aldred under the bus. \n\nNext election cycle a new batch of scum sucking lawyers will take their place and it will be business as usual.'
'This should throw serious doubt into those allegations about Moore & cause a special investigation in Alabama because bother Lisa & her Mother Gloria do the same thing, just gotta wait for that other shoe to drop.'

I support Trump, but I think a much better approach to this type of thing would be privatization, and decentralization to the states... not more federal government spending.  The enormous national debt is no joke and it's only getting bigger.\n\nOut-of-control spending and National debt is a much bigger threat than Isis ever was. \n\nRon Paul and Rand Paul have the right idea about this."

Chuck doesn't care, he makes promises and spends taxpayer dollars carelessly because if he doesn't then 'people will die'. Bullshit. \n\nWhats actually going to keep this country strong is strengthening it's economy and bringing jobs back to the US. We surely aren't going to tax our way to a solution especially with all the useless, inefficient hair-brained entitlements programs dems want to implement.\n\nDemocrats are literally parasites, they won't kill America in one decade or maybe even two, but we can only endure a certain level of incompetence for so long before our livelihood is jeopardized.

That would discourage them from participating and they\'d finally give up.  \n\nSo what we do in the college and job market is we have a special Olympics for minorities called affirmative action to give them a sense they won\'t always lose if they compete in our system.  The problem is that we don\'t treat it like a special Olympics, we pretend they are in the same contest but they get an easier set of criteria, and that can be hard to take if you lose a spot to someone less qualified.\n\nBut the facts are that family connections also get people into places for which they aren\'t qualified.  As a white male, I\'ve lost jobs to less qualified white males who had family connections that I didn\'t have.  So a world without affirmative action is still not fair.  I don\'t see anyone calling for abolishing legacy college admits, or family connections in hiring.\n\nIt hurts, but telling less qualified people they always get to lose, every day, in every situation, is what leads to socialism.  I see affirmative action as a small price to pay to avoid socialism.  Making sure that people are motivated to perpetuate our system is what keeps it healthy.  Of course, if all they do is go to college and run for office as socialists, we\'re further behind than when we started.'

Then you had Antifa and what they think is less trumpeted (Communism). But I care less what you think. I care if you act.\n\nBoth sides beat on each other and then the tragic car incident. But when it comes to blame, back go to what these groups are perceived to think. And Nazis always get more points on the bad scale than Communists. \n\nSame with Islamic Terrorists. They are following the exact laws of the Quran and Haddiths. But most Muslims are trying to follow Islamic ideology peacefully. That doesn't mean Islam is peaceful per se. Just that the people following it are trying to take what they can from it and live peaceful lives. So that is what people perceive when you think of Muslims and Islam. The other guys, the so called Terrorists. They must be the ones not following it. Because that is what we believe.\n\nA White Supremacist? Well they already are bigoted or so we think, so it's self fulfilling."

And they will use them up and drive them into the ground if it means they can indoctrinate and convert even some of their target audience. \n\nWhy expendable? Because these same people own the very concept of money. They own the Federal reserve and all major international banks.

Through dwindling ratings) - once they are used up, they will be discarded. \n\nNew options will either be created from scratch or what is more common - new independent ventures are *bought out and infiltrated*.

It's the key issue, I reckon. The corrupt Dems are importing voter blocks, under the guise of humanitarianism. In turn, it means the Dem's don't have to bother, you know, being not corrupt, or actually trying to have policies people want. The end point of this corruption - they try to foist fucking Crooked on the world, at which point you guys finally said 'fuck that'. Well done. \n\nNaturally, I've never even visited the US.

"So the self employed, and  those working in small businesses that don't get company, group insurance but have to buy their own will now have their rates at least double because of no subsidies?"
"That's what libs don't realize is pissing us off. I don't want people to go without insurance if they need it. I just don't want to pay for it, and I don't want to be legally required to have it from the private insurers the government selects. That's the most dictatorial things that's been done in this country in decades. Forcing the people to spend their money at a private business that doesn't really do diddly dick. I go to the doctor maybe once a year and I'm in good health. I'd much rather pay the $150 one time for that visit than pay $200 every month all year. It's horse shit. "

'>The protests in a league where African Americans make up the majority of players \n\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa...  what about *diversity*?'
'Most tax breaks for pro sports teams/stadiums are usually handed out by the State and local governments. The NFL usually get their tax breaks because there is an emotional connection to the team and no politician wants to be seen as the one that drove the team out of town. Now, the NFL favorability is so low that every local politician will probably veto any potential tax breaks. \n\n'

I don't know how long it will take before we have REAL statistical data IN THIS COUNTRY supporting a solution one way or another, but either way we have to DO SOMETHING. Please stop bickering, please stop going in the endless cycle of my way over your way. People are dying. Yes, there are other areas of society affected by guns, but for the love of Jesus can we just focus on this one in particular. It's sickening. It's pathetic. Americans are better than this. Our history, the people before us would be outraged and disgusted by what we have become. I KNOW they would take action. I KNOW they would make us realize how pathetic we now are.

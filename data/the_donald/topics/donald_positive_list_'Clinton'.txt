Hillary Clinton Asked "What Happened To Seth Rich" At Book Signing
@DJT: FBI Agent Peter Strzok, who headed the Clinton & Russia investigations, texted to his lover Lisa Page, in the IG Report, that “we’ll stop” candidate Trump from becoming President. Doesn’t get any lower than that!
'Huma! LOL'
'Advocates for open borders, but sits behind a WALL of security guards. 🤔'
'#HIS NAME WAS SETH RICH'
'I just realized that conservative American women will save the republic.'
'She left out "How did it feel to get chucked into a van like a side of beef?"'
'That nervous laugh was too funny.'
"Bruh, I want to watch this but I can't do awkward stuff. What happens pedes?"
'TFW most of your line are Trump supporters trolling.'
'Should have been the first question and made sure she was looking up.'
'The woman filming has bigger balls than an entire NFL team. She is a hero! Who is she?'
'That bonus Huma question made me lose it, was not expecting any more to the video after ol hildawg got grilled.'
'Is it true that team Clinton invited Seth Rich to join them one week before he was murdered inside that Washington DC hospital?'
'This is the level of shitposting that every good man or woman aspires to.'
'My god. Someone is going to be suicided so fast. '
'what a time to be alive'
'Damn. That girl brave '
'Can we please make this a trend. '
'10 ton balls on this chick. I like her. And then she went for Huma! Holy shit, the fucking enormous chandeliers on this one. I love this chick.'
'The camera woman has what we call YUGE LADY STONES!  Well Done!'
"I know this woman at least lurks here and I'd like to say thank you. "
"Dakotas here. All symbols of White men ought to be destroyed. Look what we did to the Native Indians, forced to get rich from oil royalties, gambling plus reperations.\n\nStart with statues, pictures and literature to follow. Next, target infrastructure like bridges, roads, water systems, gas systems, and electric grid. \n\nSchool systems, media, and government organizations are safe, because they're indoctrination machines."
"This needs to stop, no matter what side you're on or whose statue you're tearing down. It's exactly what the commies waiting in the wings want... They're getting us AND them to do their fucking bidding. \n\nDo NOT stand for physical reminders of history being demolished, regardless of whether we like them or not! \n\nIf we eliminate all evidence of the past (the end game for this statue bullshit) then that's one step closer to, as Orwell said, an endless present in which the Party is always right. "
'How about not destroying any statues at all? Has ISIS taken over America? Jesus Christ.'
"Stop obsessing over statues.\n\nWe are not the alt-left.  We're better than them and should have better things to do."
'"Excuse me but this doesn\'t fit MUH NARRATIVE so pls stop" - liberals'
'No!  That statue needs to remain forever. It just needs to be re-labled "RAPIST". I want to ensure that my great-great-great grandchildren know that scum for who he is. '
"I wouldn't sexually harass them.\n\nBill MUST have issues"
"Please don't support this. It only will make us look like huge hypocrites."
'These are seriously 2 of my favorite women. They always pop up when Trump needs them most. '
"I'm surprised there hasn't been a Clinton iconoclasm in Arkansas yet"
'this one I actually agree with'
"One of the best examples of CTR / ShareBlue / Whatever trolls.\n\nThey attack everything on Fox. But on this comment section they are completely absent. Haven't got their talking points sheet yet? been told to stay clear? eerie"
'Hannipede will be on FOX & Friend this morning. '
'Most of the time foreign entities have to pay big money to influence other’s elections, in this case they GOT paid to do it. \n\nNot sending their best'
'This is almost too easy. What’s the deep state’s move here? '
'Targets eliminated. Hopefully. Soon. Been a long time coming.'
'The deep state is literally tossing Hillary out like a side of beef. What a timeline!'
'Get ready for an influx of "suicides"'
"Is there anything that Crooked Hillary does that isn't illegal and crooked"
'This is important.  If they only did the one article on fusion gps that means they are still trying to protect the Clintons.  '
'And.... watch nothing happen. I swear that the Clintons can do ANYTHING they want and get away with it!! '
"Thought just occurred to me when someone else here said, he thought trump instructed sessions not to go after hillary (before he recused himself) or it would look like a witch hunt\n\nConsidering everyone here has been chomping at the bit for sessions doj to do something about her - thinking about it, he never needed sessions or the doj to go after her (at least not initially). All he needed was a couple of good investigative reporters to 'break' the story and the doj pursuit would eventually follow................"
"I doubt any justice will be served. It's hard not to be pessimistic. "
'The Wall Street Journal is also saying that this is HUGE '
'I did learn something new here. Bill Clinton has a fucking penthouse on top of his library?? Did taxpayers pay for this? Do taxpayers normally pay for presidential housing on top of their libraries?'
'Nice knowing you Bill, good thing for you is Hill dog will be stuck in a separate cell far away from you.'
'He doesn’t know anything, just trying to predict the happenings to gain followers.'
'So now we know why they were so eager to suddenly sail him down the river'
"This story verifies what Jared Paul Stern said a decade ago was true. It also shows that Bill could use the FBI and DOJ to serve his political will even after leaving the White House. For those who don't know, here's the Wikipedia primer. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Paul_Stern"
'It’s a win win. If they’re being sincere, then Bill Clinton is a rapist. If they aren’t, the left has to admit that accusers sometimes make this shit up.'
'This is as big of a surprise as when the sun came up this morning.\n'
"With the ways the Dems are throwing the Clintons under the bus, they shouldn't complain when the inevitable indictments start flying against Crooked Hillary and Rapin' Bill, right?"
'Can the immunity deals that Obama handed out like candy be undone at this point? '
'I came in here prepared to delete my account if this was a shitpost.'
"The investigation has been complete for years.  All we need is someone to accept it, instead of throwing away it's conclusion."
'May God above forever bless\nThe oft malignèd 4D chess!'
'Hillary going to prison would be a good start, but in my opinion Obama (Soweto) and all of the DNC cronies need to share the cell.'
'The calm before the storm'
'I will take this seriously when immunity deals are stripped and the FBI reveals it did not destroy evidence that was turned over by Mills, Abedin etc. '
"#[Why aren't I 50 felonies ahead, you might ask](http://i.magaimg.net/img/1mmv.gif)"
'Pedes, remember FBIAnon said:\n\n"Mainstream media is shit. Who cares what they say. They are attempting to distract by putting the focus on Hillary\'s emails and not the Foundation."\n\nAnd:\n\n"We have our hands tied. Do not get distracted by Clinton\'s e-mails. Focus on the Foundation. All of the nightmarish truth is there. The e-mails will pale in comparison."\n\nNot saying the emails aren\'t hugely important - but let\'s never stop digging on the Clinton Foundation.'
'They need to get the crooked FBI that saved her ass and gave everybody immunity too. Hillary is pure evil, but there is something especially egregious about those who are supposed to give you justice, USING the justice system to make the bad guys invulnerable!'
'What kind of journalistic article begins that way, “The Department of Justice has caved to pressure from the White House...”\n\nCaved?  Really?  How do u know that?  Can’t they just be doing what they are paid to do?  The right thing?'
'Looks like more than Hillary’s house is about to burn down!'
'Just like that!👌🏻'
'LOL no wonder she burned her house down. \nGUILTY WRITTEN ALL OVER HER ASHY HOUSE'
'The fact that nothing has happened lowers my confidence in the nation as a whole. We literally had the Anti-Christ in power for decades and nothing was done because everyone was being a little bitch about it.\n\nI pray Trump finally puts this beast to rest so that the light of the country can be one step closer to restoration.'
'Till that family faces real charges for real crimes, are convicted and serve time, there is clearly no justice in America.'
'Praise Kek!'
'Damn. He’s done playing around, the Clintons and the DNC ruined their shot at freedom by STILL playing dirty'
'God Bless Trump.'
'LOL...no matter what happens Monday it will all work out in the long run for President Trump because GUESS FUCKING WHAT>>>\n\nHES THE POTUS MOFERS!!!  LOL....Bwahahahahaha....Bwahahahaha. \n\nRemember Remember the 9th of November\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGcaNY5eBWw'
'God this timeline is amazing!'
'has to be manafort..i mean his real estate guy testified in front of a grand jury....some financial stuff.'
"Again, the Lefties and Dems are getting all smug and think the hammer is about to drop on Pres. Trump. Remember the days leading up to the election? \n\nPres. Trump holds a lot of cards and needs little motivation to really put the screws to these people. If they were smart (and they're not) they would not be playing with this fire. I'm just glad I've got a front row seat to all this action."
"Tomorrow is my wife's an I 12 year anniversary.... A Podesta arrested would be the best gift ever\n\n\nOk maybe a HRC arrest but I don't think it will jump directly up to her so quickly"
'So Mueller investigates Trump for 8 months and last we heard it turned to Podestaaaaaaas and we have indictments. \n\nI wouldn’t be surprised to see that weasel Manafort as well. '
'#HELL YEAH BOYS, THE STORM IS HERE!'
'Game on, we all have waited for this 1 year of waiting was the price we all have paid. Enjoy the show.'
'Merry Christmas, Crooked Hillary.'
"I hope the hard drives storing them aren't as fragile as the IRS ones"
'Calm before storm ring a bell?'
'Omfg YES'
'Hillary looks like a dude in a wig in that picture.'
'Thank you daddy'
'Our president is a Savage I love it'
'But why now? Why not from the onset like he promised?'
'Has this administration  had any luck dismantling the deep state at all so far or wresting power away from the puppet masters behind Hillary and Obama?'
'See my top upvoted post for more information.\n\nSpez: https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/56pgaz/because_youd_be_in_jail_mic_drop'
'He’s backing them into a corner. Let’s say the DOJ doesn’t lift the NDA. Now people are looking at DOJ with distrust. What are they hiding?\n\nSame with the State Department. There’s nothing there, so there shouldn’t be any reason not to release, right?  But what’s that?  The President has now ordered it and they still won’t release?  What’s hiding in those emails?\n\nIt’s great because he’s not telling people what to think (a la MSM). They are coming to this conclusion themselves!'
'0 comments, lol. The left is scurred! '
'Color me surprised.  Please put people like Hillary in jail or stop teasing us.'

I'd love to see Brock dismembered for that move."
'This is another reason most people have absolutely no confidence in the FBI anymore. '
"Well, to be fair, Trump wasn't on their payroll."

'Any truth to claim he was Antifa motivated????'
'TL;DR, the FBI dropped the ball on this one like they did on the Pulse Night Club.\nGood job guys, at least you were investigating Trump.'
'To be fair to the FBI, they knew after 12 hours that Trump had ties to Russia. '
"I even heard this morning the FBI saying it wasn't terrorism or ISIS related. This was at 9am EST. "
"Why hasn't there been a criminal referral for McCabe?\n\n"
'They could\'ve faded into obscurity.  Enjoyed retirement, and what they got away with (i.e. murder).

I hope they choke on the justice that\'s long overdue them.'
"Wow. That's surprisingly ballsy for Republicans, especially by listing the names. Let's see if Jeff finally finds his gonads now. "

"Don't worry. Sessions will do nothing "
'Sleeeeeepy Jeffffffff ... Time to awake from your 2 year slumber...\n\nI WANT A PERP WALK. '
'I really like the line about the difference in zealousness between the Hillary investigation and the Trump investigation.'
'Sessions wont do shit, that guy seriously needs the boot'
"Wake me when there's actually a grand jury or Sessions actually does something.  I can only get blue balls so many times before I'm desensitized."
'Lol I would be surprised if this happened. '
'Surprise surprise. The degenerates all look out for one another. Once again the right is on the right side of history. '
'Now I see why HRC said they left the White House "broke." \n\n>As he tries to defend himself in Starr\'s investigation, Clinton has less to worry about in terms of his finances. With the creation of a new legal defense fund by Pryor in February, he is collecting a considerable share of his expenses, which totaled $6.5 million by the end of April, not including more than $1 million of costs related to the Jones case that were paid by insurance companies.\n\n>Trustees for the new fund reported that they have paid $1.25 million to Williams & Connolly, the firm handling Clinton\'s defense in the Whitewater, Lewinsky and other investigations, and expect to make another payment next month.\n\nspez: formatting'

'If Hillary had won, imagine the unlimited power that the pedophile power class would have wielded. This country would have slipped into becoming a broken, perverted serfdom ruled by degeneracy. Thank God for President Trump and We The People who said "Enough!" just in the nick of time. '
'I have to admit, I didn\'t think the Weinstein thing would explode like this and I\'ve been even more surprised with the number of instances where he seems to have very close ties to the Clintons.  \n\nI still don\'t quite understand where these accusations of Weinstein came from.  was he being investigated by law enforcement?  Is this, in some way, part of "Draining the swamp" that\'s meant to show the dirty path between Hollywood and the Dems?'
"Thanks for the Beejer, here's a throw rug for your knees."
"> Hollywood was quick to come to the president's aid. Among the 62 donors giving the maximum $10,000 were performers and directors such as Tom Hanks, Barbra Streisand, Michael Douglas, Ron Howard, Norman Lear, Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw-Spielberg as well as studio executives Jeffrey Katzenberg, David Geffen, Harvey Weinstein and Bud Yorkin."

This Q dude on 4chan/8ch appears to be correct so far... and the book really is nothing more than a compilation of the bullshit we heard all last year that has been debunked. The author notes in his prologue the book is not completely truth lol... and then Trumps tweets.. it just all seems like a cosmic joke. He made a ‘sad!’ Tweet about it this AM... trump only does ‘sad!’ Tweets when he is being sarcastic/sardonic....... \n\n\nI can’t wait to see how this all ends and I am betting like every other time, Trump comes out looking like a champ.

Trump gave Putin info that helped prevent terror attack in Russia
I got severely criticized by the Fake News Media for being too nice to President Putin. In the Old Days they would call it Diplomacy. If I was loud & vicious, I would have been criticized for being too tough. Remember when they said I was too tough with Chairman Kim? Hypocrites!
'What we really need to do is trap them in a corner with their "Voter ID is rasict" argument. Turn it around on them and show them how racist they are for assuming people of color are to dumb or lazy to get an ID.'
'## Don’t let Drumpf steal the election again in 2020! Resist!!! Voter ID now!!!\n\n\nEdit: gotta say I’m digging the poison pill strategy here. We could do the same to get transparency in campaign finance. Something to the effect of:\n\n“Cut Trump off from his Russian financial backing, we transparency in campaign finance!”'
"lol This makes sense and shows how retarded liberals are. They claim our elections are incredibly easy to meddle in yet they are against Voter IDs which would put a stop to most meddling happening in our elections\n\nReally, they just want to cheat but don't want others to cheat back. That's why they hate the idea of Voter ID"
"If they don't support voter ID, the left would have to be nothing but a bunch of shrill, disingenuous offenceophiles obsessed with appearance over substance. \n\nSo basically no chance.\n\nGreat fucking meme though. "
'Literally the best post on here in a year.  Genius on so many levels, they already believe Russia meddled but "no proof it affected voting outcome" so it can\'t hurt trump, only hurts their "cause".'
'republicans want voter ID security because they are afraid of voter fraud. democrats dont want that because they want the cheating to occur.\n'
'"Putin will fuck up all of our elections with fraud and shit!"\n\n"Voter ID would make that a lot harder."\n\n"OMG Shut the fuck up I hate voter ID there is no fraud all elections are perfect except for Trump\'s and W\'s."'
"The only problem is most people don't know the difference between loose and lose.  The moderate illiteracy of most people will harm this meme."
'Liberals: GUN OWNERS NEED LICENSES FOR NATIONAL SECURITY!\n\nAlso liberals: voter IDs would discourage minorities and the poor'
'When did we lose the ability to spell lose?  I keep seeing loose being used incorrectly, how did this happen?  '
'In the span of one conversation about election hacking I literally had a liberal coworker come back when I suggested voter ID, with "That\'s insane. Thinking someone committed fraud in this election is a conspiracy theory."'
"Trump HATES voter ID as it empower minorities.\n\nDon't let him do it again!"
"I wish they'd fall for this one but I think they know where more illegal votes are coming from."
'23D Chess?\n\nAdmits Russia meddled.\nHe played no part.\n\nWe need to crack down on voter fraud and meddling.\n\nShareblue gets banned from redacted\n\nWin'
'Trump should deploy DHS minders to every polling place... and videotape everyone who comes and goes.  and use facial recognition to enforce arrest warrants, and capture Illegal aliens.  anyone who shows up at more than one polling place, goes to prison for no less than 5 years.\n\nObama declared polling equipment "critical infrastructure"... fine.  then the feds need to take it all out of the hands of george Soros\'s company, and establish a n agency to count all votes for ANY federal election.\n\nNo Voter ID, then votes for that state aren\'t counted in any federal election.  Illegal alien and vote? instant 10 years added to your sentence.\n\nIts way past time to make voter fraud a class A felony.'
'Every single fucking left policy is hypocritical to it\'s core and I can\'t stand it:\n\nThey are anti-death penalty if you\'re guilty, but if you are innocent and haven\'t exited the womb yet it\'s just an option to kill you.\n\nThey claim we are anti science for the new ice age/acid rain/global warming/climate change (whatever they keep changing it to cause it\'s fucking lies) "deniers", but males and females are 100% equal in all aspects and there\'s like 300 genders, most of which are just how a person feels.\n\nThey are pro-choice, unless you want to not adopt their groupthink and learn their new age words for shit. Pro-choice unless you want to own a gun, or unless you wanna choose to practice your religion in peace and not bake some gay cake??\n\nTheir solution to the racism that has existed in the past is to just be racist to the people who were on top. The opposite of racism isn\'t being racist to the people who used to be on top, it\'s not caring about ethnicity at all, which of course now is considered racist, somehow.\n\nThey are anti-cop, anti-gun, and pro big government programs?? What!?\n\nAnd of course on topic, they are bitching endlessly about voter fraud and are also the ones fighting to keep it that way. Uh huh.\n\nIt\'s like a good portion of the Humans on this planet are going completely off their feels and are too disinterested or stupid to do some research. At no point in life do these people say to themselves, "Why do I hold this belief?"\n\n'
'Don’t call me stupid for asking this hut is this post for or against demanding a voter ID? Lefts seem to be afraid of meddling in election and rights seem to be afraid of illegal immigrants voting. I thought both sides agree on this :/'
"No. we don't need to enable this conspiracy theory to get voter ID passed "
"You know what? I actually forgot about that. If he would have called Putin bald and gay, they'd scream about World War 3."
"Ridiculous hypocrisy. I keep repeating myself but it's really a simple truth, Trump improved relations with a hostile nuclear power. Trump made nuclear war *less* likely. He worked for peace, and against war. And liberals criticize that just to make trump look bad. it's ridiculous.\n\ntrump is a historically good president."
"Damned if you do, damned if you don't\n\nor, translated into MSM:\n\n**REEEEEEEEEEEEEE!**"
"I've been saying this all week, it's a friggin diplomacy meeting, does anyone expect him to go to Russia and start karate chopping people? Did any president ever travel somewhere to condemn and punish them?"
'Fake News have one agenda, destroy Trump. The Stormy Daniels 2.0 Fake News story is top story all over the world. Fake News world wide have gone crazy, they all suffer from TDS'
'Yup.  No matter what,  you will always be vilify by the left.  The Democrats are violent bullies with no moral standards.  Democrats should be labeled as a domestic hateful socialist terrorist group.'
'Mr President, no matter what you do, the corrupt leftists & MSM will criticize you.\n\nIgnore them, us patriots are on your side!'
"He knows there is no winning. Push too hard its moving us towards world war 3. A more diplomatic approach and your Putin's wife. Do what you're gonna do. You know MM is going to go against you just out of spite. "
'If President Trump cured cancer and landed men on Mars the libtards would shit on him for putting Doctors out of work and invading another Planet '
'FUCK DEMOCRATS! FUCK THE MEDIA, YOU BETRAY OUR TRUST!!'
'Ignore fake news MSM. Fuck em\n\nJust keep keeping on, trump!'
"An entire Washington industry has been built around cold war with Russia.  The principals, such as CIA Director John Brennan, may not want to see it go away, this cold war.  In a perverse way, we could be talking about conflicts of interest, \nbut we can'r say that. Why? because if it were true, it would be more than the American public could handle."
'Progressives in 1968: “Make love, not war.” \nProgressives in 2006: “Bush lied, people died.”\nProgressives in 2018: “Why the fuck isn’t Trump destroying Russia?”\n\nThis is exactly why I woke up and got red-pilled many years ago. There is no doctrine, no moral foundation...nothing...when it comes to Progressive ideology. It’s literally “whatever the fuck is convenient today is what I believe”. '
'Have to disagree with GEOTUS here... see, Rocket Man is nonwhite, so you can’t be rude to him even if he starves his own people for the lulz. Putin, on the other hand, is white, so you must aggressively denounce him if he spends peanuts to shitpost weak pro-trump memes under Obama’s nose.'
"If Trump cured cancer. Solved world hunger. Discovered faster than light travel. Solved the meaning of life.\n\nThey would still hate him. Don't worry about people that hate for the sake of hating someone.\n\nIt's means there is no discussion between the parties. They don't want to be part of a modern society."
"> Remember when they said I was too tough with Chairman Kim?\n\nTRUMP IS SUCH A BULLY PICKING ON A LITTLE GUY BUT NICE TO PUTIN BECAUSE HE'S A BULLY COWARD REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\n\n~ somewhere on r/etarded right now..."
'Our Country’s biggest enemy is the Fake News --- GEOTUS'
'"Remember when our president had balls" shows picture of Obama....\n\nR/pol is the most useless group of idiots ive ever been banned from after calling them useless idiots before. And r/islam didnt like it that much either!'
"Damned if you do damned if you don't in the land of the Damned. "
'Reagan correctly called them \'The Evil Empire-" he was right, and they flipped their lids. It was awesome.'
"The whole Russia thing is the default backup plan when it's a slow news day. They will talk about this bullshit until he's out of office. Does anyone here still actually watch the fake news anymore? Does anyone here actually seek out news online on fox, CNN, MSNBC... Etc? It's all lies. All of it. Strange"
'I can see his loud & vicious tweet now "Putin, the bald loser thinks he can control the president with $400m bribes. Too bad I won the election (in a landslide)"'
"There is not one thing the left stands for that is foundational to the American principles or founding Amendments and Declaration of independence.  They should be clearly labeled as Domestic threats and be arrested for true treason. We are not talking about people who just live life and disagree with a few things. No. They absolutely do not support anything that is American.\n\n They support socialistic and communistic ideologies. Those are unAmerican.\n\nThey support the killing of innocent babies in abortion.  That is a direct violation of the Declaration of independence that says all men are driven the right To Life by God(Creator). \n\nThey support the destruction of the nuclear family (man, woman, children). And think mental illness such as Homosexuality and transgender is ok. Yet scientifically it is worse in all regions of the human body and spirit. \n\nThey openly speak out against the amendment of free speech and the right to carry a weapon for any reason\n\nThey openly don't care about the American culture and support every possible culture that is not American. \n\nAnd to top it off sweet, is they Hate God outright and anyone who has a relationship with him. \n\n. \nCan anyone tell me what is it that they stand for that gives them the right to say they are in support of America? Because of you are not that is 101 terrorist or domestic threat. Not an American. "
'Eh, potus, its a rigged game. Its not weather u win or lose its u win you lose falicy'
'Yeah! What a bunch of losers!\nAs if having a Russia as an ally instead of having WWIII is a bad thing!\n\nDamn! \n'
'Liberals: WTF I hate diplomacy now.'
"The Ying-Yang is the modus operandi of the sick LSM. If the President Yings, they complain, and wonder why he didn't Yang. If the President Yangs, they complain, and wonder why he didn't Ying."
"They say that Russia is the enemy (when they're actually not) and try to be all patriotic but when it comes to immigration we know that they don't really care about the state of the country"
"The CIA lied about WMDs in Iraq, leading to US intervention which killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and set the stage for the destabilization of the Middle East and the rise of ISIS. They helped train and fund ISIS and Al-Qaeda. They instigated and prolonged a civil war in Syria which has killed over 600,000 people so far. They toppled democratic governments and replaced them with dictatorships. And they're the left's champions who can do no wrong."
'The same dipshits that were crawling all over the streets in System Of A Down music videos protesting G.W. Bush are now advocating world war. This administration has shown us the massive scale of the mental health crisis we face in the US.'
'"WTF?! I LOVE WAR-MONGERING RINOS NOW?!?!" - literally the left...\n\nI actually dont think some of them get tired of the outrage. They enjoy being angry and being led by their media handlers from one outrage to the next.'
'I was a huge fan of Ron Paul’s when he was running in the primaries in 2012. Everything he said just made sense. \n\nThey would ask him questions and he would give people history lessons and educate people. \n\nHowever, the media did something interesting to him. They blacklisted him. He would get like 2nd or 3rd place in those town hall Caucasus or whatever and they would only mention who got 1st and 4th and just skip him. \n\nI was in Florida at the time and remember driving to Miami for work. I saw Ron Paul banners and signs ALL the way down I-95. \n\nI am almost convinced it was the audit the fed stuff that did this too him. JFK wanted to take away power from the Fed Reserve by using those silver notes and then was killed. \n\nThe first thing LBJ did when he came in was reverse that. Could be a conspiracy but seems interesting to me. \n\nRegardless, Ron Paul was deemed a threat to somebody and they blacklisted the crap out of him. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/tjuUWr9vaXo\n\nGo RAND 2024!\n\n\n'
"Neo-Con holdover's from the Reagan era can seriously go fuck themselves."
'Fuck yes! Neocons get fucked! 🤣🤣'
'Even Putin knows Trump isn\'t like the rest and isn\'t like the typical trashbags that are in office. He\'s somebody much different. I believe the world also sees this and why you don\'t see as much carnage, chaos and shit going on.  It seems to be slowly taking a turn for the better, at least from what I\'m seeing. The neocons want Trump to start a war...ANYWHERE sooo bad, SO bad.  you can just see and feel it.  They are upset that he didn\'t invade Syria when he did his precision strikes.  I told everybody those strikes were meant to send a clear message.  "this is my line and don\'t you fucking DARE cross it. PEROD or I will strike harder with even MORE precision every time you go this far!"  It was to send a clear message to those other mother fuckers that want to be evil to people or that want to threaten the us or allied countries.  They will think to themselves "my god..he actually did it o.o umm...guys? you wanna rethink our strategy about threatening the united states now that he\'s in there? :O " \n\nTrump did what he needed to do in Syria. Mostly that was to send a clear message "don\'t fuck with me or push me too far", as well as beating the shit out of ISIS, which is pretty much dismantled now.  why? because their funds are totally stripped and cut off. The CIA has been figured out and they can\'t get away with it anymore.  Trump did NOT take the bait at all about "invading" a country to start a war.  will skirmishes and shit that needs to get handled happen? sure, of course they will! But he will never get us into a full blown war.  That is why our country continues to do so well.  He is focusing mostly all of his efforts on the united states. As it should be.'
"The politics and world news subreddits are going crazy right now. Literally everything they've posted in the last 2 years is about Trump and how bad he is. \n\nThey're almost short circuiting at this point. "
"THIS IS WHY TRUMP WON...THE PEOPLE DON'T CARE ABOUT RUSSIA BUT THEY DO CARE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON AT HOME."
'I think its a rather fruitless meeting. For Putin, Hillary\'s Emails aren\'t worth the harddrive they are on, he also just lost 200 troops to the US in Syria, Trump is suppressing oil price and calling out Germany for buying Russian energy, plus all the sanctions, Putin has 1001 complains but nothing to offer other than NK and limited anti-terro coordination in the middleeast. Dems talk war but what they are mad about is that Trump is making actual demand of mother Russia, no more "flexibility after election" and another free Crimea.  '
'The reason they aren\'t happy is because the Afghanistan and Iraq goldmine is going bye bye, and they need to gin up a new cold war to make themselves trillions in defense contracts. Mark my words Trump will be killed by a "Scalia Special" heart attack at some point.'
'Damn if only the media didn’t lie about him being an old crazy cook.... the man silenced everyone in a room during debates. Made both dems and reps look stupid. '
"It's kind of that simple for me...people I don't like on both sides are ripping Trump which means Trump did a good job.\n\nThe GOP establishment like Paul Ryan and the deranged left and warmongers like Clinton don't like it..\n\nPeople who want the US military to go on bombing runs everyday."
'Neocons are only happy when they are waging war and causing destruction. I used to wonder if these wars were really about oil and money, and I think I have the answer. These wars are the wish-dreams of psychopathic whack jobs. The oil and the money are just a bonus to them; their real motivations are much darker, satanic, even. \n\nWar is about power, and power is what neocons desire, above all else. The leader of Goatfuckistan is basically irrelevant to them, good bad or indifferent. \n'
"I'm starting to fear that the left might be victims of some new MKUltra program."
'What a horrible time that was, I couldn\'t stand it, I called Nancy Pelosi, I begged and screamed for her to do something - but no.   As far as I am concerned anyone who had even a glimmer of power back then has real blood on their hands.   Not only were hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed their homes, schools, hospitals, doctor\'s offices, libraries, museums, universities, the whole culture.    The neo-cons gleefully wiped out the future for every Iraq child who managed to live though their mindless carnage.  The people of Iraq spent generations holding back Iran and defending their culture and Independence future and we (no matter how much I screamed and hated it, I still have to write "we") woke up one morning and decided to smash it to smithereens.\n\nThat is way they have a deep state, to hide their ugly, ugly actions.   If we don\'t know about them, we can\'t stop them, **and the reality THEY HATE THE MOST IS - if we find out about them we can stop them, we can do that, we morons in fly-over country can take their little spy glasses away from them and sit them in the corner.**   And then who/what are they but powerless TRAITORS.\n\nI think one of the reasons they are so mad is because President Trump stiff-armed them out of his meeting.   They want to know everything that is going on so that they can hatch their plans and set their booby traps.\n\nWhen I think of neocons I can\'t help but fondly review this early internet memory:  A long time ago when the internet was still young, the smug, entitled neocon, Bill Kristol, who held a way too high opinion of himself bethought himself to be a blogger.   It was one of those precious internet moments we see illustrated here now and again - "this is how he sees himself; this is how he really is".  The abecedarian, Kristol thought to be hailed as the grue of the internet, a pedagogue, a preceptor, but our wondrous progenitors on the internet burst out laughing. (I used [Dictionary.com](https://Dictionary.com) for synonyms).\n\nAnyway, I don\'t know how long he spent under his bed but when he crawled out he condemned the whole internet as a "Seething swamp" and vowed he would never risk reality hitting him in the face ever again.'
"I'll never forget the CIA that helped my father as a young teenager in Latin America train and hunt down communist cell groups that would've spelled starvation, degeneracy, and all around disaster. \n\nIt's lost its way. \n\nWhat its become now is an utter disgrace. \n\n"
'AMEN. As soon as the reason for our invasion went from “Weapons of mass destruction” to “Making Iraq Free for Democracy” I knew that we had been duped and we were screwed! The Bushes and war mongers on both sides HATE Trump for pointing this out. He’s screwing with their “legacy”. '
'The irony is it used to be the left that hated the CIA'
"Well don't forget for a while even mainstream Republican voters defended the Iraq War to no end, not simply because of support for our boys out there (everyone should), but because they believed the Iraqi people really deserved democracy. \n\nIt was a massive mistake, regardless of how wonderful it is for the Iraqi people to vote freely. It entirely fucked and destabilized an already bloody region into total chaos. "
'I remember when GOP candidate Dr. Ron Paul was saying this at the debates (and discussing blowback) and how every other candidate (including Mr. Bomb-Bomb-Iran) attacked him for it. In case anyone missed the memo, THAT is what the rest of the GOP elites/establishment still represents. '
'But when Trump picks a woman to lead them, she’s evil because waterboarding'
'the war in Iraq was 1.8 million Iraqis killed or displaced in total i believe. All based on lies.'

Can't stop the Mueller!

The unsung hero in the Mueller investigation, Rod Rosenstein. Without this man, the investigation and this sub wouldn't exist.
To be fair, he does set a lot of records
When you're a Special Prosecutor they let you do it...
I nominate Henry Winkler to play Michael Cohen
Avenatti: "Let this serve as formal notice - there is significantly more evidence and facts to come relating to Mr. Cohen's dealings and Mr. Trump's knowledge and involvement. You can come clean now or wait to be outed. Your choice. We have only just begun...#Basta"
House conservatives are so determined to shut down the Mueller investigation that they've drafted articles of impeachment for Rod Rosenstein. But since they don't know what to charge him with, so they left that part blank. This is the behavior of dictators.
This is the face of Justice.
Congrats Trump

This deserves to go Full Streisand. At the Trump/Putin conference, Putin said he wanted Trump to win. Next... 1) the White House cut that from the transcript; Next... 2) the White House edited the video itself; Next... 3) Trump declared that Putin is pushing for Democrats and "definitely" not him.

The Trump campaign was a den of spies. So how does Trump react to news that Carter Page was one of them? "Witch Hunt Rigged, a Scam!" -- Just a few days ago, Christoper Wray (the Trump-appointed FBI Director) made it clear: the investigation is "not a witch hunt" and Mueller "is a straight shooter."
Now that Trump is again trashing NATO, let's pause to remember that the only time NATO Treaty Article 5 was ever invoked was following 9/11, when our allies stood with us. Trump is a Russian asset, and the Republican party has abandoned America.
John Oliver: The Mueller investigation is losing support among Americans (only 54% still supports it) thanks to the conservative propaganda machine. This has serious implications on the Trump impeachment, as members of congress take the opinion of their constituents into consideration.

'He could always just resign and strike a deal with Pence to pardon him. You know, like Nixon very likely did.'
'I feel like a self pardon in and of itself should be grounds for impeachment. It‚Äôs practically admitting to have committed a high crime or misdemeanor. Otherwise, why wouldn‚Äôt a President just pardon themselves for anything he/she may or may not have done (including anything as mundane as traffic tickets)?'
'The problem is that we never really settled anything with Nixon. To help the country "heal," Ford pardoned him, and ever since, the GOP has been emboldened.'
"In case anybody wants some legal precent to throw around, [here's a letter form MARY C. LAWTON, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, dated August 5, 1974](https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/presidential-or-legislative-pardon-president).  It states definitively that a president can't pardon himself.  Article II section 2 of the Constitution also states that impeachment is exempt from pardons, as well. \n"
'The thing is he will do it and it will go to the supreme court which is so right wing it will work.'
'Even if he pardoned himself he‚Äôd still get impeached and then he could be charged with a dozen of his other crimes as a private citizen. He‚Äôs committed many many crimes. '
'The good of the country comes first. '
'And I thought we defeated the nazis in WW2. Literally nothing surprises me anymore and I would just advise people (especially on the left) to relax and enjoy the fruits of their cowardly pacifism. Limit the 2A and you might as well give Trump the actual Constitution for toilet paper.'
'Hi folks. I‚Äôm Canadian and haven‚Äôt followed very closely what‚Äôs going on with Mueller‚Äôs investigation lately. I have read that it‚Äôs possibly being forced to come to an end this summer/fall. Is that true? Does it look like trump is going to get away scott free, so to speak? \n\nEdit. Why the downvotes? I just wanted some more info on the situation. There‚Äôs no reason for it to be like the_donald here where any question is seen as rhetorical and a waste of time to answer. '
'I would tend to agree. To date there is no evidence the president has committed any crimes.  \n\n\nHowever; the presidents power to pardon is in the constitution. '
"You girls most definitely do not get Trumps humor. It's hilarious, to me, Donald, and many others :D"
'But he said he did not need to because he is innocent did you even read the tweet'
'"Hey DOJ, can the president pardon himself? Asking for a friend."'
"Actually, pardoning witnesses wouldn't help him much because it'd protect them from self incrimination, thus fifth amendment rights could no longer be used to keep secrets from a court."
'Nixon tried pardoning people involved in his case. It‚Äôs one of the reasons he was impeached...'
'Nixon was pardoned by Gerald Ford \n\nHe didn‚Äôt need to pardon himself, his VP did '
"FWIW, Nixon's original VP, Spiro Agnew - resigned (10/9/1973). Nixon appointed Ford under the 25th amendment [section 2] (nominated 10/12/1973, confirmed 12/6/1973), and it was then Ford who pardoned him (9/8/1974) about a month after Nixon's resignation (8/9/1974)\n\n\nHonestly, I'd be more worried of this type of situation. Where Pence leaves the picture, and Trump can appoint whomever he wants (pending confirmation, but with R's you never know...) and that person could be someone more 'loyal' to pardon Trump himself"
"Pence can't pardon state criminal charges."
'A pardon for what?'
"So now the President's supporters are defending his actions by saying he was just joking. Geez, we've really sunk low"
'A pardon for what?'
'Who is "Y\'all"? Your image of one tweet from some random news site isn\'t evidence that anyone here or anyone in significant numbers was calling for a Clinton self-pardon. Your post is the first time I ever even heard it mentioned.'
'Core question.\n\nWhy does an innocent man feel the need to talk about self-pardon at all? \n\nWhy tweet it? No one asked him how big his pardon was. '
'I know it‚Äôs wrong but I wish his base could be held accountable in some way'
"The idea behind not letting a President be indicted is that indictment only requires a prosecutor and a grand jury, whereas impeachment (in theory) reflects the will of the people. If a tough prosecutor wants to disrupt the President's ability to do his job, he can, if the President is indictable. Of course, that theory depends on the belief that Congress, as you said, would take their job seriously."
'That\'s a good point. I think though that SCOTUS will not expand the powers of the Executive Branch and allowing Trump "unfettered" pardon powers and the reason you gave would be just one of many.\n\nI do not think that Donald Trump has ever even read the Constitution.'
'Dude learn to read he asked of he could pardon himself.'

'> Sessions testified before Congress in November 2017 that he ‚Äúpushed back‚Äù against the proposal made by former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos at a March 31, 2016 campaign meeting. Then a senator from Alabama, Sessions chaired the meeting as head of the Trump campaign‚Äôs foreign policy team.\n\n> ‚ÄúYes, I pushed back,‚Äù Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee on Nov. 14, when asked whether he shut down Papadopoulos‚Äô proposed outreach to Russia.\n\n> Sessions has since also been q meeting told Reuters they gave their version of events to FBI agents or congressional investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 election. Although the accounts they provided to Reuters differed in certain respects, all three, who declined to be identified, said Sessions had expressed no objections to Papadopoulos‚Äô idea.\n\n'

'Completely out of the loop and can\'t really understand what the issue is here. I can clearly hear Putin say in russian - before being interrupted by the translator voice-over - saying "Yes, I would have wanted him to win". I didnt hear him say "Yes, I did. Yes, I did". It looks like the question was translated to russian wrong and his reaponse also translated from russian wrong. Or am i missing somethi here?\n\nEDIT: just watched the russian side of the question. The question was translated as "mr president, did you want Trump to win the election and did you direct --" thats where the question is cut off by the translator. Putin removes his earpiece even before the translator stops (more than likely does not even hear the beginning of the second part) and he replies "yes, i would have wanted him to win because he wanted to normalize relationships between our countries".'

"That actually is correct. What they miss is that Mueller could simply refer the evidence to the proper US Attorney office. Mueller has a very specific scope for his investigation. I believe his prosecution of Manafort is within that scope, but to claim otherwise is not a ludicrous argument because we don't have enough publicly-available information to make that determination."
'That\'s not really the Manafort argument, though. Mueller is called a "Special" Counsel for a reason: his office exists for a special purpose. If he finds evidence of crimes that fall out of his mandate, it\'s his responsibility to refer that evidence to the proper US Attorney, as he did in Michael Cohen\'s case. Your hypothetical doesn\'t really work because it deals with ordinary crimes which would be prosecuted by an ordinary prosecutorial office, meaning they can bring one charge as easily as another (assuming they have the evidence, obviously).

The best case scenario at that point is Civil War II, with the left and right dividing up any "non-partisan" agencies in what will undoubtedly be the end of the US as a global power. We\'ll be lucky if we come out of it as strong as Russia.'

"The only thing that makes me feel better about this, is that no matter how bad things get under trump, we *will* replace him eventually (whether it's in the next election or he somehow ends up making it 2 terms) and hopefully go back to a state of normalcy. The chance of him somehow becoming an *actual* dictator seems to be almost zero. People are putting up with him as much as they are because they know he'll be gone soon. "
'Well if you‚Äôll recall the GOP actually voted to release it. This is the Cheeto man all on his own. '

'I think he\'s pushing them/back and doubling down on "can a president obstruct justice" and "can you indict a sitting president". The man is fully intent in causing a constitutional crisis to keep his position of power because the thought of not being able to repay debts likely leads to death. Forcing the answers to those questions to be formalized is the constitutional crisis. For those un-aware a constitutional crisis just means we have to admit out constitution missed something and we have to amend it. It\'s a crisis because nobody has a set of rules to following. This has happened regularly in American History. 27 times but actually 17 times after the orig bill of rights (10). Fun fact, I just did some rough numbers and it happens every 11 years on average. I noticed if there\'s one then there\'s another within 2-3 years. Not exact science but kind of fun to look at from an "evolution over time" point of view.

'Actual question, it‚Äôs going to sound trollish but I‚Äôm honestly curious and looking for an answer. According to a few different news stories the wording for Hillary‚Äôs case was changed so congress wouldn‚Äôt prosecute her for legal wrong doing. (I‚Äôm not even going to try and take a stance on if she‚Äôs guilty or not. Everyone knows it‚Äôs a heated topic and I peronsally have not researched enough to personally feel confident debating it.)

As a result their ‚Äústudy‚Äù doesn‚Äôt take into account the effects of socio-economic standing on education outcome. But they‚Äôve convinced all these lower-middle class, blue collar types that could never afford private education that private education is the superior option and the only thing keeping them from being able to put their kids into a private school is the couple hundred dollars from their income taxes that are allocated to education funding. So they vote for the party that wants to cut taxes. Ignoring the fact that the taxes being cut aren‚Äôt their taxes because they‚Äôre already in the lowest possible tax bracket.

'You all are right about him, IMO. You are wrong about who or what he is primarily investigating. He is investigating Uranium One. This is within the scope of his orders, since Manafort was involved in both the "Russian interference in the election," and in Uranium One. Uranium One even provides the only motive for Russia to interfere on Trump\'s behalf. If Putin, et. al. can bribe Clinton so easily, nominally a plus for Russia, who else can easily control her? A Clinton win would have placed American foreign policy up for sale to the highest bidder, as proven by Uranium One, so it would have been irresponsible for Russia not to clandestinely sabotage her campaign and/or prop up Trump\'s. An unpredictable America is bad for Russia. If Russia interfered, thanks! Don\'t do it again, arrest all involved if true.'

"These articles are the reason he won *and* the reason he's going to win again. I've been watching & listening for over a year. Every 'scandal' is a theory, a suspicion, a nasty joke or simply a wild projection. It's hysteria. You'd all be better served organizing all of this and keeping it quiet until you actually have something real to say. \n\nThese tactics used to work very well. Generally known as an October surprise. (October surprise is a news event deliberately created or timed or sometimes occurring spontaneously to influence the outcome of an election.) The event created doubt about the candidate. After the election, the story would go away. (Remember the recent Gloria Allred mess with the yearbook with the hilariously forged signature that included his assistant's initials?) \n\nAny road, the people who actually decide the elections are the 'undecided' people. Ironic that the people who break the 'tie' are the least informed, right? In the age of fingertip information, TV & newspapers have much less power to influence these voters. It takes almost no effort to do a little research on your own. Plus, it's been widely reported for years how dishonest main stream media can be. That said, the October surprise doesn't work anymore. Used to be calling someone a 'racist' was the coup de gr√¢ce for anyone. It's impossible to defend. Now the word of the day is 'pedophile.' People see through it now. That why the left is not in power. "

"Well when you're hired for an important international position if you don't have access to the information your job is about you can't do it.

I seem to remember someone running \t a presidential campaign on handling of classified material and a refrain about jail that related said handling. (That's Trump and *Lock her up!*). Now everyone is sticking the knife in about how the calligrapher has a higher clearance than Jared, forgetting it seems, that the damage is done. It's unreal that this even happened. Corrupt, unqualified son-in-law has access to the highest levels of US intelligence for over a year and when he finally loses the access he *should never have had and only gained through nepotism)* everyone treats it like a win. You're kidding yourselves."

'The way Trump uses his ties are a form of body language called "crotch display" that has a variety of ways to be expressed. Another one (not used by Trump) is hooking the thumb of each hand into the front jeans pocket, and the hands kind of frame the crotch. "I\'m dominant, look at my crotch!".'

This whole thing is starting to feel like an elaborate charade meant to satiate the general public‚Äôs growing mistrust of the government at large, and to minimize the perceived scope and magnitude of government corruption in the public eye by providing us an easy target to direct all our anger and frustration at.\n\nIf the general public had spent the last 11 months reading/thinking/talking about election reform, gerrymandering, the electoral college, socializing healthcare/higher education, tax reform, ways to de-escalate war in the Middle East, etc. instead of squandering our precious mental energy raging over Trump‚Äôs blatant lack of integrity as we intently study every new tidbit of obscure and un-actionable intel to arise from this investigation, we‚Äôd be 11 months closer to actually bringing about the positive change we‚Äôre all so desperate for. Alas, the MSM is dead-set on making sure we read/think/talk about Donald Trump as much as possible, and all our other hopes/desires for the future are effectively shelved as a consequence.\n\nAnyways, is it really necessary for us to wait out this investigation before we seek impeachment? Potential collusion aside, Trump has already demonstrated his incompetence and lack of integrity a hundred times over. The way things are going now, Trump‚Äôs 4-year term will be over by the time the FBI has collected enough actionable intelligence to lock him up.\n\n\n'
"What's happening now is an existential threat to our democracy, but it doesn't become a constitutional crisis until it's a crisis the consitution can't resolve.

Because I supported universal heathcare,  and more appropriate taxing ; even though she knows I\'ve worked for everything in my life.\n\nWe can\'t have a proper discussion in politics anymore because it\'s never a discussion it\'s just her spouting of some misinformed bit of information and not wanting anything to contest it. Lately it\'s been about how I want this country to be socialist. Which is not true and when I try to explain to her that no; I infact don\'t want to be a socialist country I just want to adopt more of their ideals she talks about other countries that are socialist( dictatorships) and refuses to listen to me. \n\nShe\'s also started hardcore bagging on Obama and his administration going so far as to say that Michelle was a transgender person (not her words) and that he was what ruined this country 100% no one else (that was Republican) did anything wrong.\n\nFinally the one thing that has completely put me off with her was the "Grab \'am by the pussy" scandal.

Remember this whole caper was used to spin the story after the White House ignored Sally Yates‚Äô warning to McGahn about Flynn‚Äôs exposure to blackmail (this blackmail concern was raised when Flynn‚Äôs public statements were contradicted by surveillance gathered by the IC during routine taps of the Russian embassy. In the communications transmitted from the Russian embassy, Flynn‚Äôs identity was unmasked, this is what led to Nunes‚Äô information laundering that got him temporarily recused.)\n\nFlynn was directed by a very senior member of the transition, reportedly Kushner, to notify Russia of the Trump administration‚Äôs imminent turnabout with regard to sanctions (economic ostracism for human rights violations and illegal warfare and cyber/information warfare).\n\nIt is also very likely that Pence was aware of the Kremlin‚Äôs veto of Romney for Sec. of State, and if so, was definitely consulted about the switch to Tillerson under this foreign influence campaign.\n\nIt‚Äôs very unlikely that Pence was oblivious to all of this, though he may be.

Congress is the only agency that can do anything to the President.  And the GOP is NOT going to do anything.  So tell me what will happen.  Please."
'If you want to read the special investigators orders from Rosenstein, they are public record and readily available.  And it differs some from what Comey is investigating.  Comey was investigating Russian intervention into our election, which has been proven, and he was seeing if the Trump campaign acted to collude with the Russians in that endeavor.  When Trump fired Comey, he brought Mueller upon himself with a much broader scope as defined by the deputy AG.  Now Mueller isn‚Äôt just investigating possible collusion between the Russians and Trump, he‚Äôs also investigating the potential of obstruction of justice by the president for firing the FBI director.  \n\nCollusion would be hard to prove, and Trump may not have colluded with the Russians.  But if he did act to obstruct justice by firing Comey, that is much different and regardless of any connections to the Russians, is an impeachable offense. See Clinton and Nixon.  The crime they committed wasn‚Äôt that bad, it was the coverup that made it worse.  \n\nBack to the point about the special council, he has the authority to look anywhere he damn well pleases.  Something Comey didn‚Äôt really have.  So if Mueller uncovers things pertaining to money laundering, he can also bring charges against those with evidence that points to them laundering money for the Russians.  So if Trump was laundering money, no one knows what to do.  We aren‚Äôt sure if we can indict a sitting president for crimes that happened before he took office.  \n\nSo to recap.  Trump could have A. Collided with the Russians to win an election B. Obstructed justice by firing Comey or C. Laundered money for the Russians \n\nThe specific one and evidence that proves guilt or innocence is held secret as it is an ongoing investigation, so you, like us will have to tune in later to find out.

His lawyers have made an admirable effort to keep him from explicitly breaking the law, despite his best efforts. Remember, this sub can be as circle-jerky as any other, so people often jump the gun here. When Mueller inevitably sits down with him, one of 4 things will happen:\n- Trump tries (and succeeds, despite the best efforts of his legal counsel) to preempt the interview by firing Mueller and gutting the FBI. Because obstruction of justice is a crime of intent, there will be a pretty concrete case for OoJ.\n- Trump can‚Äôt get his story straight during the interview and gets impeached for lying under oath.\n- Trump cooperates fully and turns out to have colluded with Russian espionage people, or to have promised to let sanctions lapse in exchange for Kompromat on Hillary.\n- Trump cooperates fully and turns out to just be a clueless old man who accidentally hired a bunch of known Russian intelligence assets as campaign staff and advisors in the White House.\n\n2.

Comey was only fired because he was pursuing a BS investigation that began under Obama. So essentially, this investigation isn't one that was started by R's. They are just continuing it because they kinda have to at this point but there is no way that Rosenstein or Sessions would've started an investigation like this.**\n\nOkay, please help me with a good response to this.

The hypocrisy is unreal. I would suggest you try thinking for yourself, but you might get an aneurysm. \n\nLol Drumpf raped like 11 women amiright?

'I agree. This meme is counterproductive. '
"I mean, she couldn't have actually done anything. The most she could have done was recommend to Obama that he send troops."
'Came here to say this lol. I wonder what happens if you write to that address now....'
'So you agree trump has committed crimes?'
"No, not her actions. I'm talking about her response to the endless Benghazi investigations. Her and the entire Democratic Party basically thought they were a sham and very vocal about it"
'I agree in most cases, but I said it depends on the circumstances for a reason. Witch hunts do happen. Like Hillary being investigated so many times for Benghazi was clearly a witch hunt.'
'So it has to be a tweet, not a complaint, only a tweet. Curious standard. '
"It's a wonderful day in the Muellerhood"
'It is amazing how such a simple moral principle expressed concisely can be so powerful.  I think that while the message he was trying to get across was for kids looking for guidance, it is also for adults trying to figure out what to do in times of crisis: Be the person who helps.'

"So it's ok to vote for the other 225. Got it."
"My dad thinks that many Republicans are single-issue voters, and that that issue is abortion.

"We aren't fighting with them, we are negotiating with them.  Trump has put them on notice that the US will no longer be taken advantage of, no different than a parent telling an adult kid, that's it, we aren't paying for your car and cell phone anymore.   We aren't going to suffer with bad trade deals any more, and we aren't going to suffer with NATO members not paying their fair share.  That isn't fighting, that's tough love."
'What do you call someone who alienates your friends and consorts with your enemies?'
"It's so baffling how many Republicans in the public sphere and that I know personally that invoke Reagan all the time but never consider how at\\-odds he would be with Trump.\n\nAlienating our closest allies, a super nationalistic and anti\\-free trade platform, all while bending over backwards to the sham democracy Russia led by strong\\-man Putin.

Already certain mechanisms have been set in place to deal with this circumstance. (The FBI could indict a ham sandwich, it doesn't mean anything.) An indictment is merely an allegation, not proof or evidence. The anti-Trump agenda will parade it as proof of wrongdoing without due process. This will hurt our economy and the stock market will hurt  but it (the story) will never gain traction. Mueller and his entire team will be exposed as compromised and therefore disbanded & investigated. The people will win. The swamp will be drained. The 2016 election will not be undermined. The will of the people will prevail. To the best of my knowledge, this isn't opinion. "

You don\'t need to "study" it, it\'s pretty clear if you understand basic civics: evidence is presented to a grand jury, they decide a crime has likely been committed and vote to indict, charges are formally prepared and filed, and a case goes to trial. \n\nIt\'s not proof of wrongdoing, that\'s a determination made at trial. But it does show a supermajority of grand jurors believes that there is preponderance of evidence of guilt based on what they\'ve been presented. No prosecutor brings a case they think they\'re going to lose, and you\'d better believe that with a case this high-profile that they\'re building an air-tight case.\n\nYou can believe whatever you want to, but reality is what it is despite your opinion.'

"Well, we do have the supreme court if a subpoena is being ignored, they could hold him in contempt (I think, not a lawyer) but as everyone keeps saying, a lot of this is speculative as it's never been so bad that it needed testing. According to my high school constitution classes, there are three branches of government that check and balance each other and the supreme court would be on equal footing. Even though it's tilted to republicans, I still have faith that they would not allow our democracy to be completely destroyed because of partisan bullshit. I don't even think Gorsuch is enough of a Trump puppet to let that cast it's own vote. These people already serve for life, they have nothing to fear except from their own conscience. The only problem is the supreme court has no way to actually enforce their own rulings, and would rely on congress to impeach. You would certainly be signing your own career death warrant if the president was convicted of high crimes/misdemeanors by the SUPREME COURT then you decided not to impeach.    \n    \nI honestly think people are taking the speculation a bit too far on this one however. Why hasn't congress impeached him? There is an investigation underway. Even the dems won't fight for impeachment yet because they know it's not time. You only go for it when you have all your ducks in a row, and the process is underway to find out exactly where those ducks are."
"That's interesting. I was not aware that a US Marshall had that sort of legal authority on the President.  That authority may exist in theory but I would be surprised if they could pull it off without his cooperation.  Is the Secret Service really going to let the President be placed into custody for this purpose?"
"What you're talking about is arresting a sitting President.  There is much debate about that however he cannot be arrested unless he is impeached and removed from office (thus becoming an ordinary citizen).

They also keep saying "about" collection is still used, when it is not.

'Not necessarily.  In a perfect world scenario it‚Äôs possible for FBI directors to have issues that prevent them from properly doing their jobs.  But I do not think it applies here.  There is evidence that Trump just didn‚Äôt want anyone investigating him, his family, or the campaign.  For the inept FBI director idea to be valid there would have to be proof that Comey and Mueller were not doing their jobs well.  If that evidence existed it would be public news.  \n\nAt best all Fox can do is misdirect, lie, and not present actual evidence.  This is why the nothing burger claims simply do not pan out.

'I doubt that - if the republicans haven\'t brought articles of impeachment yet they\'re not going to. Donald drumpft is a traitor, Paul Ryan is a traitor, Mitch McConnell is a traitor, Jeff Sessions is a traitor - and Putin is their boss. They will continue to serve Putin until democrats are back in power because the entire republican party is complicit. They know what\'s going on but won\'t say it because "that\'s how we know we\'re family here, no leaks" ~ Paul Ryan. They\'re letting Russia dictate US policy, they\'re ignoring the president\'s numerous scandals that prove he is unfit for office, they\'re playing politics to protect a president who is actively engaged in a campaign to strengthen Russian influence in the US and undermine US interests.

"I think that's kind of fatalistic. I'm 99% sure there's a breaking point for most Trump supporters and it's only a question of where that breaking point is. For some, a criminal conviction of someone at the top may be enough to flip them, for example. \n\nSome are just Russian trolls posing as Trump supporters, so those ones will never change their minds unless they get marching orders that it's time to pretend like their minds have changed for some tactical reason.\n\nI think very few are so far gone that they would be able to ignore criminal indictments, if such indictments end up going all the way to the top. Right now, we have an ongoing investigation and even though there is a lot of substance out there, it's not necessarily substance that is easy to digest or understand in its entirety.

'Nobody‚Äôs forcing you to stick your head in the sand and pretend the president is a pinnacle of mental health and a strong proponent of equal rights. That‚Äôs on you.

"You keep using British references (The Guardian and the OED) to support your point.  Like I mentioned before, I am strictly talking about the US definitions.\n\nInternational Radio Journalism - Page 156 - Google Books Result\nhttps://books.google.com/books?isbn=1134863004\n\n>***Jail, prison The Americans make a distinction between jail and prison. In Britain the words are interchangeable.*** \n\nThe linked page provides much more clarification.  It provides much better definitions of the actual differences between jail and prison than what I've provided.  They do, however, match what I said before.  \n\nJails are local facilities for holding for trial, short sentences (usually local or state violations), primarily misdemeanours but felons awaiting trial are mixed in.  Jails generally do not have separate facilities for high security/medium security prisoners.  That is generally handled in-house through segregation.\n\nPrison is synonymous with penitentiary.  These are post-sentencing facilities that are generally defined by their security level.  However, some prisons will include multiple security levels but held in separate facilities on the compound."

"You realize their is a whole contingency of establishment republicans who would love nothing more than to see Trump lose his office? Mueller being a republican matters about as much to me, a Trump voter and registered independent, as what Miley Cyrus had for breakfast... which is to say not at all.\n\nI'll base my opinions on the facts. The fact that his team is comprised of people with CLEAR conflicts of interest. The Mueller investigation is a direct result of the Clinton email cover up. Corrupt elements at the top of the FBI and members of Obama's cabinet risked exposure if Trump took office unimpeded. The Mueller investigation will find nothing because their is no evidence of Russia's impact in our election at all. And empty headed water carriers of an establishment on the way out will be crying when we finally get justice for the crimes of the last three decades of political corruption."

"**Tea Act**\n\nTea Act 1773 (13 Geo 3 c 44) was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain. The principal objective was to reduce the massive amount of tea held by the financially troubled British East India Company in its London warehouses and to help the financially struggling company survive. A related objective was to undercut the price of illegal tea, smuggled into Britain's North American colonies. This was supposed to convince the colonists to purchase Company tea on which the Townshend duties were paid, thus implicitly agreeing to accept Parliament's right of taxation.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28"

'The one person who has the highest batting percentage in all of this is the Fraude Taylor account (@Fraud_1), and they mostly prove how often the "inside scoopers" known as "teamPatriot, are normally wrong, or how far off the rails they\'ve gone (a la Louise Mensch, who has no credibility at this point). Teapain correctly called the Flynn indictment, so I\'m inclined to believe that TeaPain is a person/group of persons who *might* be able to see indicators in something happening. Then there\'s Rick Wilson, whose a talking head on the networks and has worked with legitimate republican candidates as a strategist, and I don\'t think he\'d go along with the crazytrain on twitter and might legitimately have good sources on his own. Pretty much, take the speculation as a grain of salt, and don\'t dwell on things WAY too much. For me, this all serves as it\'s own form of entertainment, but I\'m not clinging to it.'

"The Russian message was not simply to divide. The IRA wasn't some 50/50 'lets make pro Hilary and pro trump' memes. They made a ton of attacks on all kinds of groups, sometimes to stoke racial strife, sometimes to split common alliances among Americans. Putin absolutely hates Clinton. Clinton did not look on Putin's kleptocracy very kindly, and stated multiple times that Russian elections were shambolics of the highest order. Putin thought those statements by Clinton were alone enough to lob accusations of interference by Americans in the last Russian elections. Of course Putin likes having a stooge that has never and likely will never speak an ill word of him or his regime. What makes you think a greedy scumbag like Putin would spend millions of dollars for nothing in return? What makes you think a narcissistic blow hard like Trump only holds back on the one person he's suspected of having an illicit relationship with? Let me also add that it is suspected that Russia also infiltrated the RNC but never released info or leaks. Does that really sound like a plan to 'simply divide'? Let's not also forget that when Trump was elected, the IRA members were all patting themselves on the back."

Vekselberg donated to the Trump\'s inaugural fund, which was a slush fund with about $60 million dollars that disappeard, unaccounted for. Vekselberg attended Trump\'s inauguration and also put money into Cohen\'s "Bribes Here" LLC *while Trump was president*.  \n  \nAnd you think the above with Trump is the same as $50,000 to a legit charity, spent on fighting AIDS or building houses in Haiti?  \n  \n"Both sides"'

All indications are, there's a ton of evidence and leads to follow up on. The indictments and plea deals so far are to show to others involved not to lie to Mueller, and that Mueller is serious. Those who got a sweet plea deal had to have something juicy for Mueller.  \n  \nMy big question is will Mueller be far enough along to drop the hammer well before (~2 months) the midterm elections, or will it be after?"

Kudos to the person who blew the whistle on this.  I would not be surprised if they lost their job over their act of bravery.\n\nThis is what makes things like this (and much, much worse) possible with zero repercussions to the officers involved, as well as the lack of a separate prosecutorial office who\'s job is to charge agents of law enforcement when they commit crimes, either within or without the bounds of their duty as LEOs.  The problem is that police officers work so closely with other agents of the justice system (DAs, judges), that it is almost impossible to convict an officer of virtually anything but the most heinous crimes, because everyone involved has to work with the people and comrades of those they\'re prosecuting on a day-to-day basis.  Most PDs have an internal affairs department for this very reason.  Why should that thought process not extend to the prosecutorial, and even judicial levels; at least in big cities, where the extra expense would be much less impactful to criminal justice budgets?'

If they lie, cheat, and defraud the people, the people have a right to call a spade, a spade and choose a new leader. One that doesn't have to rely on Russian money, or to lie to the people they're supposed to lead, one that doesn't use the office of the presidency to enrichen himself.\n\nRepublicans did this to themselves."

Where do they do the polling? Is it done in every state? Certain areas lean left while others lean right, how do we know the sample groups are taken from the same amount of people from each side. Are they getting them from rural areas or cities or both. The only way I can see a poll being a usable piece of data is if it is done by popular vote. Even then some people don't vote regularly or even at all (imo, they can't complain b/c they didn't give input).  A sample size of 50percent left 50 percent right, won't give an accurate representation of the populace as a whole. I'm not trying to be cynical but how does it work!"

"This is actually rather impressive due to much more massive this investigation is compared to the other SC investigations. Add this to the fact that we still know little about the CI investigation and even with the Russian 13 indictment we still have no idea what several prosecutors on Team Mueller are doing it's only getting bigger. "
"But, I just want to point out i give mueller and his team huge props and thanks from an average dude for this, will anything really..happen? \n\nAll seats of power in our country, from the judges, to the congress are ALL GoP And there's no way they would impeach, or do anything to trump. "

However, I am skeptical of books written by high profile pictures who would profit from juicy material.

I.e. illegally gotten information.  \n\nThat‚Äôs the difference, and it‚Äôs not really splitting hairs either.  One was legally obtained, the other not legally obtained.  \n\nSame with Nixon.

Whereas accepting any form of contribution from a foreign country, money or not, is not legal.  \n\nAnd this is where I don‚Äôt understand how it works with the Steele research and how that‚Äôs legal.

"I'd support ending it. I don't think anyone should have that kind of power without having to go through the courts."
'Pretty much all presidential pardons are miscarriages of justice. That‚Äôs the point. It‚Äôs done specifically to say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre guilty but you get to go free‚Äù. It‚Äôs not like a pardon from the governor, which can save a death row inmate before the switch wrongly gets flipped. It‚Äôs almost always for political or publicity purposes. \n\nTrump is trying to set it up so he can pardon himself. That‚Äôs an entirely different thing than anything any governor does or president tries to do. Governor pardons can often save innocent lives from being wrongly taken. Those pardons absolutely should be preserved. This is different. This is not normal. It‚Äôs different from every other pardon ever.'
'What if the courts got it wrong? Should a governor not be able to stay a looming execution in light of unquestionable exculpatory evidence when going through the courts would not be expedient enough to save an innocent life? '
"I'm not sure if he's setting up to pardon himself as much as he's trying to signal to anyone considering flipping on him that if they stick it out and don't cooperate with the probe instead he'll pardon *them*."

These people have almost no skill in technology, let alone the tool to distinguish good journalism and borderline propaganda, and even smart people can easily duped by propaganda."

It was wrong to let Clinton off the hook when she broke the law by mishandling classified materials, and it's wrong to let Trump or his associates off the hook for crimes they are likely to have committed.\n\nLetting powerful people off the hook is what corrupt countries do.\n\nMore important than any of those issues is this: I want Trump to be removed from office and don't really care how it's done. Right now, the Mueller investing seems like our best hope of doing that. If it's not, then Americans should look for alternative approaches, like congressional investigations, impeachment, or the 25th Amendment.\n\nPresident Trump presents a genuinely threat to our institutions and I'm okay with any means it takes to get him out and replaced with Pence."

'[Russia invaded and annexed Crimea in 2014.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation)\n\nIf true, this is big.\n\n'
'So the head of the SVR, Russia‚Äôs equivalent of the CIA, who is banned from entering the US, was allowed to come here and enter the country, along with the heads of the GRU and the FSB, the agencies responsible for meddling in our 2016 elections, to have a secret meeting with Trump appointed CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Trump appointed National Intelligence Director Dan Coats and others unnamed. And then, the Trump administration decides not to enforce Russian sanctions voted nearly unanimously to go into effect by congress. Coincidence? Kompromat?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4RIeL5VEGlw'
'Well, guys, we had a nice run, but America is done. Pack it up.'
'I wouldn\'t assume anything nefarious with Pompeo or Coats until proven otherwise.\n\nThey were doing their job. Trump is their boss. If he says "I\'m allowing these foreign diplomats into the country and want you to meet with them", that\'s what they do. I know Pompeo is a Trump ally, but Coats pushed hard to punish Russia over the annexation of Crimea. By many accounts, Coats was a Pence pick. Now, that may mean he\'s a hardcore Republican, but I don\'t think its fair to assume that he is involved based on what we know today.\n\nPart of Russia\'s plan is to undermine the public\'s faith in our institutions like the CIA and FBI. Lets not let them win by making blanket statements like this with no proof of their involvement in Trump\'s decision to forgo enforcing the sanctions. We know Trump and many of his closest allies are implicated, lets not start assuming everyone in the government or everyone with any ancillary connection to Trump is compromised. Russia wins when we do that.'

Let‚Äôs not shoot the messengers just yet. This meeting could have been about a lot of things unrelated to Russian election interference. But it‚Äôs highly unusual in the senior rank of the attendees and the organizations they represent, as well as the timing and the fact that they met wasn‚Äôt made public by the US government. However, we found out about it only after the Kremlin bragged about it to Russian Media, plus letting the head of the SVR onto the very US soil from which he is banned, had to be green lit by someone in the Trump Administration, and the timing with the decision by Trump not to enforce sanctions, makes the whole thing smell a little like man trough.'

Build a case? There was no good reason for Russia to want Trump in office. They don\'t give a crap. If anything Russian would want Hillary since her and Bill and have already been making deals with them. Mueller investigation has gone on for a year now and there\'s zero evidence of collusion.

'Why? Even with photographic evidence trump supporters will claim "Just because he\'s at the table that doesn\'t mean trump knows him." Cause we all have random strangers in our dining room table or invite people who have nothing to do with my finances to just come on in and sit with me while I do my taxes. trump logic.'
"Actually you got a good point on line 0-3, gonna keep that in mind.\n\nI'm still convinced with my theory, that mueller already got enough evidence to throw orange tidepod (honestly) into jail but he's holding back because he wants to come forward with ALL the evidence,including ppl around him."
"The problem is that Mueller can't bring Trump to trial. The only charge that can be brought against a sitting president is impeachment, and that's done through congress, not the judicial system.\n\nI think Mueller is actually quite deliberate and intelligent in this: He's building a huge, undeniable case against Trump, with charges/convictions all around Trump, so that the house/senate will be compelled to impeach Trump. Remember, this is the only way any charges can be brought against Trump.\n\nSo yeah, Mueller will never be able to charge Trump with any crimes. Instead, he's setting it up so he won't *need* to charge Trump with any crimes."
'The best tactic I heard was to come up with a slightly more radical version of the theory and then accuse *them* of being shills trying to hide the truth.'
'I wanted to share this elsewhere, but figured it was worth verifying before doing so. Quote verified authentic. Here you go: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/theodore-roosevelt-on-criticizing-the-president/'
'Just F Your I, TR really didn\'t like anyone outside his family calling him "Teddy", he preferred "Theodore" from most people.\n\nOr Colonel.'
"Nice one, speaking of links, he's a pretty shitty golfer. "
"I think I get what you're trying to say.  Trump is the most criticized President in recent history or that Obama can't be criticized for some reason (possibly due to being a minority without appearing racist?).  However that's a bit of a short sighted position to take since we can still criticize anyone without threat of attack or imprisonment.\n\nBut I'm pretty sure Theodore Roosevelt applied this to all presidents to include himself.  I don't think any other president would this be more fitting towards than a President Trump who [can't handle criticism](http://www.azfamily.com/story/37286991/jeff-flake-rips-trump-a-president-who-cannot-take-criticism-is-charting-a-very-dangerous-path) (as noted by his peer).  This is common knowledge.  I shouldn't need to, nor do I want to, point out all the numerous tweets from Trump himself which supports this.  Trump simply does not take critics nor criticism well at all.  \n\nWhile this isn't necessarily an unpatriotic, servile, and morally treasonable trait by itself.  But then again, Trump is the kind of President who would [ask for loyalty oaths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FCKG1-1__M).  Not to mention the numerous, and frankly credible, accusations of demanding similar from those around him.  \n\nLike Teddy Roosevelt more or less says, this is categorically un-American.  This combined with his [threats and attacks to critics](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/11/23/ten-ways-to-tell-if-your-president-is-a-dictator/) (even threatening imprisonment) embodies precisely what Teddy has alluded to.  \n\nEven worse, while he demands loyalty from the public, he holds himself above the public by opting out of military service during the Vietnam War.  \n\nBut really this post is more of a criticism of T_D which bans any criticism of President Trump."

FBI CANNOT (after all of this time) VERIFY CLAIMS IN DOSSIER OF RUSSIA/TRUMP COLLUSION.

'It makes me kind of smile that he spent his xmas thinking about how many people are working hard against him. '

'Frlends\n\nPeople that give you money in exchange for political favors'
"It's not just laziness, sometimes Twitter doesn't work well in some Reddit apps. So I appreciate your work."
'GOOD point'
'Good analysis. In the end it is a follow the money exercise. Mueller got the goods when Flynn flipped and now he is on the money trail. '
"It's called an investigation.  Mueller is investigatin'.\n\nSometimes investigations take a long time.  It took Ken Starr 6 years to investigate Bill Clinton, and it cost $120M (in today's dollars).\n\nMueller, with four indictments within 9 months, is providing good bang for buck."
"You don't half-ass accusations at that level, even family lawyers put in his position wouldn't even think of rushing this.\n\nHowever, if he is stalling, which is unlikely, it would most likely be because many congressmen and senators are involved, and Trump would likely be protected by them because they don't want anybody checking their closets for skeletons either.\n\nImpeachment is not a sure thing at this time, and why leave it up to people who are also likely being blackmailed to support Trump just as Trump is likely being blackmailed by Putin."

"I think you're undervaluing the value of the skills Bill and Obama had as politicians. Being President requires people to get people to support things they do not understand all the time. Obamacare helped a ton of people but is unpopular because few if any people understand the intricacies of how health insurance works, and can;t be reasonably expected to learn it all that well."

'Please explain why Pelosi should be speaker of the house when Democrats take it back later this year.'
"Gabbard is widely despised by most liberals because she's unwilling to just fall in line. She's a disrupter which is what the party desperately needs. The Republicans have a disrupter. She would be a perfect match for Donald Trump and someone younger democrats (the future of the Democratic Party) can relate to."
'This was an *actual* conspiracy theory during the Republican primaries (speculation: probably started by CA and Cruz, but who knows if this was a way to drum up support for him) - at least, in that all with those pics of him with the Clintons, and their donation money, that *maybe* he was trying to sneak in as a RINO Democrat.... ya know, since he used to be a Democrat.'
"where is collusion between anyone supporting either candidate? this is what you wanted for an answer; because we should deal with Russians' through Clinton's uranium deal? Because we all earn that paycheck right? "

'Still too smart for Trump. '
'They were also brilliant in their field, which makes them nothing like the Trump legal clown car.'
'Honestly i‚Äôve never seen the man speak (got into politics during 2015, didn‚Äôt find out about the man until he took over the investigation) so i‚Äôll give it a watch. '
'The patriot act explanation is really good.  '
"it's telling that you have to go back 9years to get anything remotely interesting from that guy. Maybe theres no recent pics of him because he's wearing one of those popular ankle boots Hillary and McCain wear all the time now. "
'How you could watch the video and then post your comment speaks volumes to your lack of comprehension.  Truly impressive. '
'Tbf, Russia had never cyber attacked the US ~~before~~ recently, whereas China has. '
'9/11 caused our society to value security over privacy.  He explained that the intelligence side of the fbi and the criminal side of the fbi couldn‚Äôt share information with eachother before 9/11. The patriot act changed that, and it‚Äôs one of the best weapons we have to fight against terror. '
"While true, in 2015 everyone was talking about the Chinese hackers. So why wouldn't he be more concerned about recent hacks rather than ones not quite so much in the news. Keep in mind he hadn't been in the FBI for a few years so he didn't have access to confidential intel, only the news."
'Every major journalist outlet: Reddit has been infiltrated by Russian bots\n\nReddit: Those are valuable voices that need a platform to express their views. '
'Better yet: tweet it to their advertisers.  Geico is a main advertiser on Reddit.'
"well i'll consider the source here."
"Good. Stuff like this keeps the momentum of the investigation going, and helps us avoid normalizing Trump's shenanigans."
'Because something trending on Twitter ever accomplished anything? Come on guys, we need more before we are happy.'
"As a Russian (real, not shill; yes, funny, I know), I hope you'll impeach him and maybe, I don't know, we can... not have a nuclear war and then we can rebuild our relationship by basically necromancing it back from the grave?"
"No but you know it's the only other way to reach Trump in his delusional world other then fox and he is probably gonna see it and have a shit fit. So that's comforting to know. "

'A buddy of mine used to work for a streaming production company that was contacted during the campaign to live stream a pro Trump event.

'Was this comment inspired by a collage of articles hanging on your wall with little red strings attaching them together?'
"Giving billionaires tax cuts is going to improve the economy? How is that?\n\nSpending more money to fund the lavish lifestyles of private defense contractors is not 'stengthening' our military. Especially since republicans vote against increasing benefits to our vets and active duty every time.\n\nHmm, so how do you appease Putin? 1) remove the sanctions from his oligarchs. 2) sell state secrets and classified Intel to said cronies. 3) do nothing in retaliation for hacking voter rolls in over 20 states. 4) do nothing in retaliation for hacking DNC. 5) launder money for Russian oligarchs who obtained said money by stealing it from Russian citizens and their oil reserve pension program. 6) never speak out about the human rights violations Russia commits regularly such as the arrest of political opponents or the 'disappearances' of certain journalists. 7) threaten to sue and censor the media if they speak poorly about you or your 'allies'. 8) attempt to set up a private channel of communication to Putin that our intelligence services won't know about so you can collude in privacy.9) appoint the CEO of the oil company that wants to make a trillion dollar deal with the Russians to secretary of state (nice swamp we've got going here, btw). "
"They *didn't* want America to become stronger economically and militarily. They wanted America to become weaker economically, unstable militarily, and more nationalist, so that it would be easier to manipulate. That's why they supported Trump."
"Because we also strengthened Russia in the same way. We lifted sanctions on putin's buddies, and we are going to let Russia have first dibs in foreign territory and policy as we slip down from being a global superpower.

"No the latest is the FBI(or at the very least, high ranking influential members of the FBI)  is/are a corrupt monster who planned to derail the Trump administration. That's not speculation, that's fact. The high ranking FBI agent who's wife got a job at fusion GPS, days after text message regaurding their 'insurance in case Trump was democratically elected' was sent. The same FBI agent who opened the Russia investigation. The same FBI agent who changed comeys findings to not incrimate Hillary. There's written text messages confirming this. This is not up for debate.\n\n\nWe also know for a fact comey illegally leaked classified information to the press in order to get an 'independent investigation' and we know that mueller is a close a friend of comeys, who then pardoned him for doing so. Mueller has since surrounded himself with never trumpets and Clinton doners. But I suppose they're all just one coincidence after another which all happened to work in the favour of the side with no evidence right? "
"Sincere question. What did any of those have to do with what mueller is apparently 'investigating'? I know you think it's a win cause CNN said so, but none of it has confirmed anything other than the DNC and Clinton colluded with foreign nations and weaponised the deep state to effect the outcome of a democratically elected president. "
"Well as seen, they were filled with Hillary supporters/ never trumpets. \n\nI don't know, how many texts were there about 'insuring' she was found guilty? \n\nwhat evidence do you have to support your claims? "
"You mean the charges when mike Flynn was interviewed by that same FBI agent? Yeah nah, after what's come to light, legally that interview is not going to hold up. Unless you think clear political bias' hold up in court?

I cannot see the current House impeaching him under almost any circumstances.\n4. If the Democrats take the House in the fall and don't change leadership, chances of impeachment are about 50/50.\n5. If the Democrats win and change leadership, chances of impeachment are 100%.\n6. Chances of conviction in the Senate are about 50/50 right now.

Then I hope you don\'t mind me asking clarifying questions on what is? Where is that line, what is the truth? \n\nOr is that not important on this sub because we only hate Donald Trump? As long as someone he knew had a meeting, or an interview, or a phone call, those would more clearly constitute collusion than say an actual dossier. \n\nNow that we are clear that I am curious.

'As I understand American campaign finance laws, trump simply took from campaign funding to pay hush money to these women. The funding was then cloaked by trumps personal business funds making it look like there was just minor moving of contributions through Michael cohens legal holding accounts. And campaign finance laws require that campaign funding be used to finance the campaign and not be used for personal or profitable gain.\n\nBasically trump pays girl with donor money (which breaks campaign finance law). Then Michael Cohen shuffles money in between personal and campaign money to cover up the mistake (which is basically money laundering and breaks campaign finance laws.)'
"All of Trump's actual lawyers would meet with him in pairs to protect themselves from him trying to lie about what they discussed. Since Cohen didn't have anyone to double up with it makes sense that he'd record instead. "
"I've got such a raging ~~clue~~ Lordy right now.\n\nOf course, nothing will happen to Teflon Don, but it's fun to imagine that Stormy would bring him down."
"Ah okay, so basically if they can prove the payment went through given how close it was to the elections it'd be hard to prove it wasn't meant to do influence them. Thank you for the explanation! "
'You are completely wrong.\n\n\nThe allegation is that Cohen paid McDougal et. al. out of his own funds to keep them from influencing the election. This is an in-kind campaign donation, the same as if Cohen had given the Trump Campaign free taxi rides within the Five Burroughs. In-kind donations do have to be documented the same as a cash donation.'

'To add to this Rudy G has in the past tried to make the case that these payments happened all the time.  This would make the timing of the payments so close to the election just an unfortunate coincidence.  However, RG has also said "can you imagine what would happen if this came out the week before the election?"\n\nSo if Trump is on tape alluding in any way to the importance of making the deal before the election then this is a huge deal.'
'From Haberman\'s Twitter feed:\n\n"Lordy, there‚Äôs a tape. Appears to be the only one. \u2066@nytmike\u2069 \u2066@mattapuzzo\u2069 and me" (sic)\n\nAs a former editor and journalist, using the word "appears" would be enough to get called on the carpet over. Rule #1 of any decent journalist is not to assume or claim something "appears" a certain way. That idea is abhorrent of every good journalist and is something that is fundamentally drilled into EVERY journalism student over and over and over again. Much of the information journalists receive is false or wrong. It is your job to find the facts and report them.\n\nGood journalists chose their words extremely carefully. They are the stock and trade of the profession. \n\nLiterally minutes after her tweet and follow up, where she blasts Michael Avenatti for tweeting that there are more tapes, we receive reports that there are more tapes.\n\nHere is Haberman\'s tweet "Not sure how he would know what exists between Trump and Cohen, but that‚Äôs what we are referring to." \n\nWhy is she even tweeting this at all as a journalist? As a good journalist your job is not to criticize incoming info, but to shut up and follow the leads to see if that info is correct or not. Once you find out - using real actual facts, not opinion - you then report on what you have found. You let the facts speak for themselves. You NEVER state your opinion as Habberman did in this specific instance.\n\nHaberman acts very professional, but this incident alone should disqualify her from being a reliable source of information as a journalist. \n'

A year is lightning speed for an investigation of this caliber, and Mueller has made stunning progress in that time because Trump satellites keep stumbling into stupid traps.

"I am a lawyer. If this memo is accurate, which I highly doubt, then yeah, it's not acceptable in any way. That said, your conclusion is fundamentally flawed.\n\n>it seems like a bunch of very powerful people intentionally mislead a federal judge in order to get a warrant to spy on their political opponents.\n\nFBI agents and administrators do not have political opponents. They may have political leanings, but that's fine and not the issue here. For what it's worth, most of the FBI is staunchly Republican - the vast majority, actually. Using this to paint the FBI as a bunch of liberals hell-bent on taking down conservatives is the most absurd thing I've ever fucking heard.\n\nIf the memo is true, what we have here is an abuse of the FISA system by the FBI for the sake of convenience in targeting someone who has been on the FBI's radar as a Russian asset since long before the Trump campaign. I agree that this would not be acceptable in any way. You'd think Devin Nunes would too, and yet a few weeks ago he voted to reauthorize full FISA power to the FBI with no new restrictions. \n\nThat right there should tell you all you need to know about this memo and how accurate a picture it paints."
'what kinda timeline you thinking for Mueller to be fired? just wondering so i can talk to you again in a few months. feel free to save my comment :)'
"Yea.... This wasn't even about the basis of the investigation. It was supposedly the basis for surveillance. Congress empowered the Muller's investigation, not a fisa warrant.\n\nNot to mention that so far this is been disputed by senior leaders in both parties, and is based on hearsay from a man who has already had to recuse himself due to being ultra partisan. Nunes is wrapped just a deeply in this as Flynn and has every motivation to mislead the public about the investigation."

Mueller will be excused shortly after the nominee replacing Rosenstein is hired.\n\nI give the investigation a month to continue as it exists before it is turned into hireups hiding evidence from actual investigators.\n\nMueller and his team need to find a way to legally release information to the state of NY for their own investigation into state crimes. Then we need Democrats to take control of the house and senate in order to expand checks and balances.\n\nIn short I think this could all go south very quickly and recovery may not occur for a very long time.'

Then Trump will tweet "I have always steamed my own pants, I know how to use the machine better than anyone, believe me. HUGE steam control!" After consulting some chicken bones that have been cast in the dirt, Trump\'s loyal followers will determine that coal is out, steam is in, and a new steampunk era begins.\n\n*Technically it is but a single page, folded into 8 tiny pages by some Deep State operative who is out to make Trump look stupid.

'Whenever there is a vacancy in the presidency, the vice president moves up to become the president automatically. If the presidency and vice presidency are both vacant at the same time, then the order of succession applies and the Speaker of the House becomes the president.\n\nWhenever there is a vacancy in the vice presidency, the president nominates a vice president and that person is confirmed by the House of Representatives.\n\nSo if Trump is removed, Pence will become the president and choose a vice president to be confirmed by the House. The only way that Ryan becomes president through the line of succession is if Trump and Pence are removed at the same time. Then Ryan would automatically become the president and nominate a vice president.\n\nHowever, if Trump is impeached but not Pence, Pence would become the president and could choose Ryan as his vice president. Then if Pence is later removed from office, Ryan would rise to the presidency.'

Firing Mueller would have zero effect on this case as Mueller is not prosecuting this case, but his office and either Mueller or his successor will receive the benefits (evidence) and a witness (Cohen) that can be pretty powerful against Trump, and he can do nothing, even the illegal promise of a pardon would not help in that it will ensure that some counts would be prosecuted at the state level. Even states have campaign contribution laws. However the evidence and even the venue may not support a prosecution of Cohen or Trump. I think though, the presecution of the abuse of the Taxi medallions, if they can rise to a felony level, will be prosecuted at the State or local level, although I am not sure of the penalties.'

Holy mother of god... I'm sorry, do you work for those people or something? Someone has you wrapped around their finger if you actually believe what you just said.

'Actually, Obama made **TWO** appointments to SCOTUS, Sotomayor and Kagan. The GOP Senate, however, denied him a third. by not allowing a Senate vote. Any SCOTUS appointee would normally recuse himself for a COI on any matter relating to the President who appointed him. You can bet that if any potential appointee who get to a Senate Hearing, that will be the no.1 question. I do not think though, that Trump will get enough GOP votes to confirm (he needs all of them) and if he waits until after the election and the Dems win the Senate, the likelihood of getting a SCOTUS appointment through the Senate hearing and to a vote before Mueller releases his report would be slim.'
"Garland did not get a hearing because Mitch McConnell, the Senate leader, did not schedule a hearing or a vote, especially for a Democratic Presidents choice..But Gorsuch had a hearing and a confirmation vote, it was early into Trump's administration and it was before the GOP lost a seat in Georgia and McCain was still voting., it was before the Mueller investigation and before all of his other bad choices. The GOP are down to a one vote margin, with 6 senators not willing to vote for just anybody, anymore.\n\nGorsuch was (is) a conservative Jurist, but not a Scalia and was even acceptable for a few Democrats considering what Trump may have chosen.\n\nMy point is that it will be very hard for McConnell to ramrod a Trump choice for SCOTUS through the Senate this time around. And the choice is against the clock as Congress adjourns in August, even though Mcconnel has told them to stay put, even the Republicans want some time to vet Trumps choices Should he not get a vote before September, he wont until after the election as some  Senators, GOP and Dems, will be leaving to campaign for their own seats in September to November. after November and if there is a new Senate Majority in Jan, Mcconnell will have one final hurrah, but most likely a contentious candidate will not have a vote."

Those would turn out to be key states for his victory.\n"

'He might be psychologically compromised but definitely not an idiot.'
"Usually the Mueller team doesn't announce anything at all, even after the fact, but the Trump administration is a leaky sieve, so the Trumpsters who have meetings with the Justice League might talk about what was discussed in those meetings.

'Wow who could‚Äôve ever guessed I wasn‚Äôt a seasoned prosecutor.... you must be a genius to detect such things.  It still must bother you, though, that I‚Äôm right, and all this is a complete farce, by Republicans, to give Trump more TIME to do more damage\n\nMueller will never risk America‚Äôs stability to bring down the leader of his own party and anyone who tells you otherwise is just another Trump apologist'

"We're all speculating. I mean, were posting on The_Mueller (and me on T_d) on theories regarding x, y, and z. \n\nI'll accept the results if the underlying facts are present to support the conclusions. That's what has been so frustrating for me for so long, we're told an outcome but not provided the underlying basis (e.g. Russians hacked the DNC, per FBI, but FBI never looked at key evidence). Certainly the Papadopoulos(sp) statement provided the necessary evidence, so at least that's a good start. "

'Good bot'
"There have been no leaks from the Mueller camp as far as I understand - most leaks, based on the details they address, are either coming from aids, lawyers, etc of the witnesses themselves. \n\nMueller & Co have been a brick wall, and outside of broad details - like Spicey spending the day being interviewed and such - much of what we're getting is fairly delayed and still pretty vague"

"It's hard for me to differentiate between what I think will happen and what I hope will happen.  If I'm honest with myself, I think the odds of anything that seems like justice are very low.  A few low-level staffers go to jail, one mid-level guy (Cohen maybe?) goes to prison, and no big fish get hooked and in the end no one is satisfied."
"Do you think so? Putin is the human embodiment of ruthless pragmatism. What would he have to gain by helping a financially-ruined deposed-ruler fleeing prosecution?\n\nTrump is far too high-profile now to use as a money laundering front anymore. He doesn't have any favors owed to him by people in positions of power in the US or elsewhere. He's no political genius like Kissinger with valuable advice and guidance. No reputation to exploit like Snowden; Trump's already embarrassed the West as much as he could from here, nothing to be gained by doing it in Moscow. He doesn't even have any money that's not coming from his Kremlin Kronies."

"I'm not sure what your last sentence means.  Going through your post history, you're not American so I can't even see why you'd care much about this.  I do trust Mueller.

"I responded with the part about the candidate to some skeptical person in another thread and they said there's no evidence he or Stone knew Guccifer 2.0 was Russian. While that may be the case publicly it seems a pretty good strategy to build out all of the details about interference and cooperation and then to demonstrate how these guys knew they were Russian not until later. That would be a trickier thing to nail down especially if it was established in a face to face meeting that would probably require someone who had flipped to corroborate it."

"He's not a troll. Just ironic. There's this cute post in his history about the Dems being traitors then turn on their allies for a profit. Uranium one stuff. But Trump shitting on Mexico, Canada, the EU and dismissing all of America's Homeland Security apparatus because the guy that they all say is bad news says na-ah, that's just fine. He's the first man in all of American history to finally be up to the job of POTUS. \n\nDo these td-bags even realize that many liberals and Dems didn't agree with their Antichrist 100% of the time? I'm a card carrying democratic socialist and I liked Obama but no freaking way I worshiped him. Hell if St. Ronnie were alive, he'd probably have endorsed him too.

'If Gucci 2 is a spoof who was created to deflect from election rigging and other unsavory things revealed by Wikileaks in the DNC emails, then this sort of correspondence makes perfect sense.

"Given that Mueller just issued indictments based on the DNC hack, I beg to differ. A grand jury was certainly convinced by the evidence.

'**Probable cause**\n\nIn United States criminal law, probable cause is the standard by which police authorities have reason to obtain a warrant for the arrest of a suspected criminal. The standard also applies to personal or property searches.\n\nProbable cause also refers to the standard by which a grand jury believes that a crime has been committed. The term comes from the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution:\n\n\n\nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

'you watch, the absolute best we are gonna get out of this is the $10,000 fine. Im not convinced we will even get that.'
'When people ask why the investigation is "taking so long" (even though it\'s been one of the fastest federal investigations ever)... the entire point of proving intent in prosecution is creating an IRON CLAD case that it\'s not incompetence/etc. Since you can\'t try someone for the same crime twice, you don\'t waltz in with the first shred of evidence, you establish *patterns of behavior*.\n\nFortunately for rationality and the rule of law (read: agreeing how to disagree about things)... Trump rarely varies his behaviors, which shows clear patterns of manipulation, leadership of these actors and not the other way around, and best of all, clearly corrupt intent in his behavior.'
'As serious as that first part about intent is. That second line made me really laugh'
'They own his money. And seeing as his own self worth is based on being a billionaire, risking being seen as a pauper who owes everything to Russia makes Donald dance like a puppet. '
"> Tin foil hat rant...\n\n\nBut that's the thing - it's not a tin foil rant. It's actually true. What was once a cockamamy conspiracy theory is now a harsh reality.  \n\n\nI don't know if Trump is being blackmailed by Putin or maybe it's because Putin is funding his businesses or what. Or maybe he is just friends with Putin in general. Trump was never in the business of helping America - only glorifying himself, so if they are friends then I think he'd prioritize Putins interests over America's. \n\nEither way - Russia is an enemy nation if he EVER prioritizes Russia's interests over America's for any reason what so ever, he's  guilty of Treason.

'From his commentary \n\nIn today‚Äôs GOP, which is the president‚Äôs plaything, he is the mainstream. So, to vote against his party‚Äôs cowering congressional caucuses is to affirm the nation‚Äôs honor while quarantining him. A Democratic-controlled Congress would be a basket of deplorables, but there would be enough Republicans to gum up the Senate‚Äôs machinery, keeping the institution as peripheral as it has been under their control and asphyxiating mischief from a Democratic House. \n\nIn this country we truly have a binary choice.  Republicans or Democrats. To tell people to not vote for the republicans is basically telling them to vote for the democrats. '

'> In this country we truly have a binary choice. Republicans or Democrats. To tell people to not vote for the republicans is basically telling them to vote for the democrats.\n\nIn terms of an *effective counter to Republicans*, it is a binary choice.   For maximum effectiveness, you vote for Democrats.   But, in terms of *ballot choices*, it\'s not a binary choice.   You can vote Libertarian, Green, Mickey Mouse, whatever.   Voting for those is a partial counter to Republicans, but it is a half measure compared to voting for a Democrat outright.\n\nAnd George Will didn\'t say \'vote Democrat\'.   He could have, but he didn\'t, and he never will.   He\'s invested so much effort in tearing them down that even now, when he sees an "emergency" of governance, he still has to play games.

‚ÄúDonald Trump‚Äôs press conference performance in Helsinki rises to & exceeds the threshold of ‚Äúhigh crimes & misdemeanors.‚Äù It was nothing short of treasonous. Not only were Trump‚Äôs comments imbecilic, he is wholly in the pocket of Putin. Republican Patriots: Where are you???‚Äù - John Brennan
This deserves to go Full Streisand. At the Trump/Putin conference, Putin said he wanted Trump to win. Next... 1) the White House cut that from the transcript; Next... 2) the White House edited the video itself; Next... 3) Trump declared that Putin is pushing for Democrats and "definitely" not him.

The Trump campaign was a den of spies. So how does Trump react to news that Carter Page was one of them? "Witch Hunt Rigged, a Scam!" -- Just a few days ago, Christoper Wray (the Trump-appointed FBI Director) made it clear: the investigation is "not a witch hunt" and Mueller "is a straight shooter."
Now that Trump is again trashing NATO, let's pause to remember that the only time NATO Treaty Article 5 was ever invoked was following 9/11, when our allies stood with us. Trump is a Russian asset, and the Republican party has abandoned America.
John Oliver: The Mueller investigation is losing support among Americans (only 54% still supports it) thanks to the conservative propaganda machine. This has serious implications on the Trump impeachment, as members of congress take the opinion of their constituents into consideration.

'He could always just resign and strike a deal with Pence to pardon him. You know, like Nixon very likely did.'
'I feel like a self pardon in and of itself should be grounds for impeachment. It‚Äôs practically admitting to have committed a high crime or misdemeanor. Otherwise, why wouldn‚Äôt a President just pardon themselves for anything he/she may or may not have done (including anything as mundane as traffic tickets)?'
'The problem is that we never really settled anything with Nixon. To help the country "heal," Ford pardoned him, and ever since, the GOP has been emboldened.'
"In case anybody wants some legal precent to throw around, [here's a letter form MARY C. LAWTON, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, dated August 5, 1974](https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/presidential-or-legislative-pardon-president).  It states definitively that a president can't pardon himself.  Article II section 2 of the Constitution also states that impeachment is exempt from pardons, as well. \n"
'The thing is he will do it and it will go to the supreme court which is so right wing it will work.'
'Even if he pardoned himself he‚Äôd still get impeached and then he could be charged with a dozen of his other crimes as a private citizen. He‚Äôs committed many many crimes. '
'The good of the country comes first. '
'And I thought we defeated the nazis in WW2. Literally nothing surprises me anymore and I would just advise people (especially on the left) to relax and enjoy the fruits of their cowardly pacifism. Limit the 2A and you might as well give Trump the actual Constitution for toilet paper.'
'Hi folks. I‚Äôm Canadian and haven‚Äôt followed very closely what‚Äôs going on with Mueller‚Äôs investigation lately. I have read that it‚Äôs possibly being forced to come to an end this summer/fall. Is that true? Does it look like trump is going to get away scott free, so to speak? \n\nEdit. Why the downvotes? I just wanted some more info on the situation. There‚Äôs no reason for it to be like the_donald here where any question is seen as rhetorical and a waste of time to answer. '
'I would tend to agree. To date there is no evidence the president has committed any crimes.  \n\n\nHowever; the presidents power to pardon is in the constitution. '
"You girls most definitely do not get Trumps humor. It's hilarious, to me, Donald, and many others :D"
'But he said he did not need to because he is innocent did you even read the tweet'
'"Hey DOJ, can the president pardon himself? Asking for a friend."'
"Actually, pardoning witnesses wouldn't help him much because it'd protect them from self incrimination, thus fifth amendment rights could no longer be used to keep secrets from a court."
'Nixon tried pardoning people involved in his case. It‚Äôs one of the reasons he was impeached...'
'Nixon was pardoned by Gerald Ford \n\nHe didn‚Äôt need to pardon himself, his VP did '
"FWIW, Nixon's original VP, Spiro Agnew - resigned (10/9/1973). Nixon appointed Ford under the 25th amendment [section 2] (nominated 10/12/1973, confirmed 12/6/1973), and it was then Ford who pardoned him (9/8/1974) about a month after Nixon's resignation (8/9/1974)\n\n\nHonestly, I'd be more worried of this type of situation. Where Pence leaves the picture, and Trump can appoint whomever he wants (pending confirmation, but with R's you never know...) and that person could be someone more 'loyal' to pardon Trump himself"
"Pence can't pardon state criminal charges."
'A pardon for what?'
"So now the President's supporters are defending his actions by saying he was just joking. Geez, we've really sunk low"
'A pardon for what?'
'Who is "Y\'all"? Your image of one tweet from some random news site isn\'t evidence that anyone here or anyone in significant numbers was calling for a Clinton self-pardon. Your post is the first time I ever even heard it mentioned.'
'Core question.\n\nWhy does an innocent man feel the need to talk about self-pardon at all? \n\nWhy tweet it? No one asked him how big his pardon was. '
'I know it‚Äôs wrong but I wish his base could be held accountable in some way'
"The idea behind not letting a President be indicted is that indictment only requires a prosecutor and a grand jury, whereas impeachment (in theory) reflects the will of the people. If a tough prosecutor wants to disrupt the President's ability to do his job, he can, if the President is indictable. Of course, that theory depends on the belief that Congress, as you said, would take their job seriously."
'That\'s a good point. I think though that SCOTUS will not expand the powers of the Executive Branch and allowing Trump "unfettered" pardon powers and the reason you gave would be just one of many.\n\nI do not think that Donald Trump has ever even read the Constitution.'
'Dude learn to read he asked of he could pardon himself.'

'> Sessions testified before Congress in November 2017 that he ‚Äúpushed back‚Äù against the proposal made by former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos at a March 31, 2016 campaign meeting. Then a senator from Alabama, Sessions chaired the meeting as head of the Trump campaign‚Äôs foreign policy team.\n\n> ‚ÄúYes, I pushed back,‚Äù Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee on Nov. 14, when asked whether he shut down Papadopoulos‚Äô proposed outreach to Russia.\n\n> Sessions has since also been q meeting told Reuters they gave their version of events to FBI agents or congressional investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 election. Although the accounts they provided to Reuters differed in certain respects, all three, who declined to be identified, said Sessions had expressed no objections to Papadopoulos‚Äô idea.\n\n'
"Who hasn't lied about Russia meeting so far? "
'Seeing "Honorable" on the placard in front of him is a good laugh.'
"Here's a genuine question. Isn't it important that Sessions is not fired, because he is one of the barriers between Mueller and the president? "

'Completely out of the loop and can\'t really understand what the issue is here. I can clearly hear Putin say in russian - before being interrupted by the translator voice-over - saying "Yes, I would have wanted him to win". I didnt hear him say "Yes, I did. Yes, I did". It looks like the question was translated to russian wrong and his reaponse also translated from russian wrong. Or am i missing somethi here?\n\nEDIT: just watched the russian side of the question. The question was translated as "mr president, did you want Trump to win the election and did you direct --" thats where the question is cut off by the translator. Putin removes his earpiece even before the translator stops (more than likely does not even hear the beginning of the second part) and he replies "yes, i would have wanted him to win because he wanted to normalize relationships between our countries".'

"That actually is correct. What they miss is that Mueller could simply refer the evidence to the proper US Attorney office. Mueller has a very specific scope for his investigation. I believe his prosecution of Manafort is within that scope, but to claim otherwise is not a ludicrous argument because we don't have enough publicly-available information to make that determination."
'That\'s not really the Manafort argument, though. Mueller is called a "Special" Counsel for a reason: his office exists for a special purpose. If he finds evidence of crimes that fall out of his mandate, it\'s his responsibility to refer that evidence to the proper US Attorney, as he did in Michael Cohen\'s case. Your hypothetical doesn\'t really work because it deals with ordinary crimes which would be prosecuted by an ordinary prosecutorial office, meaning they can bring one charge as easily as another (assuming they have the evidence, obviously). It\'s not the same for a Special Counsel.'

'I suspect the reason they want to hurry up with the investigation is less about them believing trump is innocent, I think there is probably enough evidence to move for impeachment right now. I suspect what we all believe to be true, which is that Congress is complicit, and probably has been in bed with the Russians for far longer than we as citizens are aware of. I would not be surprised to discover that Russia (specifically Russian oligarchs) have compromised the Republican party as far back as the nixon administration.'

'If I had to guess I think it falls under the mentality that you support the president no matter what, I remember hearing that a lot during the Bush 2 administration. \n\nWhich as a mentality is super scary to me. '
"Yo this is Dick Painter, though.\n\nHe has been a genuine progressive since 2014. He talked about how Super PAC ruined democracies and supported movements to decentralize choices back to the people, even mentioned ads attacks by Right-Wing organizations against Obama as the reason. Also, he's only Bush Chief Ethics Lawyer for two years in 2005 to 2007. I think he's the genuinely good nevertrumper Republican.\n\nAlso, he's hilarious. Take a look at his tweets and interviews. Really the rising shining diamond in the whole Republican dumpster."
"To be fair, how many times has Trump been called out for golfing yet continues to golf? I think that even if he knows that he shouldn't golf or scream curses at the FBI, he just can't help himself. He's impulsive."

'You‚Äôre giving the Republicans too much credit.  They think that the Mueller investigation is a witch hunt, so the fact that Walker is hanging out with Maria Butina won‚Äôt matter to them at all.  '

"> every decent lawyer in the country should be clamoring to represent him.\n\nThey are - it's those who have a shitler leftist reputation to consider who choose not too.. Hello? Common Sense?

"Whenever I speak to career civil servants, regardless of their political affiliations - they find any notions of deep state conspiracies laughable.\n\nNot because it might not potentially exist, but only because the ever increasing cutbacks to government funding (military and LE excepted) make it harder and harder for honest and well-intentioned folks to do their jobs to the best of their ability.\n\nIf anything, the mainly Republican restrictions increasingly forced on these hard working people, have left them with *no time* to indulge in such silliness!\n\nThe conspiracies I hear about involve infiltration by sinister marginal yet influential interest groups such as the NRA. \n\nIronically I get the impression that even if the NRA influence was eliminated, this modern absurdly flawed interpretation of 2A has permeated our politics deep enough to make little difference.\n\nWe have gun control laws on the books right now, which the Republicans have limited the proper enforcement of. \n\nThe fact that Congress can't fix NICs is evidence enough of exactly who has maliciously infiltrated and polluted our politics!\n"

I watched a segment from Tucker Carlson\'s show just a while ago and it was about tax liens that are held against Michael Avanatti - who he kept calling "creepy porn lawyer" - in what seemed to me to be an effort to equivocate the allegations against Trump with these allegations against Avanatti.\n\nIt\'s either lost on him how much more important it is that Trump follow the law than it is Avanatti follow the same or similar laws or they are intentionally deceiving. I\'d bet on the latter.'

For those un-aware a constitutional crisis just means we have to admit out constitution missed something and we have to amend it. It\'s a crisis because nobody has a set of rules to following. This has happened regularly in American History. 27 times but actually 17 times after the orig bill of rights (10). Fun fact, I just did some rough numbers and it happens every 11 years on average.

He asked for, and received, a prepared group of emails from the Trump administration.\n\nHe had also received the **full**, untouched set of emails over four months prior, without their knowledge."
'Actual question, it‚Äôs going to sound trollish but I‚Äôm honestly curious and looking for an answer. According to a few different news stories the wording for Hillary‚Äôs case was changed so congress wouldn‚Äôt prosecute her for legal wrong doing. (I‚Äôm not even going to try and take a stance on if she‚Äôs guilty or not. Everyone knows it‚Äôs a heated topic and I peronsally have not researched enough to personally feel confident debating it.)

'My favourite one here for school funding is our country‚Äôs foremost conservative ‚Äúthink tank‚Äù using standardized test scores across public and private schools as the sole metric of comparison to say that private schools are inherently better at providing education.

As a result their ‚Äústudy‚Äù doesn‚Äôt take into account the effects of socio-economic standing on education outcome. But they‚Äôve convinced all these lower-middle class, blue collar types that could never afford private education that private education is the superior option and the only thing keeping them from being able to put their kids into a private school is the couple hundred dollars from their income taxes that are allocated to education funding. So they vote for the party that wants to cut taxes. Ignoring the fact that the taxes being cut aren‚Äôt their taxes because they‚Äôre already in the lowest possible tax bracket.

'You all are right about him, IMO. You are wrong about who or what he is primarily investigating. He is investigating Uranium One. This is within the scope of his orders, since Manafort was involved in both the "Russian interference in the election," and in Uranium One. Uranium One even provides the only motive for Russia to interfere on Trump\'s behalf. If Putin, et. al. can bribe Clinton so easily, nominally a plus for Russia, who else can easily control her? A Clinton win would have placed American foreign policy up for sale to the highest bidder, as proven by Uranium One, so it would have been irresponsible for Russia not to clandestinely sabotage her campaign and/or prop up Trump\'s. An unpredictable America is bad for Russia. If Russia interfered, thanks! Don\'t do it again, arrest all involved if true.'

Listen I didn‚Äôt care when obama was trying to be buddy buddy with putin, it‚Äôs better for the US.

You'd all be better served organizing all of this and keeping it quiet until you actually have something real to say. \n\nThese tactics used to work very well. Generally known as an October surprise. (October surprise is a news event deliberately created or timed or sometimes occurring spontaneously to influence the outcome of an election.) The event created doubt about the candidate. After the election, the story would go away. (Remember the recent Gloria Allred mess with the yearbook with the hilariously forged signature that included his assistant's initials?) \n\nAny road, the people who actually decide the elections are the 'undecided' people. Ironic that the people who break the 'tie' are the least informed, right? In the age of fingertip information, TV & newspapers have much less power to influence these voters. It takes almost no effort to do a little research on your own. Plus, it's been widely reported for years how dishonest main stream media can be. That said, the October surprise doesn't work anymore. Used to be calling someone a 'racist' was the coup de gr√¢ce for anyone. It's impossible to defend. Now the word of the day is 'pedophile.' People see through it now. That why the left is not in power. "

What made me laugh is that the Anonymous Dem candidate is polling at 45% against Nunes\' 50%. Since Cal isn\'t a First past the post state, Nunes could lose his district spectacularly. '

'Director of rooms...\n\n>Just checking the walls, dear'
"Well when you're hired for an important international position if you don't have access to the information your job is about you can't do it. Also, he's still on an interim, which is unbelievable considering his investigators already know he lied on his eqip form and it's been well over a year. If they even find out a regular Joe did that they'd deny his clearance in a heartbeat and he wouldn't be able to get one for a long time, if ever."
'And filling in security clearance application forms.'

"He still got to look at the Daily Briefing: the most classified material the US has. \n\n\n> He wasn‚Äôt actually ever cleared\n\n\nAnd it's even worse that he was never cleared. I seem to remember someone running \t a presidential campaign on handling of classified material and a refrain about jail that related said handling. (That's Trump and *Lock her up!*). Now everyone is sticking the knife in about how the calligrapher has a higher clearance than Jared, forgetting it seems, that the damage is done. It's unreal that this even happened. Corrupt, unqualified son-in-law has access to the highest levels of US intelligence for over a year and when he finally loses the access he *should never have had and only gained through nepotism)* everyone treats it like a win. You're kidding yourselves."
"They had no reason to say it. It adds nothing to the conversation and looks like they're just fishing for upvote (for laughing at Trump even though they voted for him) or downvotes (for saying they voted for Trump)."

'The way Trump uses his ties are a form of body language called "crotch display" that has a variety of ways to be expressed. Another one (not used by Trump) is hooking the thumb of each hand into the front jeans pocket, and the hands kind of frame the crotch. "I\'m dominant, look at my crotch!".'

"Yeah but he wasn't convicted, no president has.  Nixon would have been convicted had it got to that point though.  My gut tells me Trump will resign at some point in the future and he'll be pardoned by some hack most likely. "
"Yes. And the replacement doesn't even have to fire Mueller, actually. They can avoijd the while hullabaloo that will go with that. It would be far more effective to just stifle the ongoing investigation and then bury the reports."

'Speaking as someone who loathes Donald Trump and everything he stands for, and who would love to see him impeached....\n\nYou really, really shouldn‚Äôt dismiss the notion of ‚Äòdeep state interference‚Äô in politics as some outlandish Trump-ism.\n\nAfter all, the FBI and the CIA *both* have long and‚Äîmore importantly‚Äî*verifiable* histories of covertly sabotaging dissident political movements. Not that Trump and his cronies qualify as dissidents. Truth be told, the fact that a bunch of retirees from the COINTELPRO era have given Mueller their ‚Äòseal of approval‚Äô is a more of a red flag than it is a confirmation of this investigation‚Äôs legitimacy... Especially considering the fact that this investigation has been going on for almost a year now and has produced little more than a sensationalist media frenzy which has come to dominate the sphere of political discussion. This whole thing is starting to feel like an elaborate charade meant to satiate the general public‚Äôs growing mistrust of the government at large, and to minimize the perceived scope and magnitude of government corruption in the public eye by providing us an easy target to direct all our anger and frustration at.\n\nIf the general public had spent the last 11 months reading/thinking/talking about election reform, gerrymandering, the electoral college, socializing healthcare/higher education, tax reform, ways to de-escalate war in the Middle East, etc. instead of squandering our precious mental energy raging over Trump‚Äôs blatant lack of integrity as we intently study every new tidbit of obscure and un-actionable intel to arise from this investigation, we‚Äôd be 11 months closer to actually bringing about the positive change we‚Äôre all so desperate for. Alas, the MSM is dead-set on making sure we read/think/talk about Donald Trump as much as possible, and all our other hopes/desires for the future are effectively shelved as a consequence.\n\nAnyways, is it really necessary for us to wait out this investigation before we seek impeachment? Potential collusion aside, Trump has already demonstrated his incompetence and lack of integrity a hundred times over. The way things are going now, Trump‚Äôs 4-year term will be over by the time the FBI has collected enough actionable intelligence to lock him up.\n\n\n'

'It‚Äôs clear that Trump supporters cannot be persuaded by logic and the truth. There is no point wasting time doing that. The only hope is this: get out and vote, and take as many busloads of likewise sane people with you as you can. Get people registered and to the polls who might not otherwise be able to get there.

"Telling them that they're wrong is bad. You just make an enemy out of everyone - which is why we have Trump in the first place. \n\nConvincing them that they're wrong is better. Explain to them what we have and what we're losing (or already lost) after the election and why they should have never voted for Trump. Most of the people I knew who voted for Trump were fed false information and it made voting for them easier because Clinton wasn't a better choice - Trump fed them lies and acted like he was there for them while on the other hand Clinton looked down on people and acted smug like she already won the election.\n\nMeet with him and explain to him why you stopped talking to him."

'I understand where you are coming from. My grandmother is like this. Now she has always been proudly Republican for as long as I can remember and extremely conservative. But since the whole Trump thing it has gotten much much much worse. \n\nWe always saw things differently on a political scale. I am more centrist and libertarian. So naturally there were things that we didn\'t agree on and that\'s ok we don\'t have to agree on everything. \n\nBut that past year and a half have been awful. She constantly attacks me for being very anti-republican and anti-Trump. She has on multiple occasions referred to me as just "another millennial who wants stuff handed to them". Because I supported universal heathcare,  and more appropriate taxing ; even though she knows I\'ve worked for everything in my life.\n\nWe can\'t have a proper discussion in politics anymore because it\'s never a discussion it\'s just her spouting of some misinformed bit of information and not wanting anything to contest it. Lately it\'s been about how I want this country to be socialist. Which is not true and when I try to explain to her that no; I infact don\'t want to be a socialist country I just want to adopt more of their ideals she talks about other countries that are socialist( dictatorships) and refuses to listen to me. \n\nShe\'s also started hardcore bagging on Obama and his administration going so far as to say that Michelle was a transgender person (not her words) and that he was what ruined this country 100% no one else (that was Republican) did anything wrong.\n\nFinally the one thing that has completely put me off with her was the "Grab \'am by the pussy" scandal. She defended Trump by using the Clition defense of "Well Clition had sex with that girl". Yes, Grandmama having consesnsual sex is the same as grabbing someone inappropratly those two things are completely the same. '

Remember this whole caper was used to spin the story after the White House ignored Sally Yates‚Äô warning to McGahn about Flynn‚Äôs exposure to blackmail (this blackmail concern was raised when Flynn‚Äôs public statements were contradicted by surveillance gathered by the IC during routine taps of the Russian embassy. In the communications transmitted from the Russian embassy, Flynn‚Äôs identity was unmasked, this is what led to Nunes‚Äô information laundering that got him temporarily recused.)\n\nFlynn was directed by a very senior member of the transition, reportedly Kushner, to notify Russia of the Trump administration‚Äôs imminent turnabout with regard to sanctions (economic ostracism for human rights violations and illegal warfare and cyber/information warfare).\n\nIt is also very likely that Pence was aware of the Kremlin‚Äôs veto of Romney for Sec. of State, and if so, was definitely consulted about the switch to Tillerson under this foreign influence campaign.\n\nIt‚Äôs very unlikely that Pence was oblivious to all of this, though he may be.

"Now put Congress as an impenetrable barrier between Mueller and Trump and it'll be accurate.  Trump is going nowhere, no matter what Mueller finds or does,  while the GOP controls congress.  The Russian sanctions deal proves that.\n\nFuck......\n\nEdit : Question for those downvoting me.  What do you think is going to happen, no matter what Mueller finds?  Congress is the only agency that can do anything to the President.  And the GOP is NOT going to do anything.  So tell me what will happen.  Please."
'If you want to read the special investigators orders from Rosenstein, they are public record and readily available.  And it differs some from what Comey is investigating.  Comey was investigating Russian intervention into our election, which has been proven, and he was seeing if the Trump campaign acted to collude with the Russians in that endeavor.  When Trump fired Comey, he brought Mueller upon himself with a much broader scope as defined by the deputy AG.  Now Mueller isn‚Äôt just investigating possible collusion between the Russians and Trump, he‚Äôs also investigating the potential of obstruction of justice by the president for firing the FBI director.  \n\nCollusion would be hard to prove, and Trump may not have colluded with the Russians.  But if he did act to obstruct justice by firing Comey, that is much different and regardless of any connections to the Russians, is an impeachable offense. See Clinton and Nixon.  The crime they committed wasn‚Äôt that bad, it was the coverup that made it worse.  \n\nBack to the point about the special council, he has the authority to look anywhere he damn well pleases.  Something Comey didn‚Äôt really have.  So if Mueller uncovers things pertaining to money laundering, he can also bring charges against those with evidence that points to them laundering money for the Russians.  So if Trump was laundering money, no one knows what to do.  We aren‚Äôt sure if we can indict a sitting president for crimes that happened before he took office.  \n\nSo to recap.  Trump could have A. Collided with the Russians to win an election B. Obstructed justice by firing Comey or C. Laundered money for the Russians \n\nThe specific one and evidence that proves guilt or innocence is held secret as it is an ongoing investigation, so you, like us will have to tune in later to find out.

"> what did Trump do to obstruct justice with respect to Russian collusion to interfere in our election?\n\nIf he fired Comey for investigating Flynn that would be obstruction.\n\n> what does money laundering have to do with Russian collusion to interfere in our election?\n\nIt would mean Russia has leverage over him, and could blackmail him to act in their interests.\n\n> do you realize that the Clinton campaign provided information to Steele, the MI6 agent with Russia connections, to create the fake dossier, and that it could easily be argued that it was Hillary who colluded with Russia to influence the election?\n\nCool, since Mueller has interviewed Steele and the guys from Fusion GPS I'm sure he will get to the bottom of it.  \n\n\n\n"

His lawyers have made an admirable effort to keep him from explicitly breaking the law, despite his best efforts. Remember, this sub can be as circle-jerky as any other, so people often jump the gun here. When Mueller inevitably sits down with him, one of 4 things will happen:\n- Trump tries (and succeeds, despite the best efforts of his legal counsel) to preempt the interview by firing Mueller and gutting the FBI. Because obstruction of justice is a crime of intent, there will be a pretty concrete case for OoJ.\n- Trump can‚Äôt get his story straight during the interview and gets impeached for lying under oath.\n- Trump cooperates fully and turns out to have colluded with Russian espionage people, or to have promised to let sanctions lapse in exchange for Kompromat on Hillary.\n- Trump cooperates fully and turns out to just be a clueless old man who accidentally hired a bunch of known Russian intelligence assets as campaign staff and advisors in the White House.\n\n2. A lot of the individuals surrounding the money laundering accusations happen to be Russian.  If I were Mueller, that would be too weird for me not to look into. \n\n3. Source?

If he‚Äôs totally innocent, why not focus on building a case that he is, rather than dragging the FBI through the mud? How does Hillary being crooked make Trump innocent of those accusations?\n\nI just want you people to think critically instead of letting your emotions drag you toward these ramshackle arguments you make.'

"I personally believe that Trump is unfit for office.  \n   \nThat said, your point has some validity.     \n   \nI think the main difference is that Saddam was trolling our intelligence people trying to pretend he was a bigger deal than he actually was.  \n   \nBut in this case I can't imagine that Russia would troll our intelligence community making it seem as though they were attacking our democracy.  \n   \nTo put it another way, Hussein had valid reasons for trying to make himself look like an aggressor but Russia doesn't.

"Oh my God. Bannon is Ron Swanson's dishonorable counterpart..."

And we honestly don\'t know what the FBI had knowledge of before this guy very specifically started deep diving one very particular person. So to say the firm managed to get a "more complete picture" may or may not be accurate.  And the dossier is a collection of rumors, tips, and privileged information, it wasn\'t vetted at all.  The FBI has to vet.\n\nI mean this guy *had one job* and one that he was uniquely positioned to do very well.  \n\n>when Mueller\'s investigation is still in the process of retracing what the Dossier says?\n\nMueller is doing a whole lot more than just verifying the dossier, if anything, the dossier was just a jumping off point.

'Liberal here: coordination yes, collusion, I have no idea because I am not a lawyer. Unethical, oh yah. You betcha.'
"It's not. It's evidence that a member of his campaign colluded, with the blessing of some of his superiors, which Trump and his supporters have consistently denied. There's no evidence one way or the other that Trump knew about it from this. But Trump keeps claiming that there's no evidence of collusion by himself or his campaign, and that's not true."

"If people that high up in the executive branch and the president himself don't need to have security clearances to access state secrets, then why bother with security clearances at all?"
"The problem is we haven't had our executive branch challenged so vigorously by a group of people so greedy and corrupt. Trump's personal enrichment from his office occurs daily. He works directly with Chinese and Russian business partners to secure business transactions for his company, which he never divested from. Trump's cronies think this should be legal and none of the other Republicans who aren't directly involved will stand against this treason.

Here goes:\n\n**Mueller, Rosenstein, and others are Trump-era appointed R's, but this investigation began back in 2016 under Obama's DOJ. Mueller was only appointed due to Comey's firing. Comey was only fired because he was pursuing a BS investigation that began under Obama. So essentially, this investigation isn't one that was started by R's. They are just continuing it because they kinda have to at this point but there is no way that Rosenstein or Sessions would've started an investigation like this.**\n\nOkay, please help me with a good response to this. And don't just tell me to stop talking to my brother."
"My own dad discredits Mueller because he was somehow associated with Obama in such a way that made him untrustworthy - something about being appointed by him or something?

'I‚Äôm going to be completely honest and say I didn‚Äôt start following politics until the 2016 election. Before then I had an ignorance is bliss mentality.  I feel this most recent election has changed that mentality.  My father has firmly ingrained the belief in me that republicans are only looking out for the wealthy and fucking the middle class not to mention the poor. He said he voted for a republican one time and that was it for him. After seeing the corporate hand out that passed in December 2017 I believe him whole heartedly.  It‚Äôs just a crying shame to see our current state of being. '

'Firstly, the very fact that you believe this Mueller "investigation" is going to lead to Trump\'s impeachment makes me really question your sanity and intelligence.\n\nSecondly, you\'re still clinging to the Russian story like a robot following orders even when the Russian collusion has been debunked. Not to mention truly believing Trump\'s "dangerously destabilizing the world" is some real fucking comedy.\n\nThirdly, not being able to see the irony in your own words as you say "You cling from one false hope to the next in a desperate attempt to avoid facing reality. " this couldn\'t be more ironic. If any side is clinging to false hopes it\'s yours. Call me back when the impeachment begins. But until then don\'t forget to take it up to Drumpf and his racist supporters! They truly are the scum of this world. Can you imagine?

Also be careful you might be sent into a gay concentration camp and forced into slave work. \n\nOn a side note, when the cold truth sets upon you and you realize that you were played all along by the media and your political groups then you\'ll understand why Trump\'s not the enemy.'
'Listen, even if the original cause is all manufactured, the fact that Trump has actively taken steps to impede an investigation of himself puts him in the same territory as Nixon.'
'Then why has Mccabe stepped down? Why does Pelosi try ro keep the memo from the public? Why did the Dnc ceo stepped down? Who knows. Truth is no one commenting on r/the_meuller knows a damn thing about whats going on.

I havent seen the memo but like Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park, I do see the water cup rumbling.'
"I'm going to correct you on the whole watergate thing before you can go google it though. \n1.) 5 people broke in\n2.) they were not democrats, but were hired by republicans. They were pretty much thugs hired and had no party affiliation besides who was paying them, which was a republican.\n3.) they broke into the dnc headquarters not just some hotel.\n4.)they were bugging important offices and tempering with important documents to the dnc.\n5.) it wasn't just a single incident of them breaking in once but were found to be an on going thing, but they just got caught breaking into watergate.

"A startling lack of trust with people on Twitter. We need to focus on the facts of the matter in the investigation, which is what this sub is about. I don't go to Twitter for my news. And it's not wise for anyone to be swayed by the popularity of a hash tag on Twitter. That's what the Russian trolls and bots tried to do first. Let's not feed the system with more bullshit."
'Really? Because what it looks like you did is implied that I was somehow dismissing the Russia investigation as a whole because I joked about the poor quality of a popular show that was trending on Twitter.

'Oh I\'m clearly lacking intelligence thank god an trumpet/self described "alpha"  is here to set me straight, It\'s not really an allusion that people want a government to give results when tragedy happens instead of this stupid "thoughts and prayers" bullshit.'
'There are always a few appearing in these threads to say the Russia investigation is a conspiracy & that Donald is a good president regardless of the evidence, indictments & reports almost daily. But even if you ignore all that, surely you\'d be smart enough to realise he\'s a piece of shit. He isn\'t in that office to "make America great again" he\'s there to feed his ego & make money. How do you trust someone who has averaged 6 lies a day since taking office? '
'At this point, supporting Trump is a fundamental difference in who we are as people. It‚Äôs the difference between having and lacking basic human empathy. \n\nAnd I‚Äôm just not willing to engage with or even tolerate people who are that quick and happy to line up behind a despotic fascist. '
'If you‚Äôre so triggered about a public figure that you won‚Äôt even converse with someone that supports his presidency, you‚Äôre probably the one that doesn‚Äôt deserve respect.

'Looks a bit like Jason Sudeikis.'
"In reality Trump was personally briefed by Mueller's investigators before any indictments were issued. \n\nOnly in propaganda outlets like this one do we see Mueller going after Trump.\n\nHe will never target him.  Trump has nothing to fear - not because he did nothing wrong - but because Mueller isn't going after Trump at all.\n"
'Same dumb gesture he did making fun of that reporters disability though!\n\nJesus we deserve an economic stimulus, courtesy of Trumps personal bank account for having to put up with him as a President. '
'That\'s assuming *if* he clears himself of wrongdoing. You\'re foolish, if not right stupid, saying "when" instead of "if."'

Never.  He'll go after Trump once he's not the POTUS.  "
"Can't we talk about serious issues here, like Hillary's emails & how Obama's still coming to take our guns?"
'The idea of Trump sending agents to remove Mueller is giving me chills and making my stomach turn.  '
'So it has to come to this at last. Time to find out what we‚Äôre made of. My guess is Wednesday or very shortly thereafter he‚Äôll attempt the second gambit, he loves him those EOs, and they appeal to his ego. '
'Is there any way that Mueller is betting on Trump firing him? Is he prepared for it? Like somehow he has a backup plan? Fuck sakes I hope so.'
'This is getting pretty scary...'
"I don't agree with a lot of what Seth Abramson is saying about the reaction to Mueller getting fired.\n\nI just don't think we'll see market volatility or mass strikes.\n\nPeople haven't shut down DC over anything else he's done, why should they care about this?"
'This is frightening. We‚Äôre living in some dangerous times but we can not let this fly. Not for you, not for your current/future children or grand children.'
'"Further confirmation of this is that we don\'t hear from the media or Congressional Republicans any evidence‚Äîeven claims‚Äîthat Trump and his associates are innocent.

"If that can reassure you, Mueller's office is purposely kept secret, and he has round the clock security."
"I honestly think that people might protest for a day or two. But will give up very quickly.\n\nI don't see any way that Trump loses this. The Republicans and their supporters just don't care."
'It will be good for ethereum and litecoin. Bitcoins growthrate is traditionally slower. '
'I‚Äôm fairly sure he‚Äôs planned ahead for it. Comey was intentionally disseminating information on the investigation throughout the FBI long before he was fired so the information couldn‚Äôt be easily destroyed. \n\nThese agencies hire the smartest people they can find, and Mueller is one of those people.'
"Yeah how is this not said more often? I'm starting to think that the GOP has gotten most of their funding from Russia for the past 10 years. Ratting out Trump is ratting out themselves."
"The alternative is he goes to prison. It's not impossible Trump leaves the Oval Office in handcuffs.\n\nPersonally I don't expect that. I think Trump leaves office, far before the end of his term, without any further legal ramifications beyond lawsuits, because he'll find some way to weasel out of everything. Rich and powerful people usually do. Most likely, pardoned completely by Pence.\n\nI hope I'm wrong however."

"If they had anything, it would've come out by now. Dec. 18 or so there will be a weak indictment of the president by the compromised Mueller investigation. Already certain mechanisms have been set in place to deal with this circumstance. (The FBI could indict a ham sandwich, it doesn't mean anything.) An indictment is merely an allegation, not proof or evidence. The anti-Trump agenda will parade it as proof of wrongdoing without due process. This will hurt our economy and the stock market will hurt  but it (the story) will never gain traction. Mueller and his entire team will be exposed as compromised and therefore disbanded & investigated. The people will win. The swamp will be drained. The 2016 election will not be undermined. The will of the people will prevail. To the best of my knowledge, this isn't opinion. "
'Mueller is going to bring hard evidence to the meeting. In the face of jail time, "I don\'t recall." ain\'t gonna help him. '
'How the fuck is that even allowed? If a person uses the "executive privilege" defense or the "attorney client privilege" defense, and is informed that defense doesn\'t apply, they should be compelled to testify about it.'
'Trump‚Äôs problem (or one of many) is that he‚Äôs not been in government for long, so he has not had time to assemble a cabal of devoted associates. Most of the people in his cabinet and White House are either careerist mercenaries or party functionaries who would work for any GOP President. That means that if Mueller gets to any of them, and they have something worth knowing, they‚Äôll squeal '
'Plus he has the Presidency to gain if Trump goes down. '
'scantily clad serving ladies might be just the thing to unnerve Mr Pence. Or better yet, scantily clad serving dudes. ;)'
'While this would be fine for a "trip downtown" this is a federal investigation. Making a mistake by answering what you truly believe to be the truth, if untrue, is a federal crime. So, while I am not of the opinion he is innocent, planning for this meeting is not a sign of guilt, just a sign of being prepared.'
"Yeah. He refers to his wife as mother in public when his kids aren't around. There are some interesting stories if you look it up. "
'Thanks man. Much appreciated!'
'Thanks man '
'Thanks man. '
'I expect Pence will be played like a fiddle cuz he thinks he is a good guy. Wants to hang all gays, but that\'s a good thing to Pence. Mueller just needs to say "we know you didn\'t do anything bad...just that bad orange man, that\'s all we want to know about"\n'
'>Making a mistake by answering what you truly believe to be the truth, if untrue, is a federal crime.\n\nThat is 100% absolutely false.  '
'Fair enough.'
'It‚Äôs been stuck in my head all week and I finally got it out yesterday. Then I saw this. So thanks'
'If you study due process you will realize that an indictment is not proof of wrongdoing. I will gladly allow you to argue me otherwise. '
'Mother should I trust the government? '
'Funny how life works sometimes. '
'Jesus, you\'re ignorant. You don\'t need to "study" it, it\'s pretty clear if you understand basic civics: evidence is presented to a grand jury, they decide a crime has likely been committed and vote to indict, charges are formally prepared and filed, and a case goes to trial. \n\nIt\'s not proof of wrongdoing, that\'s a determination made at trial. But it does show a supermajority of grand jurors believes that there is preponderance of evidence of guilt based on what they\'ve been presented. No prosecutor brings a case they think they\'re going to lose, and you\'d better believe that with a case this high-profile that they\'re building an air-tight case.\n\nYou can believe whatever you want to, but reality is what it is despite your opinion.'

"I think Trump will refuse to be interviewed, even after receiving a subpoena.  There is no one to hold him accountable.  He can't be arrested or compelled to go anywhere inside the United States if doesn't want to.  That interview will have to wait until Donald Trump is out of office which will be at the minimum 2020."

"Well, we do have the supreme court if a subpoena is being ignored, they could hold him in contempt (I think, not a lawyer) but as everyone keeps saying, a lot of this is speculative as it's never been so bad that it needed testing. According to my high school constitution classes, there are three branches of government that check and balance each other and the supreme court would be on equal footing. Even though it's tilted to republicans, I still have faith that they would not allow our democracy to be completely destroyed because of partisan bullshit. I don't even think Gorsuch is enough of a Trump puppet to let that cast it's own vote. These people already serve for life, they have nothing to fear except from their own conscience. The only problem is the supreme court has no way to actually enforce their own rulings, and would rely on congress to impeach. You would certainly be signing your own career death warrant if the president was convicted of high crimes/misdemeanors by the SUPREME COURT then you decided not to impeach.    \n    \nI honestly think people are taking the speculation a bit too far on this one however. Why hasn't congress impeached him? There is an investigation underway. Even the dems won't fight for impeachment yet because they know it's not time. You only go for it when you have all your ducks in a row, and the process is underway to find out exactly where those ducks are."
"That's interesting. I was not aware that a US Marshall had that sort of legal authority on the President.  That authority may exist in theory but I would be surprised if they could pull it off without his cooperation.  Is the Secret Service really going to let the President be placed into custody for this purpose?"
"What you're talking about is arresting a sitting President.  There is much debate about that however he cannot be arrested unless he is impeached and removed from office (thus becoming an ordinary citizen).  Wikipedia mentions it:\n\nI am not sure presidents can be arrested the same way as a normal person, because in order to be charged they have to first be impeached, and removed from office. 67.176.160.47 (talk) 05:14, 11 April 2010 (UTC)"

'Pence was a Putin/Manafort pick. No POTUS for you. \n\nRyan bears the black mark of the "cosa nostra" speech and is part of the Cabal. No POTUS for you.\n\nIn all likelihood, Mueller is thinking Nixon 2: Electric Bogaloo. \n\nTrump takes a deal. Cops to lesser charges. Replaces Pence with a suitable interim and they all live happily ever after. \nIf americans knew the breadth and depth of the rot, they would be out in the streets with pitchforks and torches.\n\nTrump will most definitely double-down and put the Republic at risk in order to save his own skin if necessary. Mueller is a patriot and won\'t play chicken with that on the line.\n\nThat\'s why the most likely outcome to all this is status-quo. Trump goes back to shady dealings. Feds look the other way on treason. And the music starts again. \n\nIf you\'re hoping for a "cleaning house" from Mueller, you\'re gonna have a bad time. \n'
"Haha what even is this thread? Like 4 or 5 MAGA autists trying to brigade the thread but the only one even bothering to respond to their shit-posting is OP. \n\nYou Trumpkins need to understand that Mueller has the law on his side.

'S 702 specifically prevents the retention of metadata of American national, as supplemented by EO 12,333 (Obama). I am getting sick and tired of news orgs shitting on S 702, as it protects both Americans and innocent foreigners from being targeted without very specific algorithms called "selectors" that have been very helpful in weeding out financial as well as terrorist crimes of both US nationals and non-US nationals.\n\nI know this is all a sweeping attempt by the right to blame the left for "expanding surveillance," while in reality, this was a re-authorization of laws already on the books. They also keep saying "about" collection is still used, when it is not. Every year, a list of selectors (NOT ABOUT COLLECTION) goes to the DNI for approval after being approved by other intel agencies. There hasn\'t been "about" collection in years. It is all strong algorithmic selectors.\n\nAs someone closer to center than left or right, this issue concerns me.'
'Just another low energy effort to obstruct justice by the GoP.

'Definitely good optics to fire the head of the FBI and then try to get the special counsel fired the same year.\n\nIf nothing else, more headaches for Republicans in an election year'
"I assume this is leaked by Mueller and it's a great time to do it with the thinking that Trump could actually really do this soon.  You know Trump, he will deny this...then what is he gonna do, fire him?  This seems really brilliant by Mueller.  It gives a bigger hit at obstruction is he were to do that."

"I'm a bit confused, the article says Mueller found out about it months ago during the interview. I know that he's building up a strong case, but why did he not act back then? This seems like something that would hold up on its own against Trump."
'Not necessarily.  In a perfect world scenario it‚Äôs possible for FBI directors to have issues that prevent them from properly doing their jobs.  But I do not think it applies here.  There is evidence that Trump just didn‚Äôt want anyone investigating him, his family, or the campaign.  For the inept FBI director idea to be valid there would have to be proof that Comey and Mueller were not doing their jobs well.  If that evidence existed it would be public news.  \n\nAt best all Fox can do is misdirect, lie, and not present actual evidence.  This is why the nothing burger claims simply do not pan out.

'If that is what objective observers of publicly available information can put together then there is no mystery surrounding why Mueller and his team are taking a long time to finish this case. I honestly wonder if they will ever have the time to find out everything there is to find out.'
"I think that's kind of fatalistic. I'm 99% sure there's a breaking point for most Trump supporters and it's only a question of where that breaking point is. For some, a criminal conviction of someone at the top may be enough to flip them, for example. \n\nSome are just Russian trolls posing as Trump supporters, so those ones will never change their minds unless they get marching orders that it's time to pretend like their minds have changed for some tactical reason.\n\nI think very few are so far gone that they would be able to ignore criminal indictments, if such indictments end up going all the way to the top. Right now, we have an ongoing investigation and even though there is a lot of substance out there, it's not necessarily substance that is easy to digest or understand in its entirety. Something simple like criminal indictments will be easy for anyone to comprehend with little to no research."

Mueller's holding that card close to his vest.  What I do see though, is so much evidence that Trump and many in his orbit, have spent decades committing financial crimes.  On top of that, it seems quite likely that the GOP has been receiving campaign funding from foreign sources, Russian and otherwise.

In Britain the words are interchangeable.*** \n\nThe linked page provides much more clarification.  It provides much better definitions of the actual differences between jail and prison than what I've provided.  They do, however, match what I said before.  \n\nJails are local facilities for holding for trial, short sentences (usually local or state violations), primarily misdemeanours but felons awaiting trial are mixed in.  Jails generally do not have separate facilities for high security/medium security prisoners.  That is generally handled in-house through segregation.\n\nPrison is synonymous with penitentiary.  These are post-sentencing facilities that are generally defined by their security level.  However, some prisons will include multiple security levels but held in separate facilities on the compound."

Mueller being a republican matters about as much to me, a Trump voter and registered independent, as what Miley Cyrus had for breakfast... which is to say not at all.\n\nI'll base my opinions on the facts. The fact that his team is comprised of people with CLEAR conflicts of interest. The Mueller investigation is a direct result of the Clinton email cover up. Corrupt elements at the top of the FBI and members of Obama's cabinet risked exposure if Trump took office unimpeded. The Mueller investigation will find nothing because their is no evidence of Russia's impact in our election at all.

My heart sank when you elected Trump - he embodies the worst of your country and humanity. If he doesn‚Äôt come to justice, it will be a universal tragedy that will change my view on how democracy, the principle I believe in, can work. It is quite important!'

"**Tea Act**\n\nTea Act 1773 (13 Geo 3 c 44) was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain. The principal objective was to reduce the massive amount of tea held by the financially troubled British East India Company in its London warehouses and to help the financially struggling company survive. A related objective was to undercut the price of illegal tea, smuggled into Britain's North American colonies. This was supposed to convince the colonists to purchase Company tea on which the Townshend duties were paid, thus implicitly agreeing to accept Parliament's right of taxation.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28"

'The one person who has the highest batting percentage in all of this is the Fraude Taylor account (@Fraud_1), and they mostly prove how often the "inside scoopers" known as "teamPatriot, are normally wrong, or how far off the rails they\'ve gone (a la Louise Mensch, who has no credibility at this point). Teapain correctly called the Flynn indictment, so I\'m inclined to believe that TeaPain is a person/group of persons who *might* be able to see indicators in something happening. Then there\'s Rick Wilson, whose a talking head on the networks and has worked with legitimate republican candidates as a strategist, and I don\'t think he\'d go along with the crazytrain on twitter and might legitimately have good sources on his own.

"The Russian message was not simply to divide. The IRA wasn't some 50/50 'lets make pro Hilary and pro trump' memes. They made a ton of attacks on all kinds of groups, sometimes to stoke racial strife, sometimes to split common alliances among Americans. Putin absolutely hates Clinton. Clinton did not look on Putin's kleptocracy very kindly, and stated multiple times that Russian elections were shambolics of the highest order. Putin thought those statements by Clinton were alone enough to lob accusations of interference by Americans in the last Russian elections. Of course Putin likes having a stooge that has never and likely will never speak an ill word of him or his regime. What makes you think a greedy scumbag like Putin would spend millions of dollars for nothing in return? What makes you think a narcissistic blow hard like Trump only holds back on the one person he's suspected of having an illicit relationship with? Let me also add that it is suspected that Russia also infiltrated the RNC but never released info or leaks. Does that really sound like a plan to 'simply divide'? Let's not also forget that when Trump was elected, the IRA members were all patting themselves on the back."

"Speaking of balls, the CIA's source close to Putin must have massive ones. Seriously, imagine the risk you'd be taking ratting on Vlad.

Vekselberg donated to the Trump\'s inaugural fund, which was a slush fund with about $60 million dollars that disappeard, unaccounted for. Vekselberg attended Trump\'s inauguration and also put money into Cohen\'s "Bribes Here" LLC *while Trump was president*.  \n  \nAnd you think the above with Trump is the same as $50,000 to a legit charity, spent on fighting AIDS or building houses in Haiti?  \n  \n"Both sides"'

All indications are, there's a ton of evidence and leads to follow up on. The indictments and plea deals so far are to show to others involved not to lie to Mueller, and that Mueller is serious. Those who got a sweet plea deal had to have something juicy for Mueller.  \n  \nMy big question is will Mueller be far enough along to drop the hammer well before (~2 months) the midterm elections, or will it be after?"

'Impeachment is the proper method of removing a sitting president, regardless of party or circumstance, how is that partisan?'
"So really, the judge is in line with current precedent. If presidents should be indicted why have none? Arguably every president has broken pretty serious constitutional laws. it's all part of the three card Monte that masks the true power structure that has run this country since its inception, money."
"I don't think the Dems and GOP are on the same level. The Dems made a deal with Clinton to 'give' her the next nomination if she'd bow out gracefully against Obama. That's not at all the same thing as the GOP's rabid shit-all-over-the-Constitution grab for power. "
"Actually I'm Neil Gorsuch and you're a pede... I believe that means you're obligated to blow me till I squirt sweet conservative ideals down your throat?"

'Oh, they have backups on backups with their server probably.\n\nThe servers were never physically took, but copies were made of anything on those servers. The FBI has everything they need from them. Unless something was physically changed with the machines (like some kind of USB keylogger for some reason) they almost never take the physical machines of businesses and organizations like this.'

'Yes, most police are innocent, except of one thing: most police will back their corrupt comrades when they are called out for their corruption.  This automatic protectionist policy of virtually all police agencies makes those who participate in the "Blue Wall of Silence" complicit in the bad acts of their fellows after the fact.  Kudos to the person who blew the whistle on this.  I would not be surprised if they lost their job over their act of bravery.\n\nThis is what makes things like this (and much, much worse) possible with zero repercussions to the officers involved, as well as the lack of a separate prosecutorial office who\'s job is to charge agents of law enforcement when they commit crimes, either within or without the bounds of their duty as LEOs.  The problem is that police officers work so closely with other agents of the justice system (DAs, judges), that it is almost impossible to convict an officer of virtually anything but the most heinous crimes, because everyone involved has to work with the people and comrades of those they\'re prosecuting on a day-to-day basis.  Most PDs have an internal affairs department for this very reason.  Why should that thought process not extend to the prosecutorial, and even judicial levels; at least in big cities, where the extra expense would be much less impactful to criminal justice budgets?'

They can "get back" at Trump in a variety of ways by going against him on legislation, or even an official statement of censure, but I don\'t see that deterring Trump.

"Nobody really cares about states' rights. If there's a cause you can get passed on a federal level, you'll pass it for the nation and states' rights be dammed. If there's a law that will only pass on a state level, suddenly states' rights are enshrined in the constitution."

"Which gives credence to what people say about the polls being bs. Who are they asking? The people they ask still have biases. How do they find the people, say for the Gallup polling. Where do they do the polling? Is it done in every state? Certain areas lean left while others lean right, how do we know the sample groups are taken from the same amount of people from each side. Are they getting them from rural areas or cities or both. The only way I can see a poll being a usable piece of data is if it is done by popular vote. Even then some people don't vote regularly or even at all (imo, they can't complain b/c they didn't give input).  A sample size of 50percent left 50 percent right, won't give an accurate representation of the populace as a whole. I'm not trying to be cynical but how does it work!"
"It's true. Google it."
"If it weren't so scary and dangerous, it would feel more thrilling to see this plot advance. Trump VS. Mueller. Will authoritarianism rule the US? Can Mueller finish what's been started? Is Manafort the last domino needed to cause the cascade of justice?"

The HIC was also investigating Russian meddling but it was run by a group of congressmen, who, let's face it, are just glorified civilians role playing as detectives. It was always going to be a farce, since  they didn't have the same powers or investigative training as the special counsel (I watched one sitting where John McCain started questioning Comey about Hillary and it was a rambling mess). Add to that the fact that it was bipartisan in name only. The Republicans held majority rule, which meant they could stone wall and obstruct and ultimately shut it down, without the Democratic contingent being able to do a damn thing about it. "

In their mind God's law always supersedes man's law, so they have no compunction about breaking man's laws in order to win elections and thus implement their theocratic vision. This doesn't necessarily cover the capitalist wing of the GOP, which just wants to gut regulations and wages for its own financial benefit, but I think it clearly explains how the Christian fundamentalist wing of the GOP has no problem violating codes, norms, or laws in order to win elections.

"So... basically... Republicans rn.  Ken Starr was the original 2016 Republican.  We just didn't know it."
"This is actually rather impressive due to much more massive this investigation is compared to the other SC investigations. Add this to the fact that we still know little about the CI investigation and even with the Russian 13 indictment we still have no idea what several prosecutors on Team Mueller are doing it's only getting bigger. "
"But, I just want to point out i give mueller and his team huge props and thanks from an average dude for this, will anything really..happen? \n\nAll seats of power in our country, from the judges, to the congress are ALL GoP And there's no way they would impeach, or do anything to trump. "
'Well when they literally hand you evidence via social media and not even try to hide it...'
"Also this investigation is probably more urgent than the rest as it involves interference from a foreign super power, espionage, corruption subversion of democracy and the executive branch. With this administrations ineptitude and the Republican party's eagerness to hamstring the investigation, the FBI kind of has no choice but to work as hard and fast as they can. \n\nGodspeed."
'Happy President‚Äôs Day, or as I call it, Obama day.'

"> Next up, imo? Brad Parscale\n\nMan, I hope you're right.  He's the stepping stone to get to the Mercers.  Going to need more popcorn, that's for sure.\n\n"
'That is quite true. Time to bring the big guns out.'
"Is that so?  Did the Mercers back him?\n\nI just thought he's the logical link between the Russian interference and the campaign.  \n\nThe dominoes are gong to start to fall faster and faster now, so yeah, more popcorn."
">Comey is as legitimate and trustworthy as Mueller. They're former FBI directors for crying out loud.\n\nWhile I agree that both Comey and Mueller are trustworthy it's dangerous to say that anyone who's directed the FBI is automatically an upstanding person. We certainly *hope* that's the case, but assumptions like that won't be true 100% of the time."
"> Everyone seems to be on the opposite bandwagon\n\nThat's just how people work my guy. I mean, look at this community for example. We rose as the antipode to /r/the_donald. Among our own community, there are people that think it's going fast, and people that think it's going slow. I think it's okay because we all want the same thing, just at a different pace. You can't get everyone to agree on the way that everything should be handled. It's just impossible to have that level of group-think...I hope."
"Ah, well. Let's wait and see what April has to offer."
"Exactly.  Comey, legally, **had** to give that information to Congress.  Nunes didn't have to leak that information to the public, but let's be honest, there was no way that shitstain wasn't going to do that.\n"
"I'm not comparing the two because, as you said, there is no comparison. Trump has no credibility.  However, I am skeptical of books written by high profile pictures who would profit from juicy material.  I'll believe comeys book more than anything trump says any day of the week, but I'm saying there's obvious bias and I don't have blind trust in him. I can support Mueller and still exercise healthy skepticism of comey. "

'So on it‚Äôs face value, both candidates received opposition research from Russians.  Hillary through the DNC to Steele to Russians.  Trump through his son directly to Russians in a meeting at their office.  Both of those are known facts.  \n\nSteele‚Äôs information, was reported from contacts and other information gathered legally, I.e. the people he got the information from did not break the law in getting this information.  \n\nTrumps information, came in the form of emails hacked from the DNC.  I.e. illegally gotten information.  \n\nThat‚Äôs the difference, and it‚Äôs not really splitting hairs either.  One was legally obtained, the other not legally obtained.  \n\nSame with Nixon.  Had he gotten information from a source inside the campaign vs breaking in and taking it, it would have not been illegal.  '
'Not really, first the dossier was originally funded by the Republican Party. '

Assuming your train is on time, and so are you, then you ride the train 30 minutes. Then you get to the station where you transfer to the other line. That takes 20 minutes. And then another 15 minute ride. From there you either walk another 10 minutes or so to your actual job. \n\nOr you just drive the 45 minutes it takes to get there directly. '
'He could make that case, but it‚Äôs hard to prove.  Especially if it‚Äôs private information that the person wouldn‚Äôt normally turn over.  Like emails aren‚Äôt something that a person would give over willingly.  \n\nIt can also be considered a campaign contribution.  Whereas accepting any form of contribution from a foreign country, money or not, is not legal.  \n\nAnd this is where I don‚Äôt understand how it works with the Steele research and how that‚Äôs legal.  Because he‚Äôs foreign and his sources were foreign.  So that alone is murky to me on ‚Äúreceiving aid from a foreign country‚Äù \n\nIn a lot of cases with this debacle, there isn‚Äôt a lot of case law on it because it‚Äôs never really happened.  We know Al Gore received an offer from a foreign state and promptly turned it over to the FBI.  We have never had a campaign to my knowledge meet with a foreign emissary in their own office that was promising dirt on their opponent.  \n\nSo on a lot of these issues since a case has never been tried, to my knowledge, a lot of what the news is talking about is pure speculation as to how the law can be interpreted and how it is prosecuted.

"Read the statutes. The simple truth is that what the Clinton campaign did was perfectly legal (really! you could look it up) and what the Trump campaign did (and was alleged to have done) was not legal. That's it.

"He is actually a pretty letter to the law kind of judge.  Even though he might not feel a certain way about something he tends to go with precedent and in this case he would have to look at Nixon.  I actually don't think he would side with trump on this."
'Congress is so sloppy with its law-writing, you could drive a truck through some of the loopholes of interpretation. Plus, the Supreme Court can always call something "unconstitutional." With the difficulty of passing a constitutional amendment, the court essentially has a veto on laws that requires an overwhelming effort to overturn.'
'It seems Kavanaugh is suggesting the President should be immune to *criminal* investigation only.'
'Indictment: a formal charge or accusation of a serious crime\n\nImpeachment: a charge of misconduct made against the holder of a public office.\n\nImpeachment is a type of indictment, just like a square is a type of rectangle.  Saying a president should be immune from indictment is tantamount to saying the president should also be immune from impeachment, just as saying all rectangles should be outlawed would include the outlawing of squares.'
"I don't think you needed to clarify your favorabilty position of this nominee. It seems to be that you are simply concerned about the factual elements, which is a good thing. "
"Yes it's high crimes and misdemeanors, especially for a POTUS. "
"We aren't talking about a judge, it's a pretty low bar compared to a president. When say impeachment I'm referring the the entire two step process. Not the first qualifier. "
'I mean he says it very clearly in his article. The investigation into Clinton took up a significant amount of Clinton‚Äôs energy and focus. \n\nHe has made plenty of rulings that anger conservatives over his career.  He‚Äôs never been one to just follow party lines for all his rulings.  Is he more on the right than the left? Oh absolutely.  But as of right now the presidency and congress are right wing. He is most likely the most moderate we are going to get.  If you think somehow trump/congress are going to put a left wing judge in there, you are delusional. \n\n'
"> I mean he says it very clearly in his article. The investigation into Clinton took up a significant amount of Clinton‚Äôs energy and focus.\n\nYeah, only after there is no longer any possible way Clinton will be legally liable to the Lewinsky matter. Given he knew that his own approach distracted Clinton from fulfilling his abilities, I wonder why he pursued him occasionally more aggressively than even Starr had liked.\n\n>But as of right now the presidency and congress are right wing.

If you think somehow trump/congress are going to put a left wing judge in there, you are delusional.\n\nThat is why Democrats are now calling for opposition of every Trump's judicial and supreme court nominee.

It‚Äôs almost always for political or publicity purposes. \n\nTrump is trying to set it up so he can pardon himself.

Those pardons absolutely should be preserved. This is different. This is not normal. It‚Äôs different from every other pardon ever.'
'What if the courts got it wrong? Should a governor not be able to stay a looming execution in light of unquestionable exculpatory evidence when going through the courts would not be expedient enough to save an innocent life? '

Right now, the Mueller investing seems like our best hope of doing that.

'[Russia invaded and annexed Crimea in 2014.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation)\n\nIf true, this is big.\n\n'
'So the head of the SVR, Russia‚Äôs equivalent of the CIA, who is banned from entering the US, was allowed to come here and enter the country, along with the heads of the GRU and the FSB, the agencies responsible for meddling in our 2016 elections, to have a secret meeting with Trump appointed CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Trump appointed National Intelligence Director Dan Coats and others unnamed. And then, the Trump administration decides not to enforce Russian sanctions voted nearly unanimously to go into effect by congress. Coincidence? Kompromat?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4RIeL5VEGlw'
'Well, guys, we had a nice run, but America is done. Pack it up.'
'I wouldn\'t assume anything nefarious with Pompeo or Coats until proven otherwise.\n\nThey were doing their job. Trump is their boss. If he says "I\'m allowing these foreign diplomats into the country and want you to meet with them", that\'s what they do. I know Pompeo is a Trump ally, but Coats pushed hard to punish Russia over the annexation of Crimea. By many accounts, Coats was a Pence pick. Now, that may mean he\'s a hardcore Republican, but I don\'t think its fair to assume that he is involved based on what we know today.\n\nPart of Russia\'s plan is to undermine the public\'s faith in our institutions like the CIA and FBI. Lets not let them win by making blanket statements like this with no proof of their involvement in Trump\'s decision to forgo enforcing the sanctions. We know Trump and many of his closest allies are implicated, lets not start assuming everyone in the government or everyone with any ancillary connection to Trump is compromised. Russia wins when we do that.'
'Your post is what Russia winning looks like.\n\nHave some back bone. Stand up for what you believe in. 2 generations ago, its likely you and a large chunk of able bodied young people would be heading off to war over this. All you have to do is stay engaged, vote and not throw your hands up and be done with it. So grow up and get that done.'
"The America we knew is done.  This isn't unfixable.  We're fucking better than that."
'I‚Äôm not implicating any wrong doing on Pompeo or Coats. They simply could have received a message from the messengers. Or were delivering a message to the messengers. Let‚Äôs not shoot the messengers just yet. This meeting could have been about a lot of things unrelated to Russian election interference. But it‚Äôs highly unusual in the senior rank of the attendees and the organizations they represent, as well as the timing and the fact that they met wasn‚Äôt made public by the US government. However, we found out about it only after the Kremlin bragged about it to Russian Media, plus letting the head of the SVR onto the very US soil from which he is banned, had to be green lit by someone in the Trump Administration, and the timing with the decision by Trump not to enforce sanctions, makes the whole thing smell a little like man trough.'

'In all fairness he rolled while alive too.'
'You misunderstand. I‚Äôm not okay with it at all. I simply don‚Äôt know the reason for the meeting.

'He who lusts for gold is never satisfied by gold. I get you, the rich always want more. But who\'s gonna pay enough to make it worth it? Bill Clinton was paid by $500k by Russian Officials to give a "speech" after Hillary and Mueller sold enriched uranium to Russia through Rosatom/Uranium One. $500k for them is big bucks when you\'re a multi millionaire. When you\'re a multi billionaire, the price has to be substantially more than that to make it sweet. So who\'s gonna pay 5 mill? 10 mill? 20 mill +? And what exactly are they paying Trump for?? Build a case? There was no good reason for Russia to want Trump in office. They don\'t give a crap. If anything Russian would want Hillary since her and Bill and have already been making deals with them. Mueller investigation has gone on for a year now and there\'s zero evidence of collusion. His investigation is likely to end in the next couple weeks. Mueller asked for a 6 month extension and was denied. So what did Trump get paid for, by whom, and what did he do in return?? Seriously asking because I just don\'t see the pieces lining up. '

The only charge that can be brought against a sitting president is impeachment, and that's done through congress, not the judicial system.\n\nI think Mueller is actually quite deliberate and intelligent in this: He's building a huge, undeniable case against Trump, with charges/convictions all around Trump, so that the house/senate will be compelled to impeach Trump.

Trump is the most criticized President in recent history or that Obama can't be criticized for some reason (possibly due to being a minority without appearing racist?).  However that's a bit of a short sighted position to take since we can still criticize anyone without threat of attack or imprisonment.\n\nBut I'm pretty sure Theodore Roosevelt applied this to all presidents to include himself.  I don't think any other president would this be more fitting towards than a President Trump who [can't handle criticism](http://www.azfamily.com/story/37286991/jeff-flake-rips-trump-a-president-who-cannot-take-criticism-is-charting-a-very-dangerous-path) (as noted by his peer).  This is common knowledge.  I shouldn't need to, nor do I want to, point out all the numerous tweets from Trump himself which supports this.  Trump simply does not take critics nor criticism well at all.  \n\nWhile this isn't necessarily an unpatriotic, servile, and morally treasonable trait by itself.  But then again, Trump is the kind of President who would [ask for loyalty oaths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FCKG1-1__M).  Not to mention the numerous, and frankly credible, accusations of demanding similar from those around him.  \n\nLike Teddy Roosevelt more or less says, this is categorically un-American.  This combined with his [threats and attacks to critics](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/11/23/ten-ways-to-tell-if-your-president-is-a-dictator/) (even threatening imprisonment) embodies precisely what Teddy has alluded to.  \n\nEven worse, while he demands loyalty from the public, he holds himself above the public by opting out of military service during the Vietnam War.  \n\nBut really this post is more of a criticism of T_D which bans any criticism of President Trump."

I don\'t agree with everything any president has ever done. Obama expanded the Patriot Act and droned the crap out of people in the Middle East. Obama rolled back protections that kept the media at least some way honest. Obama doubled the national debt. No president is perfect. What I like about Trump is that he sticks his finger in the eye of the globalist Elite Class which is aiming to destroy essentially every country to get the goal they desire. The enemy are the very small group of people who are working to own essentially the entire world and control everything that goes on in it.

'This. Though perhaps I‚Äôm missing something. The Comey v. Trump he-said he-said tactic seems feasible to stave off a political impeachment process.

Charges related to a Russian spy who was arrested yesterday.\n\n"On October 4, 2016, U.S. Person 1 sent an email to an acquaintance. The email covered a number of topics. Within the email, U.S. Person 1 stated, "Unrelated to specific presidential campaigns, I\'ve been involved in securing a VERY private line of communication between the Kremlin and key POLITICAL PARTY 1 leaders through, of all conduits, the [GUN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION]." Based on my training, experience, and familiarity with this investigation, I believe that this email describes U.S. Person 1\'s involvement in BUTINA\'s efforts to establish a "back channel" communication for representatives of the Government of Russia."'

"1. He's clearly and blatantly guilty of obstruction of justice.\n2. The rest - don't know. Abuse of power was a charge against Nixon - I strongly suspect Trump would fit in there somewhere.\n3. I cannot see the current House impeaching him under almost any circumstances.\n4. If the Democrats take the House in the fall and don't change leadership, chances of impeachment are about 50/50.\n5. If the Democrats win and change leadership, chances of impeachment are 100%.\n6. Chances of conviction in the Senate are about 50/50 right now. Will probably go down to 30/70 after Flake, Corker and McCain leave this year (not trying to kill off McCain, but...)."
'I am really surprised there is such a line. This is very new territory for our country. To ask questions for clarification is implied as asinine by AlwaysBlamesCanada. I would think all Americans want truth, not a biased opinion of an imaginary line that may or may not be crossed by asking for clarification. \n\nIf paying campaign funds to Russian operatives through MI6 sources, for purposes that "secret or illegal cooperation or conspiracy in order to deceive others" As Darthwarz, put it, is not collusion. Then I hope you don\'t mind me asking clarifying questions on what is? Where is that line, what is the truth? \n\nOr is that not important on this sub because we only hate Donald Trump? As long as someone he knew had a meeting, or an interview, or a phone call, those would more clearly constitute collusion than say an actual dossier. \n\nNow that we are clear that I am curious. What is the collusion that Mueller is looking for? Is there any evidence so far. Like a Dossier that Trump campaign used on her "Secretly" or something nefarious. Or just a meeting...?\n'

"Well he's not wrong.....Cult is probably more apropos. "
'A cult, yes. '
'Is that so far from the truth? "GEOTUS" matter aside, it\'s been my experience with Trump supporters I\'ve had exchanges with that they *believe in* and *trust* Trump. The primary sentiment I get is that their *faith* in public institutions, representatives, and fellow citizens has been either strained or broken. This leads them to see Trump as something different, someone they know, gives them hope/pride/security, and think they have an understanding with.\n\nIf we broaden the definition of *religion* to include a *belief system* and a community built around that, then I think saying being a trump supporter *is* a religion. \n\nWhat do y\'all think?'

'As I understand American campaign finance laws, trump simply took from campaign funding to pay hush money to these women. The funding was then cloaked by trumps personal business funds making it look like there was just minor moving of contributions through Michael cohens legal holding accounts. And campaign finance laws require that campaign funding be used to finance the campaign and not be used for personal or profitable gain.\n\nBasically trump pays girl with donor money (which breaks campaign finance law). Then Michael Cohen shuffles money in between personal and campaign money to cover up the mistake (which is basically money laundering and breaks campaign finance laws.)'
"All of Trump's actual lawyers would meet with him in pairs to protect themselves from him trying to lie about what they discussed. Since Cohen didn't have anyone to double up with it makes sense that he'd record instead. "
"I've got such a raging ~~clue~~ Lordy right now.\n\nOf course, nothing will happen to Teflon Don, but it's fun to imagine that Stormy would bring him down."
"Ah okay, so basically if they can prove the payment went through given how close it was to the elections it'd be hard to prove it wasn't meant to do influence them. Thank you for the explanation! "
'You are completely wrong.\n\n\nThe allegation is that Cohen paid McDougal et. al. out of his own funds to keep them from influencing the election. This is an in-kind campaign donation, the same as if Cohen had given the Trump Campaign free taxi rides within the Five Burroughs. In-kind donations do have to be documented the same as a cash donation.'

'SURE DID CUCK THEM LIBS LUL üòÇüòÇüòÇüò©üò©üò©'
'To add to this Rudy G has in the past tried to make the case that these payments happened all the time.  This would make the timing of the payments so close to the election just an unfortunate coincidence.  However, RG has also said "can you imagine what would happen if this came out the week before the election?"\n\nSo if Trump is on tape alluding in any way to the importance of making the deal before the election then this is a huge deal.'
'From Haberman\'s Twitter feed:\n\n"Lordy, there‚Äôs a tape. Appears to be the only one. \u2066@nytmike\u2069 \u2066@mattapuzzo\u2069 and me" (sic)\n\nAs a former editor and journalist, using the word "appears" would be enough to get called on the carpet over. Rule #1 of any decent journalist is not to assume or claim something "appears" a certain way. That idea is abhorrent of every good journalist and is something that is fundamentally drilled into EVERY journalism student over and over and over again. Much of the information journalists receive is false or wrong. It is your job to find the facts and report them.\n\nGood journalists chose their words extremely carefully. They are the stock and trade of the profession. \n\nLiterally minutes after her tweet and follow up, where she blasts Michael Avenatti for tweeting that there are more tapes, we receive reports that there are more tapes.\n\nHere is Haberman\'s tweet "Not sure how he would know what exists between Trump and Cohen, but that‚Äôs what we are referring to." \n\nWhy is she even tweeting this at all as a journalist? As a good journalist your job is not to criticize incoming info, but to shut up and follow the leads to see if that info is correct or not. Once you find out - using real actual facts, not opinion - you then report on what you have found. You let the facts speak for themselves. You NEVER state your opinion as Habberman did in this specific instance.\n\nHaberman acts very professional, but this incident alone should disqualify her from being a reliable source of information as a journalist. \n'

You see nothing because that's what you want to see, but the rest of us are watching the Trumptanic sink while his cabinet abandons ship and competent lawyers flee like he's a leper. A year is lightning speed for an investigation of this caliber, and Mueller has made stunning progress in that time because Trump satellites keep stumbling into stupid traps. Mueller has Trump cornered, and Trump is lashing out. The only way out for Trump is to fire Rosenstein, replace him with a lackey, and rely on corruption to stifle an impeachment vote. Even if he manages that, and the lackey agrees to fire Mueller, and by some miracle sidesteps impeachment, his political career is comatose.

Using this to paint the FBI as a bunch of liberals hell-bent on taking down conservatives is the most absurd thing I've ever fucking heard.\n\nIf the memo is true, what we have here is an abuse of the FISA system by the FBI for the sake of convenience in targeting someone who has been on the FBI's radar as a Russian asset since long before the Trump campaign. I agree that this would not be acceptable in any way. You'd think Devin Nunes would too, and yet a few weeks ago he voted to reauthorize full FISA power to the FBI with no new restrictions. \n\nThat right there should tell you all you need to know about this memo and how accurate a picture it paints."

After consulting some chicken bones that have been cast in the dirt, Trump\'s loyal followers will determine that coal is out, steam is in, and a new steampunk era begins.\n\n*Technically it is but a single page, folded into 8 tiny pages by some Deep State operative who is out to make Trump look stupid. When footage of the machine\'s manual is leaked to the press by an Obama microwave, Trump spins it by saying that the machine\'s manual only looks small because it\'s in his huge hands, and anyway, nobody knew the machine could be so complicated.'

'Whenever there is a vacancy in the presidency, the vice president moves up to become the president automatically. If the presidency and vice presidency are both vacant at the same time, then the order of succession applies and the Speaker of the House becomes the president.\n\nWhenever there is a vacancy in the vice presidency, the president nominates a vice president and that person is confirmed by the House of Representatives.\n\nSo if Trump is removed, Pence will become the president and choose a vice president to be confirmed by the House. The only way that Ryan becomes president through the line of succession is if Trump and Pence are removed at the same time. Then Ryan would automatically become the president and nominate a vice president.\n\nHowever, if Trump is impeached but not Pence, Pence would become the president and could choose Ryan as his vice president. Then if Pence is later removed from office, Ryan would rise to the presidency.'

Even states have campaign contribution laws. However the evidence and even the venue may not support a prosecution of Cohen or Trump. I think though, the presecution of the abuse of the Taxi medallions, if they can rise to a felony level, will be prosecuted at the State or local level, although I am not sure of the penalties.'

"Yep.\n\nMueller's the guy who left private practice (where he could make a lot more money) to return to being a federal prosecutor.

"> Mueller's the guy who left private practice (where he could make a lot more money) to return to being a federal prosecutor. He didn't like the idea of defending criminals and helping them get free.\n\nThat sounds more neutral to me.

Holy mother of god... I'm sorry, do you work for those people or something? Someone has you wrapped around their finger if you actually believe what you just said.

'Actually, Obama made **TWO** appointments to SCOTUS, Sotomayor and Kagan. The GOP Senate, however, denied him a third. by not allowing a Senate vote. Any SCOTUS appointee would normally recuse himself for a COI on any matter relating to the President who appointed him. You can bet that if any potential appointee who get to a Senate Hearing, that will be the no.1 question. I do not think though, that Trump will get enough GOP votes to confirm (he needs all of them) and if he waits until after the election and the Dems win the Senate, the likelihood of getting a SCOTUS appointment through the Senate hearing and to a vote before Mueller releases his report would be slim.'
"Garland did not get a hearing because Mitch McConnell, the Senate leader, did not schedule a hearing or a vote, especially for a Democratic Presidents choice..But Gorsuch had a hearing and a confirmation vote, it was early into Trump's administration and it was before the GOP lost a seat in Georgia and McCain was still voting., it was before the Mueller investigation and before all of his other bad choices. The GOP are down to a one vote margin, with 6 senators not willing to vote for just anybody, anymore.\n\nGorsuch was (is) a conservative Jurist, but not a Scalia and was even acceptable for a few Democrats considering what Trump may have chosen.\n\nMy point is that it will be very hard for McConnell to ramrod a Trump choice for SCOTUS through the Senate this time around. And the choice is against the clock as Congress adjourns in August, even though Mcconnel has told them to stay put, even the Republicans want some time to vet Trumps choices Should he not get a vote before September, he wont until after the election as some  Senators, GOP and Dems, will be leaving to campaign for their own seats in September to November. after November and if there is a new Senate Majority in Jan, Mcconnell will have one final hurrah, but most likely a contentious candidate will not have a vote."

"I get your point, but I am about 104% certain that reddit is just cooperating with investigators using reddit data to learn about the Russian operation. Anything else doesn't pass the sniff test as to why they're allowed to still exist on this platform full of left leaning participants. Just gotta ask how money ties in as that is the only reason businesses ever do anything, ever, always. \n\nAdvertising isnt about total number of eyeballs. Its about the number of fingers you can get to click. Theres no business advantage to alienating what is an easily cornered demographic to provide a space for folks incongruent with the rest of the potential finger clicks. \n\nReddit is a business. There is no business case that i can conceive that says keeping relatively small fringe right groups around is more profitable than not. I honestly believe the admins are working with authorities and helping behind the scenes. Nothing else makes sense. "

Having an educated society that is highly resistant to untrusted/or unverified sources and who are able to debate their position respectfully is the cure to this madness."
"I really hope you're right. "

'Come on man, you can be more creative than that. If you‚Äôre going to completely yank something out of your ass, then at least have a little fun with it. '

"Not to mention the alimony/child support she will get. I doubt a court wouldn't take really good care of her, after all that is known about what a dog trump is. (And if she can't live on all that, TFB. I hear Slovenia is a lot less expensive than the US...)"
'So you‚Äôre saying if their prenup went too far it‚Äôs possible she could get out of it and take more than what was agreed to in it?'

'The other thing I‚Äôm getting increasingly concerned by is how places like that and other media echo chambers actively contribute to making assholes *out of* half decent people. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if, between bots, intentional disinformation, well meaning validation of ones worst (or least informed) tendencies, etc. there are people who are actively made worse.  \n\nI find it telling that the red pill/incel crowd was converted to an alt right political force.  I mean come on - they were nothing more than a dysfunctional support group for guys with socio-sexual problems. It was the echo chamber and self-reinforcement that  allowed that crowd to evolve.  I‚Äôm confident any individual sitting at home would never have taken that step (or, heck, have come up with the ‚Äúincel/red pill‚Äù concept to begin with!)'

"This tweet is the first in a series breaking down what we know and the timeline. Here's [the thread](https://twitter.com/resisterhood/status/1018221264077541378).\n\nBasically we now know that Russia hacked the DNC analytics (the type of info that tells you where best to focus your campaigning efforts) and not long after (a couple weeks) Trump's campaign made a sudden and dramatic shift in funding to ads in specific states. Those would turn out to be key states for his victory.\n"
'Good lord.'
'Ohhhh, this is so fucking great. Too evil to be good, too dumb to not get caught, or so I hope. '
'I would have to say around January or February of 2017. When I first read about Alfa Bank communicating with the Trump campaign it made me want to learn more. Then I started reading more about Robert Mercer and his daughter. \n\nTrump wouldn‚Äôt have won without CA and Russia helping him... plain and simple. He‚Äôs an illegitimate president. \n\nSteven Bannon even said the goal of CA was to sow discord in African Americans and make them not want to vote... '
'More like: ‚Äúthanks for the tip, chump‚Äù'
"gah... OK, first of all, please tell me he didn't actually say that?\n\nSecond of all, if he did, why the hell would he say that? What was his rationale? Why is it ok, to trump, to investigate everything but his finances?"
'Oh he has *a lot* of sense. He hampers the investigation by publicly  criticizing the tactics. Tens of millions of Americans eat up anything he types on Twitter like gospel fodder. Past presidents have played the public to their favor for better or worse but Trump takes it to another level. Public perception matters sometimes even more than facts.'
'He might be psychologically compromised but definitely not an idiot.'
"Usually the Mueller team doesn't announce anything at all, even after the fact, but the Trump administration is a leaky sieve, so the Trumpsters who have meetings with the Justice League might talk about what was discussed in those meetings. Everything new in [the new report](http://beta.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-probe-20180106-story.html) could conceivably be known by the Trump side with no leaks from the Mueller side."
'Guys, it looks like Hannity found our sub.  *Better shut it down.*'

'This is really getting good. This is really getting bad. I want to see him crack like an egg. Then I hope, one by one, like Bernie Madoffs kids, they off themselves. I see this scenario going down. Can you imagine his kids in prison? Neither can they.'

'Chances are, DT jr.  is wearing a wire.'
"Because he's an evil fucker, but he's not stupid, and he knows Trumpy better than most."
'When cops close in on criminals and the criminals start to feel the heat, one of the best sources of information then turns out to be that one smarter guy who will give up information in return for a lighter sentence. \n\nBannon has taken this opportunity to indirectly communicate to Mueller that he can give him information if Mueller will do to him what he did to Flynn. Although I am unsure what involvement Bannon had directly in all of this, he seems smart and far sighted enough to keep himself cleaner than the Moron family.'
'I had to look this one up.  Well worth it.'
'Had to look up. Made me giggle. Upvoted.'

"Last I checked, Mueller has already made 4 swings, and all 4 were home runs. And it's going to be 6 before March :) "
'Which part of two guilty pleas and two indictments isn\'t "swinging"?\n\nYou\'re clearly not a seasoned prosecutor.  He has one shot and one shot only at the biggest fish, he\'s drawing in the net as we speak. \n\n>He\'s been standing at the plate for a YEAR.\n\nYou also have a warped sense of time.  Yes, Trump time **seems** dilated, I mean this last year seemed to take a decade to happen, but in reality, 7 months is 7 months, and not a year. '
'Trump couldn‚Äôt even stick to the ‚ÄúRosenstein suggested I fire Comey‚Äù line for more than 4 days.\n\nI think we can safely take this at face-value'
'it feels that way. its a constant barrage of drama, but the gears are definitely continuing to turn behind the scenes...'
"Don't forget the long-time high-ranking Republican officials who accepted Russian money into the GOP.  \n\nIt's not just the Orange Shit-Gibbon, Pence & Ryan & co. are in the crosshairs too."
"He repealed Dodd Frank, he stole a Supreme Court seat, he's persecuting an intelligence war against our DOMESTIC agencies while supporting a hostile foreign intelligence in their efforts to subvert American democracy.\n\nHe's NOT PICKING HIS NOSE.  He's VERY busy and someone needs to stop him.  "
'Wow who could‚Äôve ever guessed I wasn‚Äôt a seasoned prosecutor.... you must be a genius to detect such things.  It still must bother you, though, that I‚Äôm right, and all this is a complete farce, by Republicans, to give Trump more TIME to do more damage\n\nMueller will never risk America‚Äôs stability to bring down the leader of his own party and anyone who tells you otherwise is just another Trump apologist'
"> and a counter suit against Mueller/Rosenstein.\n\nWhich will be dismissed to the sound of canned laughter. You can't sue the people who are investigating you."

"There are zero Donald Trump supporters who like Manafort and the crimes in question took place while he worked for the Podesta Group. Trump was wise to fire him, he's a swamp creature.\n\n[Tony Podesta resigned today.](https://i.redd.it/rqfwn0tb10vz.png) How does that hurt Trump, exactly? Trump isn't close to ANY of this. This is Mueller taking down Trump? This is what he came up with?\n\nYou seriously think that Trump supporters are bothered by this? [Hell, I predicted it yesterday.](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/comments/79cr91/rall_has_not_seen_robert_mueller_in_over_a_month/dp1cwwd/?context=3)\n\n\n"

'Just like the_meltdown. Hahahaha'
'Damn. Username definitely checks out.'
'People downvote a hilarious attempt at spin.'
"It's gonna be so funny when they can't get anything on trump and we make this sub ours."
'How does this make the Clinton/dossier thing relevant? Padapoulos literally met with a professor who he explicitly said was offering help against the Clinton campaign from Russia regarding hher emails. How is that not collusion?'
'You guys still have not figured it out have you?\n\nGetting dirt is legal.  Establishing a quid pro quo with a foreign government to get dirt is not legal.  Lying about dealing with foreign governments is definitely not legal.'
'Trump said it himself, he could shoot someone on the streets and his fanboys would still line up to give him person favors. Or something like that. Or so I have heard people say. '
"can't wait to see how well this comment ages haha\n\n!remindMe 3 months"
"We're all speculating. I mean, were posting on The_Mueller (and me on T_d) on theories regarding x, y, and z. \n\nI'll accept the results if the underlying facts are present to support the conclusions. That's what has been so frustrating for me for so long, we're told an outcome but not provided the underlying basis (e.g. Russians hacked the DNC, per FBI, but FBI never looked at key evidence). Certainly the Papadopoulos(sp) statement provided the necessary evidence, so at least that's a good start. "
'Good bot '
"The President of the United States still hasn't signed the latest bipartisan sanctions bill on Russia that was passed unanimously by both the House and the Senate. "
'Collusion does not require a quid pro quo for each party.  Besides, they got the president they wanted.'
'Seth rich'

"I wrote this prayer in case anyone needs a last minute grace if you're put on the spot:\n\n----------\n\nOur Bob,\n\nHis last name Mueller;\n\nimpeachment be thy aim.\n\n---------\n\ntrump's time has come,\n\nHis kingdom done,\n\nHis villainy has no bounds.\n\n-------\n\nPlease catch his kin,\n\nhis cabinet too;\n\nand forgive us for sound'n demanding.\n\nPence, a pawn, will surely take a plea bargain.\n\n----------\n\nLead us not into mistrial\n\nand deliver us don's head.\n\n>fuck-him."
'Hey look another trumpet so smart he put his birthyear in his username.'
"Seems like a lot of leaks from the Mueller camp lately.\n\nIs it just guys that have also been interviewed by the House, and the info is coming out that way? \n\nBecause the past two weeks seems to have seen a shift in the amount of information coming out about Mueller's investigation."
'Good bot'
"There have been no leaks from the Mueller camp as far as I understand - most leaks, based on the details they address, are either coming from aids, lawyers, etc of the witnesses themselves. \n\nMueller & Co have been a brick wall, and outside of broad details - like Spicey spending the day being interviewed and such - much of what we're getting is fairly delayed and still pretty vague"
'How fucking hilarious would it be though if the indictments are for Hillary and her staffers.\n\nI wouldn\'t mind in the slightest if some shit goes down and Donald "Oh just kidding about all my campaign promises" Trump has to resign in shame.\n\nBut if it is somehow Hillary... Monday will be the most fun day ever.'
"There hasn't been any Mueller led grand juries into Hillary at this stage little buddy, hang it there.\n\n\n\nLOL\n\n\n\nlittle buddy"

"They sure will! Trump will be out and he absolutely deserves to be! Anyone who could hold Trump accountable won't and they obviously deserve to be ousted. "
"Don't worry, his boys in Russia will push the GOP to victory in November. \n\nYou thought Trump was impossible until you saw a cyber campaign divide us so he could conquer.\n\nThe same game will be played"
'It‚Äôs been like this since at least he 1980s. There is no reason to give the GOP the benefit of the doubt anymore. \n\nYou may not love the DNC but the country is better when they are in charge. '

'MAY THE JAWLINE OF JUSTICE RAIN DOWN INDICTMENTS'

'true.. watergate took 2 years.. cases like these have to be 100% watertight or they will wiggle out.. time will tell.. '
"If i'm not mistaken and i probably am, they are working for first actual indictments against POTUS in about 90 days, somewhere in July. This has accelerated timetable since the possible crime/s are still ongoing and threaten the world peace. Mueller can't wait 2 years, this things happens Soon‚Ñ¢."
"And he's been helping himself ever since..."
"I'm extremely curious, do you have sources for these?"
'DNC was not hacked. It was leaked via thumb drive by a DNC staffer, because he was a Bernie guy, and saw that the Clinton Campaign was conspiring with the DNC to make sure Bernie would not win.

'Are you assuming gender?\n\nThe Mueller investigation covers crimes like assuming genders. Careful. '
"My anxiety is actually super high today because of this.\n\nI've been waiting since the raid to see how Trump reacts and there's been nothing yet.  And now it's Friday.\n\nF5 Fire Friday."
"He doesn't really have a choice.  Cohen was his firewall, and that's been breached.   The strategy now has to be to go on the offensive, ride an apathetic Congress for at least a year while he moves what assets he can, and hope for the best in '19."
'Don‚Äôt you think Mueller has thought about these scenarios? \n\nHe‚Äôs got a plan. It won‚Äôt be pretty for tRump... '
'What good will a protest do when the people in charge stop caring about them?'
'Who? They have all been his appointments. Good thing these guys are doing the right thing.'
'Yes. Or they could pretty much go straight to impeachment for obstruction of justice and abuse of power.'
'No, the key is they all have to conglomerate in DC and shut down the city so they have no choice but to pay attention and care about them. '
'Pretty sure Mueller has a replacement in mind for himself. He knew from the start this was a possibility. Firing Mueller does not end the investigation, nor does it make the evidence and indictments go away.'
'Time for that well regulated militia we keep hearing about.'
'He pardons himself and the courts let it stand.'
'At this point I think his only hope is upending the rule of law'
"It's hard for me to differentiate between what I think will happen and what I hope will happen.  If I'm honest with myself, I think the odds of anything that seems like justice are very low.  A few low-level staffers go to jail, one mid-level guy (Cohen maybe?) goes to prison, and no big fish get hooked and in the end no one is satisfied."
"Do you think so? Putin is the human embodiment of ruthless pragmatism. What would he have to gain by helping a financially-ruined deposed-ruler fleeing prosecution?\n\nTrump is far too high-profile now to use as a money laundering front anymore. He doesn't have any favors owed to him by people in positions of power in the US or elsewhere. He's no political genius like Kissinger with valuable advice and guidance. No reputation to exploit like Snowden; Trump's already embarrassed the West as much as he could from here, nothing to be gained by doing it in Moscow. He doesn't even have any money that's not coming from his Kremlin Kronies."
'lol bro'
"Just to be clear, I am **NOT** in favor of this! I'm just saying that what with nerve gas killings and all, I suspect that if Putin wanted to, he could kidnap someone and get them to Russia.\n\nI really wish that Putin would release the Pee Tapes."

'For real though, happy birthday Jasper the dog'
'It would be better if the broadcast times lined up...'
'Serious question, now that Cohen had his office raided, if they found crimes other than Trumps sexual payouts, will they be able to use that against Trump? If they find coverups for money laundering or accepting payments from foreign countries can that information be used? Can Cohen talk to Mueller now or will it still be attorney/client privilege?'
'How bad will our country be, by the time Cheeto and his fixer DO get justice?? The midterms are extremely important. Will Pence be convicted as well? His link to Flynn among other things seems ...nefarious. '
'Wait but CNN and NBC talk about Trump every single day, I don‚Äôt see the significance of these pictures...'
'Jasper has better fashion sense than I do.'
'While I agree with your logic, they would need 9 to flip, not 11(not counting the independents)'
'56 Democrats + 11 Republicans = 67 voting to impeach. **If** you include the independents, then, yes it is 9.'
'this is stunning because typically Walsh sucks. But he\'s not wrong here, Mueller has been getting the "swift boat" treatment for a number of months now.'

"Given that Mueller just issued indictments based on the DNC hack, I beg to differ. A grand jury was certainly convinced by the evidence. They got shown much more than you or I have access to, so, unless you have some bombshell secret information, I'm sorry, but the conclusions you pull out of thin air just don't matter.\n\nNow, I am at work and can't watch that youtube video -- but I know that testimony, and he explicitly said that they got images of the servers from the DNC, and that they were satisfied."

'**Probable cause**\n\nIn United States criminal law, probable cause is the standard by which police authorities have reason to obtain a warrant for the arrest of a suspected criminal. The standard also applies to personal or property searches.\n\nProbable cause also refers to the standard by which a grand jury believes that a crime has been committed. The term comes from the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution:\n\n\n\nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

Don Jr. could also very well be part of the indictments, I could see it going that way.\n \nNew info suggests (not proves) podesta group may also be a subsidiary of a russian conglomerate company, which further implicated them.\n'

'You misunderstand. I‚Äôm not saying whether anything is covered by attorney client privilege or not.

'This whole recent Giuliani farce is an effort to confuse and obfuscate. The only "legal" strategy Trump has left is setting everything else of fire and hope the original arson slips through the cracks. Of course, an idiot like Giuliani is a perfect messenger.'
"I'd love to see your sources on that, because the legal definition of Obstruction of justice is:\n\n>: the crime or act of willfully interfering with the process of justice and law especially by influencing, threatening, harming, or impeding a witness, potential witness, juror, or judicial or legal officer or by furnishing false information in or otherwise impeding an investigation or legal process the defendant's obstruction of justice led to a more severe sentence"
"Because many/most of them simply aren't politically informed. They get their political information from a very small, isolated group, rather than independent research. They accept the word of a single news source as Gospel, and take the word of pundits  as being researched and vetted, when the actuality is those pundits are blatantly twisting facts to the point of being propaganda (and the news source admits this by pointing out that they're political commentators and not news anchors every time they are proven wrong). \n\nWe could fix a lot of wrongs in our system with a couple legal changes for cable news networks.

'Mueller would be remiss in his duties should he have ignored a Sanders link. It was the Russians themselves that made the link, exclaiming that there were two people thay were willing to help, Sanders in the primaries to defeat Hilary Clinton and of course support for Trump against Hilary in the General Election. It turns out that some of the complaints against Hilary supposedly made by Sanders supporter, were, in fact, Russian trolls and were somewhat ferreted out during the campaign by the real Sanders supporters. Nonetheless there may have been unwitting dupes in both campaigns, but its Muellers duty to ferret out the purposeful, and duplicitous actors, if any, in both campaigns. The fact that HE IS investigating the Sanders campaign is reassuring in that he is leaving no stone unturned'
'Wasn\'t Sanders one of only two Senators who voted against the [Russian Sanctions](http://thehill.com/policy/international/russia/344221-senate-sends-russia-sanctions-bill-to-trumps-desk) and possibly the binding resolution saying Putin cannot "question" the former ambassador to Russia?  \nEdit: I stand corrected, he voted yes on that [resolution.](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2018/s162?utm_campaign=govtrack_feed&utm_source=govtrack/feed&utm_medium=rss)'

'10 years? Dudes 70 something now. Hopefully he‚Äôll pass away eating a Big Mac.'
"Yeah, none of that is happening.  We just have to vote and make sure that everyone votes.  We have the numbers.  That's all we ever had to do.  But for some reason, Democrats keep trying to divert to a thousand alternatives to voting, and that's brought us where we are.  Just get everyone to vote."

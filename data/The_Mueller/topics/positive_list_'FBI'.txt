The Trump campaign was a den of spies. So how does Trump react to news that Carter Page was one of them? "Witch Hunt Rigged, a Scam!" -- Just a few days ago, Christoper Wray (the Trump-appointed FBI Director) made it clear: the investigation is "not a witch hunt" and Mueller "is a straight shooter."

Also be careful you might be sent into a gay concentration camp and forced into slave work. \n\nOn a side note, when the cold truth sets upon you and you realize that you were played all along by the media and your political groups then you\'ll understand why Trump\'s not the enemy.'
'Listen, even if the original cause is all manufactured, the fact that Trump has actively taken steps to impede an investigation of himself puts him in the same territory as Nixon.'
'Then why has Mccabe stepped down? Why does Pelosi try ro keep the memo from the public? Why did the Dnc ceo stepped down? Who knows. Truth is no one commenting on r/the_meuller knows a damn thing about whats going on. Im just hoping if the DOJ FBI and NSA were in fact used to directly target Trump during his campaign that has to be a bigger conspiracy and legal situation than the three democrats who broke into the watergate hotel. I havent seen the memo but like Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park, I do see the water cup rumbling.'
"I'm going to correct you on the whole watergate thing before you can go google it though. \n1.) 5 people broke in\n2.) they were not democrats, but were hired by republicans. They were pretty much thugs hired and had no party affiliation besides who was paying them, which was a republican.\n3.) they broke into the dnc headquarters not just some hotel.\n4.)they were bugging important offices and tempering with important documents to the dnc.\n5.) it wasn't just a single incident of them breaking in once but were found to be an on going thing, but they just got caught breaking into watergate. "
"Well, usually the people getting investigated don't get see documents about the investigation in progress. just saying.....    :)\n "
"Tell ya what, you hand over you tax statements...\n\n\nThat's it."
'Because they are part of an ongoing investigation.  Like you know how when you‚Äôre asked to release your tax returns you lie and say you can‚Äôt because you‚Äôre under an audit and the IRS says you can‚Äôt and the IRS specifically says that isn‚Äôt an issue?  It‚Äôs like that but legitimate.'
"Is that what un-involved looks like ? i couldn't tell."
"I really got to give Mueller credit. I don't know if I would be able to resist replying to the amount of tomfuckery directed towards him."
'‚Äú Although I do not legally have to ‚Äú. Lol wat '
'Party over country!'
'He‚Äôs got the logic of a toddler, trying to sound like he has it both ways. '

'Best joke about this was that this witch hunt landed in Hogwarts.'
'Good fucking word.'
"Which I think is totally acceptable, as long as he isn't a filthy normie /s"
'Keep in mind, the approval rating for Trump with Republicans has gone up, but those who call themselves Republican have shrunken quite a bit.  Many are going back to independent.'
"Trump's not been doing so well in the polls since the news broke that his zero tolerance immigration has been splitting asylum seekers, even after the executive order: https://twitter.com/Nawazistan/status/1010482762544046080"
'Don\'t forget the former (briefly) National Security Advisor and the campaign "coffee boy" who will be spending some time in the clink. It\'s the best witch hunt ever, witches just keep turning up! '
"I hope that you're right. My guess is nothing happens. Republicans have already shown their position on this. "
'Much easier to prove \n\n1) He ain‚Äôt rich like he claims\n\n2) Money laundering\n\nCrazy as it is, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he was more worried about the first, which isn‚Äôt illegal, than the second, which is very. '
'Anyone have a better source of this other than Infowars or Twitter?'
'Yeah, riiiiiiight. Sure thing infowars, totally believe you guys.'
'If this is true, do these people not understand how a subpoena works? This is called a forthwith subpoena. Totally legal.\n\nAnd these are the same people who want ICE to summarily deport anyone with brown skin. Rule of law indeed. '

'Looks like Alexi Jones is up to his usual crap.'
"Yeah it wasn't that long ago he said YouTube was shutting him down. "

'For a ‚ÄòWitch Hunt‚Äô, it sure is finding a lot of witches. '
'Current Conservative group think for the past month has been implying that Carter Page was on the FBI payroll, because he was a "Cooperative Witness" the last time the FBI pulled him aside for Russian intelligence concerns.'
'Because, Trump has already established with his base that this is all fake.  Fox will back him and remind its viewers that the warrants on Carter Page came partially from the ‚Äúfake‚Äù Steele dossier made my democrats to discredit trump. This is just further proof to them that democrats spied on the Trump campaign and should be held accountable for it. \n\nGod I hate myself for saying that, but I‚Äôm pretty sure that will be Hanitys talking point this week.'
"Can't set up someone who isn't conspiring to betray their country.\n\nIf only Trump (and the Republicans who backed him) had made him release his taxes, or if anyone had gone to the FBI and reported that the Russians hacked into DNC member's emails. \n\nWhen this is all laid out, you'll see that not once did Trump and his campaign try to do the right thing. \n\nLeaders lead at the agreement of their people. If they lie, cheat, and defraud the people, the people have a right to call a spade, a spade and choose a new leader. One that doesn't have to rely on Russian money, or to lie to the people they're supposed to lead, one that doesn't use the office of the presidency to enrichen himself.\n\nRepublicans did this to themselves."
"That's exactly right.\n\nI'm very nervous that I might pull my back laughing all all you malignant chuckleheads."
'That Trump will obstruct justice again by firing Mueller? Yea.'
"well, illegal servers and spies and rigging primaries, what a tumultuous election eh?\n\nI guess in your mind neither candidate was suitable and they should have ran with Pence Vs Kaine, but I guess republican would've still won there too."

But to acknowledge that would be very difficult for you all, because you truly believe the story you‚Äôre being fed by one lying hat trick of a man, and all of his followers.  \n\nThere is legitimate proof that hacking was done to manipulate people‚Äôs opinions.  This is propogabda 101 and no one knows more about that that russia.  No votes were changed, but minds were.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs impossible for you to admit because you think you arrived at this place of your own free will.  '
"They're telling us even now the previous admin knew about all this Russian stuff, that's why it's all dating back years, AND NOTHING WAS DONE, Why? because they thought they would win lmao.\n\n"
'> NOTHING WAS DONE, Why?\n\nyes reliable conservative voter, why _did_ mitch mcconnell basically blackmail the president of the united states into not making the russian interference publicly known?\n\nand of course he did nothing anyway. definitely pay no attention to the incredibly detailed information in the IRA or GRU indictments, all the very careful attention given to people like carter page or george papadouplous, or the very public actions like sanctioning russia, expelling diplomats, or closing down properties russians were using on US soil.\n\nwait - why are you upset "nothing was done" ? i thought russia didn\'t do anything? please form internal cohesion on russia before spewing further bullshit.'

'Then why isn‚Äôt she in jail? Why isn‚Äôt there another investigation? Why not appoint another special investigator right now? \n\nThere‚Äôs a Republican majority and a Republican president.  There is exactly 0 things in their way from investigating the shit out of her.  Or, she actually didn‚Äôt do anything illegal and the other 9 investigations are enough.  But that doesn‚Äôt fit your narrative.  '
"Lol, well it's still not 16"
"Don't undermine my prayer with voodoo!"
'I thought he had more, but was only highlighting three of them to the court in regards to what they were trying to invoke privilege over from the raid. But I could be wrong.'
'yeah nobody asked if they have sim cards. only one of them does lol.'
'Foxandflends ... a new word, flends. What should its definition be? Friends who lie for you?'
"For those that can't be bothered clicking though:\n\n>\tWOW, @foxandfrlends  ‚ÄúDossier is bogus. Clinton Campaign, DNC funded Dossier. FBI CANNOT (after all of this time) VERIFY CLAIMS IN DOSSIER OF RUSSIA/TRUMP COLLUSION.

'It makes me kind of smile that he spent his xmas thinking about how many people are working hard against him. '
'Ready the ballistic pepes!'
'Frlends\n\nPeople that give you money in exchange for political favors'
"It's not just laziness, sometimes Twitter doesn't work well in some Reddit apps. So I appreciate your work."
'GOOD point'
'Good analysis. In the end it is a follow the money exercise. Mueller got the goods when Flynn flipped and now he is on the money trail. '
"It's called an investigation.  Mueller is investigatin'.\n\nSometimes investigations take a long time.  It took Ken Starr 6 years to investigate Bill Clinton, and it cost $120M (in today's dollars).\n\nMueller, with four indictments within 9 months, is providing good bang for buck."
"You don't half-ass accusations at that level, even family lawyers put in his position wouldn't even think of rushing this.\n\nHowever, if he is stalling, which is unlikely, it would most likely be because many congressmen and senators are involved, and Trump would likely be protected by them because they don't want anybody checking their closets for skeletons either.\n\nImpeachment is not a sure thing at this time, and why leave it up to people who are also likely being blackmailed to support Trump just as Trump is likely being blackmailed by Putin."
'Honestly i‚Äôve never seen the man speak (got into politics during 2015, didn‚Äôt find out about the man until he took over the investigation) so i‚Äôll give it a watch. '
'The patriot act explanation is really good.  '
"it's telling that you have to go back 9years to get anything remotely interesting from that guy. Maybe theres no recent pics of him because he's wearing one of those popular ankle boots Hillary and McCain wear all the time now. "
'How you could watch the video and then post your comment speaks volumes to your lack of comprehension.  Truly impressive. '
'Tbf, Russia had never cyber attacked the US ~~before~~ recently, whereas China has. '
'9/11 caused our society to value security over privacy.  He explained that the intelligence side of the fbi and the criminal side of the fbi couldn‚Äôt share information with eachother before 9/11. The patriot act changed that, and it‚Äôs one of the best weapons we have to fight against terror. '
"While true, in 2015 everyone was talking about the Chinese hackers. So why wouldn't he be more concerned about recent hacks rather than ones not quite so much in the news. Keep in mind he hadn't been in the FBI for a few years so he didn't have access to confidential intel, only the news."
'That is, "raise your hand if the *Trump* FBI didn\'t raid your office today."\n\nYou\'re welcome!'
'I wonder which consider Trumps supporters will go with on this one. Will it be "the deep state" or some branch of cultural Marxism?'
"This made me smile. Though I still wish she was POTUS, I'm glad she's not in the oval trying to get things done while GOP tries to obstruct and stop her.  I think they would have been worse with Hillary than they were with Obama. "
'This is so good. '
"Didn't she have all the evidence of her crimes bleachbit from existence? Honest question, what would be the point of raiding for something that was clearly destroyed. "
'Oh my fucking god, are the_ Donald‚Äôs cronies really trying to brigade this subreddit? For fuck‚Äôs sake.'
"This is supposedly a top 3 post on The_Mueller and top comments are getting under 10 upvotes. Reevaluate your lives you guys don't have 78k subs you're getting played."
'"Her lawyer\'s office didn\'t get raided" is hardly heroic. Just a little something to remind folks about which former candidate is "crooked".'
'That experience may have motivated this raid.  The Clinton investigation would likely have turned out very differently if the FBI had seized her email server instead of subpoenaing it, which gave her time to bleach it.'
'> what would be the point of raiding for something that was clearly destroyed. \n\nShe should have been raided after her initial failure to produce her emails in response to the first grand jury subpoena.  If it had happened at that stage, she never would have had an opportunity to bleach the server.'
"This is what it looks like when you can't admit you made a mistake and decide to push on with hate.\n\nDon't be mad, accept we all make mistakes and help save America. She needs us all."
"Don't talk about yourself like that."

'I love how by this point they have already given us all the ammo we need from their previous statements attacking liberals.'

Im not right nor left.\n\nI see things for how they are.\n\npeople like Comey and Muller should not be allowed to work in law enforcement when they frame innocent people for a crime.\n\np.s their shady police work cost you and your fellow citizens 5.3 million in settlement to the man they framed.\n\n\n'
'Please provide another example that is not autistic partisan monkeys screeching over nothing...'
"Trump does more in 1 day than you do in a year. Aren't you tired of all this losing?"
'No, my key word is "whataboutism". It\'s the classic move for idiots and losers. Whether or not the shit dripping out of your mouth is is true or not doesn\'t impact the investigation. Trump should burn regardless of whether or not the guy investigating him has a few black marks in his past. Trump is a blackened shit-stained mark on humanity and whatever can be done to prevent him from leaving a skidmark on the future can and must be done. '
"I'm not sure what your last sentence means.  Going through your post history, you're not American so I can't even see why you'd care much about this.  I do trust Mueller.  He's well beyond reproach given his credentials and experience regardless of the single instance you mentioned.  If it was a pattern of behavior, I'd be more concerned but it's not."
"I can't upvote this enough. Reading all the 'whataboutisms' people throw around recently grates my mind like the sound of nails on a chalkboard. "
'Me 2 why you defending scumbags who tried to frame an innocent person.?'
'Under Trump, I stand to gain. Believe me.'
'Right now at 335K. Amazing. '
'I still expect to hear the loonies on the right claim that the "deep state" is funding his legal defense. '
'Whooo that was a trip. Guy needs help'
"I can picture Mueller's staff telling him this. He'll think they had too much egg nog. And then he'll remember it's Trump he's dealing with. He'll grin for one second and get back to work with more zeal."
'Obstruction of Justice is small potatoes in all of this'
'Patriotism is loyalty to your country all of the time and to your government when it deserves it.\n\n-Mark Twain (via David Letterman)'
"> What even is patriotism\n\nIt's a line that constantly gets erased and redrawn based on the whims of some Republicans who have somehow managed to monopolize the pencil of patriotism.  \n\nCurrently, patriotism looks nearly identical to supporting authoritarianism. "
'Patriotism is tax cuts for the rich and lowering the age of consent to 12 and the genocide of nonwhite people obviously.'
"They're telling each other that Trump's senior staff confessing to federal crimes is all a ploy to get Hillary (and Obama too because sure why not) once and for all.  Not kidding."
"Mueller has to prove that Flynn is telling the truth. Trump's lawyers are going to argue that since Flynn already  committed perjury, there is reasonable doubt by the fact that he might continue to lie under oath in order to get a better plea deal. \n\nI'm hoping Flynn gave evidence to back up his statement. Knowing Mueller, I'm sure he's got something physical and wouldn't give a deal just for his statement. Oh Lordy, let there be tapes! "
'So this is how liberty dies... with thunderous applause.'
'Bonus points if you come up with a way to bring up Hillary or Obama.  '
"Can we all just agree that /u/fraserPan definitely doesn't care about this meme and isn't bothered by it?"
"Yes that's the spin his lawyers are using, I understand you'd want to use that too.  "
"The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion. \n"
'At this point none of his base would believe the truth even if it bit them on the balls.'
"Yet, I'll bet, if Trump disrespected NASCAR, Ranch Dressing, or anime his base would turn on him in a heartbeat.\n\nSide note:  I'd like to again suggest [Chris Burke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Burke_(actor) to play Trump when this is made into a movie"
'Nixon had supporters even after he resigned.'
"Mueller better hurry breh, Trump is 'bout to unleash his entire agenda on the populace in 2018."
'I mean, he was at least within the bounds of a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù president. He acted more or less like presidents before him did, unlike trump.'
'Oh god yes. But please don‚Äôt start shooting until Mueller‚Äôs report is ignored.  '
'In terms of investigations like this, it‚Äôs moving along about as fast as it can. Keep in mind you don‚Äôt get 2nd shots at the indictments, and a small mistake could miss bigger fish later. \n\nI think the reason it‚Äôs moving as fast as it is, is that trump and Co is pretty sloppy in terms of covering up. '
'when you dont know how to crop an image so you just resize to fit in whatever space'
'I never thought a military coup could ever happen in the united states, but the idea seems less and less farfetched with each passing day.'
"Define 'defense' is, it doesn't always mean violence. I would say Mueller and the FBI are upholding that oath for the most part. Naturally I can't speak for all FBI agents, I don't know them all, but they seem to be a strong organization. \n\nWith that some seem to think that is the answer, but we are some ways from that. I said in another comment, if you think about that oath and the second amendment; it is to stop 'storm troopers'. "
"That's why we need to have more faith in the established institutions to do the right thing. Checks and balances."
"Thanks, I totally get everybody's frustration and desire for *somebody to do something*. But yeah, coups aren't something anybody should ever want, and we shouldn't be discussing them for reasons I put in the edit."
'I think you may be right. I mean trump has always done business like this shirting the hammer of justice.'
'I just hope this stays a hypothetical situation. '
'Ok will make tablet right story tell'
'Shit at this point he could just take the money, put it in stock and have the pension that he lost.\n\nBut, McCabe seems like the kind of guy that would rather have justice than money. \n\nSo in all its irony, both he and the government are probably going to spend more money on this than his entire pension and benefits package is worth.'
'My guess is that $500K put in the market today will be worth about $350K by the time Trump leaves office after he and his ilk are done driving the economy into a ditch just like they did last time around.'
'Good bot'
'Mind sharing with a source?'
">He's not after his pension, he's out to clear his name.\n\n\n...I think I found the plot to the squeal movie."
'He is not out for a pension dum dum \n dummmmm....he is out to clear his name. '
">>He's not after his pension, he's out to clear his name.\n>\n>\n>...I think I found the plot to the squeal movie.\n\nNed Beatty as Donald Trump"
"that's what he's out to prove, that the DoJ is playing politics. "
'Dumbass Republicans, keep attacking the best intelligence agencies in the world - win dumb prizes.'
"Trump supporters are getting more and more cultish. It's weird, because the Russia investigation is led by Trump-appointed Republicans."
"Nope, they are in on it, all of them. They all know full well what has happened and what is happening, and it's been their goal from day 1. "

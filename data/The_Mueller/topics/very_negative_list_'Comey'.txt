Today Trump called James Comey a "leaker and liar" and then issued a presidential pardon to Scooter Libby for leaking and lying.
McCabe: I was fired because of what I witnessed after Trump fired Comey
Trump saw evidence that Putin personally ordered the attack on US elections even BEFORE he was inaugurated. He knew each time he tried to deflect blame away from them. He knew when he invited Lavrov to the Oval Office. He knew when he fired Comey. He fucking knew.
So Trump just confessed that he knew Flynn lied to the FBI when he fired Comey in order to stop the investigation.
Trump goes on unhinged rant on national TV, admits he stayed overnight in Russia, screams about Hillary getting debate questions, says Comey has committed "many crimes". Panicked Fox hosts try to stop him, fail.
Fox News is trying to smear Robert Mueller and James Comey’s credibility with total lies and disinformation. Don’t let them.
“This was the day an American president stood on foreign soil next to a murderous lying thug and refused to back his own country. Patriots need to stand up and reject the behavior of this president.” - James Comey
'I agree that no politician, D or R, would have been prosecuted for what Clinton did. But any non-politician (FBI analyst, eg) would have been at the very least reprimanded or fired. Politicians are held to a different standard on so many levels.  Especially so now with Rs controlling everything and so many laws broken by Trump and co.'
'How does it make sense that registered Republicans would attack the Republican party in some liberal conspiracy? The shit the right wing fanatics believe is unbelievable for anybody willing to exercise judgement. '
'I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy’s office—that there’s no way he gets elected—but I’m afraid we can’t take that risk. It’s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you’re 40…'
'They’re now exclusively the: Fuck Poor People Party.'
'Especially with Comey? That\'s exactly what he would demand of his "loyalists".\n\nMeanwhile, Mike Pompeo, Trump\'s appointment to lead the CIA wants *Loyalists* in his agency. Trump has appointed *Loyalists* to be Federal judges. And he has turned most of the Republican side of Congress into sycophants.\n\nGood thing they\'re all publicly listed... no violence, guys. But how about we maintain a rated list of who got what, and how terrible they\'ve been at it? Setting illegal behavior aside, we have a nation to defend from *that list of judges*, even after we vote folks out of Congress.'
"Didn't he also like, drill a hole in his head to let all the bad blood out or something too? "
'You got any evidence for this, or are you just a gullible as fuck sycophant?\n\nNevermind, I already know the answer.'
"Incorrect. As someone who worked in military Intel and handling classified material you're just flat out wrong. The biggest weakness we always saw was non-uniformed personnel and politician types. Very rarely did they lose clearance. The issue with Clinton was how public it was and how much the issue became a partisan rally cry. "
'"A witch hunt worse than Watergate".\n\nYou do realize that Watergate ended with the President resigning in disgrace, right? That\'s like...the opposite of a witch hunt. '
'Did you know he went above his superior and announced to the public they were reopening the investigation on Clinton because of "new" evidence at the worst possible time?\n\nThat was such a bad move thay that\'s one of the reasons Trump gave to firing him. Pro-Clinton shill amiright?'
"How are you guys legit this delusional?\n\n1. Comey literally lost the election for Clinton. He publicly announced that the investigation was reopened like a week before Election Day for fucks sake. How do you even remember to bathe with memory this poor? This was like a fucking year ago. Muh bias.\n\n2. Trump ostensibly had comey fired because he acted in a way that arguably lost Clinton the election. That's what I love about this, you idiots are so brain dead you don't even actually know the supposed reason the DOJ fired him. You think it's because comey was biased *towards* Clinton, when in reality Trump is arguing the opposite. But you fuck nuts literally do not comprehend shit, so in your mind it's because he was biased towards Clinton. Fucking. Imbecile.\n\n3. Witch hunt? Lmfao. 4 indictments and 2 pleas dipshit.\n\nCan I be real with you? Why are you guys so fucking delusional and stupid? Honestly. Do you not remember cheering for comey a year ago? And heaping praise on him? Do you not remember the pictures of him shared on r/the_donald and trump himself praising him? You guys are legit lost causes. So fucking moronic and ignorant you don't even remember this shit. Legit cult like, get fucked. Mueller time."
"The man with the tiny hands is such a narcissist, he has decided that since he can't appreciate irony, he is going to ruin it for the rest of us."
'Spite against Comey.  I read Trump’s book once (forgot the title, but it’s the one co-written by the guy that ran Learning Annex), anyway, Trump has an entire chapter on revenge.  If you don’t seek revenge on someone then you’re just a chump.  \n\nHis examples are Martha Stewart who didn’t thank him enough when she hosted her own version of The apprentice (which failed, so that makes her a loser).  The other example was a golfer who used Trump’s practice facilities when he was trying to make the pro tour, and when he did make the pro tour, Trump wanted him to wear Trump apparel and Trump felt rebuffed when the golfer said he needed to talk to his agent.  \n\nNothing motivates Trump more than revenge, which is why some of Trump’s decisions seem to be motivated by no other reason other than Obama was for it.'
"Could just be some 'The north remembers' bullshit.  No lying asshole left behind."
"Exactly. I think people are looking waaaayy too into this. He likes revenge. Petty, useless, ego driven revenge. I honestly think it's just that simple."

'IANAL, but it is my understanding that once you have been pardoned of a crime (“obstruction of justice”, for example) you can then be questioned under oath about your participation in the crime, who you spoke with, who ordered what, etc *without the ability to plead the fifth*. You can’t incriminate yourself of the crime that you have already been convicted of and pardoned for because of double jeopardy, so that line of questioning is fair game. '
"I don't think so actually, because pardoning only works by admitting you are guilty of the crime, which may mean you can no longer plead the fifth.\n\nBut then again, I am no expert."
'Yeaaa I got banned for a comment that was barely critical, my message from the mods in my ban was "fuck off cunt". Classy bunch.\n\n I\'ll have to checkout that sub.'
"Didn't Flynn retroactively register as a foreign agent of Turkey because of his lobbying firm?  So Trump appointed a foreign agent as head of the National Security Administration... that sounds WAY worse to me.   Then Flynn immediately began planning to carry out the wishes of the corrupt Turkish government with an illegal kidnapping."

'Even Steve Bannon sees the writing on the wall, idiot. \n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/03/donald-trump-russia-steve-bannon-michael-wolff\n\nBannon has criticised Trump’s decision to fire Comey. In Wolff’s book, obtained by the Guardian ahead of publication from a bookseller in New England, he suggests White House hopes for a quick end to the Mueller investigation are gravely misplaced.\n\n“You realise where this is going,” he is quoted as saying. “This is all about money laundering. Mueller chose [senior prosecutor Andrew] Weissmann first and he is a money-laundering guy. Their path to fucking Trump goes right through Paul Manafort, Don Jr and Jared Kushner … It’s as plain as a hair on your face.”\n\nLast month it was reported that federal prosecutors had subpoenaed records from Deutsche Bank, the German financial institution that has lent hundreds of millions of dollars to the Kushner property empire. Bannon continues: “It goes through Deutsche Bank and all the Kushner shit. The Kushner shit is greasy. They’re going to go right through that. They’re going to roll those two guys up and say play me or trade me.”\n\nScorning apparent White House insouciance, Bannon reaches for a hurricane metaphor: “They’re sitting on a beach trying to stop a Category Five.”'
"you need charges to throw someone in jail. It's not just used for waiting for trial, but also for shorter sentences. That doesn't automatically mean they will get due process. The term prison and jail have been used interchangeably.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison?wprov=sfla1"
'Police station is where you go when you’re arrested. Jail is when you’re sentenced to under 1 year, or awaiting bail.  prison is over 1 year. '
'Police put people in jail constantly with just reasonable suspicion  they can just say you’re guilty and then take your freedom and make you lose your job. The thugs in blue are horrific. '
"You mean he can't be held responsible for things that are said on his official, verified Twitter account?  And he has no way to stop these tweets from happening?"
'On Monday the mainstream media reported that "Donald Trump shit in his pants".\n \nOn Tuesday the White House reports that "Donald Trump would never shit in his pants".\n \nOn Wednesday Donald Trump tweets "I shit my pants and I meant to do it."'
"Tell that to Donald Trump. He's the one that compared it to the soldiers. They went to prison. And the article on it uses jail and prison interchangeably https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/us-navy-sailor-jailed-for-taking-photos-of-classified-areas-of-nuclear-submarine"
'Well, according [to this article](https://www.dailywritingtips.com/jail-vs-prison/) (which is specifically meant for writers) the two are interchangeable as a colloquialism only.  Meaning that if you don\'t know any better then, by all means, feel free to use it.\n\n>When the words are used in reference to actual places of legal confinement, there is a distinct difference between a jail and a prison.\n\n>In most US states, jails are short-term facilities operated by local authorities, whereas prisons are long-term facilities operated by the state or federal government.\n\n>When people are arrested for anything, from drunk driving to murder, they will be temporarily confined in a jail. For lack of more appropriate facilities, mentally ill people are often placed in jail.\n\nThe article ends with the following admonishment:\n\n>Most speakers will probably continue to use jail informally to mean “a place of incarceration.” ***Professional writers, on the other hand, may be expected to observe a distinction between jail and prison in formal contexts.*** ^(emphasis mine)\n\nPlease keep in mind that the jail/prison differentiation is specific to the US.  If you are in the UK then the meanings are slightly different and jail is spelt "gaol".'
"You're so right! How could I be so blind?! Of course the campaign chairman, confidant and head hancho would know anything about the internal workings of the campaign! you're right, there is no possible way that Steve Bannon could ever know these things, Hes just a derange drunk nazi."
'Which is laughable.  I was in Turkey at Ataturk\'s airport hotel when the coup was happening. (Nothing like tanks shooting helicoptors outside of your hotel to make a vacation memorable.)  For ~8 hours, it was chaos.  Then bureaucratic control clamped down hard and it was slow, miserable, awful.  All this was during Eid, to boot.  It was a shitshow for all the Americans traveling through Istanbul at the time.  Took us four days to get out.  Ugh.\n\nNo, it\'s pretty clear that the "coup" was internally co-opted by Ertogan, used as a publicity stunt, and was way too well coordinated both in its execution and failure to have been done by someone on the other side of the planet. '
"It's funny how you say 'I'll base my opinions on facts' and then go into whatever the rest of that was. \n\n> there is no evidence of Russia's impact in our election at all\n\n None except multiple secret meetings that were denied and covered up, thousands of spam accounts originating from companies linked to RT, and heavily biased business interests and associations. \n\nWhat about the part where Jr specifically admitted someone approached claiming to have dirt on hrc, and he went ahead and met with them - but claimed they had no dirt? Doesn't the 1) being approached mean Russian associates might have actually attempted other avenues of undermining our election and 2) show that Jr at least was interested in entertaining such a lead?  If she 'did' have real information, are we to assume DJT Jr would have forwarded that information to the proper federal authorities, or simply walked away from it? "

'A person can make a terrible decision and be wrong while doing what they believe is right.  I would consider this to still be honorable.'
"no use in honor, Americans have all forgotten what honor is. Tweeting is honorable? covering for employment through political bias while you're suppose to be non partisan and independent? I mean, it's useless to talk cheaply like this, it's as if he's holding back something that he shouldn't have during those hearings? I mean, this looks a lot more worse than it does him standing up for himself right? I mean, why would anyone have too if you were right? Looks like when you no longer have authority and you've abused said authority, it's more helpful to attack the system you claim is honorable by blaming those monitoring you or others in a system watching itself for honor? lol who made the first move? If anything, Comey is a sell out. Comey wants to play drama with the networks for money while using subversion to answers questions that in an untimely manner; this hurts his credibility and it harms the FBI further and government as a whole. So much for the reality tv honor. I mean, people need to make money typing online for whatever outlet they have, so in a way, this doesn't matter at all until you're under oath, or if you've planned press briefings that hold no one accountable for violations that have been broken. I'm surprised Obama isn't complaining about getting attention at this point. It's all that's been watched for the last 8 years, he was never in distress but a few brief moments, while many American's were suffering deaths in communities he claimed he'd do better; there was no change, so I don't get how that guy even smiles. We never needed him. Nor new taxes that entitled people to abuse the law even further, and if it's all a fake excuse, why does it matter what's being said anyway?  "

Do your own research.\n\nhttp://observer.com/2015/08/the-countless-crimes-of-hillary-clinton-special-prosecutor-needed-now/\n\n\nAs Andy McCarthy explained it in the National Review:\n\n>In fact, the espionage act—which regulates the handling of intelligence by government officials — does not refer to classified information; it refers to information relating to the national defense. Moreover, it does not prohibit solely the transmission of such information; it criminalizes the communication, delivery, or transmission of that information; causing communication, delivery, or transmission of that information; permitting the removal of that information from its proper place of custody through gross negligence; permitting that information to be lost, stolen, abstracted, or destroyed through gross negligence; or, failing to make a prompt report to superiors in the government when an official knows that the information has been removed from its proper place of custody, communicated to someone not authorized to have it, lost, stolen, abstracted, or destroyed. See also Title 18 United States Code Section 2071 (prohibiting destruction of records).\n\nBut your gal just made a mistake I suppose? No, she is an evil, lying monster. \n\n'

'Multiple important things to take away.  \n\nNumber 1 this was done by OPR which is not part of the FBI but rather the DOJ WHICH is under Sessions.  \n2 McCabe believes he was targeted and smeared to loss credibility as a witness in Mueller s probe\n\nThis is incredibly petty to fire the man 18 months after the incident at 10 pm 2 days prior to his retirement. '
"I'm just glad they fired him instead of strangling him or poisoning him with either a nerve gas or polonium laced tea. "
"Or, maybe (maybe), he just sucked at his job? I don't know. I mean, getting cash for his wife's political career or ignoring clearly broken laws by a 'former candidate who shall not be named' or failing to followup on rules that were bent, broken or dismissed altogether because said law breaker had the same political leanings. No. Probably not. It must have been because he knows something about the Russians. Or, he could just be a douche nozzle that nobody liked. So hard to make sense of this. "
'Sessions bears a lot of the responsibility for this. Then again maybe his job was threatened if he didn’t fire him.  '
'FAKE NEWS: OPR (Office of Professional Responsibility) is part of the FBI, OPR is basically the FBI’s own internal affairs. But, yes if you are part of the FBI you are under the DOJ, there’s no hidng that one!\n\nYou also failed to mention the findings of the Obama appointed OIG inspector.'
'INAL, but would he really have a case? I know what the administration did was shitty and i am no trump fan. But what could McCabe sue for?'
"Dude, Trump didn't fire him. It is a little ridiculous getting down votes for stating something that is clearly fact based. Don't just ignore McCabe's nonsense because you dislike Trump. The guy was fired based on the findings of the Congressional Committee which had nothing to do with Trump. "
"I mean, clearly the AG or FBI Director could fire McCabe at any time.  The President has lambasted McCabe MANY times on Twitter.  At least in the eyes of the POTUS, there was ample reason to fire the guy months ago.  I just don't see why it had to wait until a politicized report was released by the HIC to do it.  The actions taken by Sessions and the White House just scream vindictiveness.  And now because of this, McCabe will sue the government for wrongful termination, costing taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more in legal fees.  From what I understand, McCain will eventually get a pension, but it won't be for another 10 years, and it's only ~$60k a year.  That's $600k in lost income for him.  How much will the federal government have to spend in legal fees defending their actions on firing him? "
'The publicly available document? \n\nWhoever fired him (not Trump according to you) had sufficient security clearance to access the House Intel findings long before the sanitized report became available.\n\nSo #logic: this guy is a major fraud, totally compromised, a disservice to the country, a black mark on the agency, a fool, a traitor...\n\nand we’ll hang on to him for awhile longer?'
'The House Intelligence Committee took a vote on whether to read the actual documents on which they claimed to base their “report.” Democrats voted for reading the documents. Republican majority voted against — the majority’s failure to read the underlying documents meant they knew nothing of the subject matter of their “report.” The screed that the Republican majority provided was basically a list of vague resentments based on lies, written by a moron who has no idea what he’s doing, besides carrying Trump’s jockstrap.  Google is your friend, too.'

'Comey isn’t a government employee any more, though, and has just as much right to despise and ridicule trump as we all do. I don’t see how tweeting quotations that go so far over trump’s head as to be invisible to him hurts Mueller’s investigation. '
'Don’t get me wrong, I’m no fan of Clinton. I voted for her while holding my nose, but Comey’s press release about the Clinton emails days before the election was appalling. \n\nI feel like we all forget his bungling of the Clinton investigation simply because he’s now an enemy of Trump. '
"This. Comeys tongue in cheek is an additional complaint his criticizers might make, but it's far from why he's being attacked. They would hate him and blame him regardless. These tweets don't add or remove legitimacy to his or their claims. Specifically because it all can be attributed to the firing more than any political bias. "

Whether a court/Congress would believe that to be reasonable doubt is questionable. It's the same reason that Trump's admission on live TV that he fired Comey because of Russia can have reasonable doubt. \n\n"
'I do not normally watch Fox News, but the local channel broadcasts it. The TV was left on today, and they were talking about this.

Can they be that dumb?   If Flynn is testifying, heads are gonna roll, full stop.  Which head(s) exactly, remains to be seen.'

Even if Trump is gone, we have a sizable population of people that are fiercely loyal to Trump as a person, as well as his tactics and political philosophy. That is a major problem. The institutions, checks and balances  and civil order that our nation is founded upon is under attack - removing a President will not shore up the systematic framework of the nation; it will still be on fire.\n\nAbraham Lincoln\'s Lyceum Address has been echoing in my head during the election and throughout Trump\'s first year in office:\n\n> "Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow? Never! All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not by force take a drink from the Ohio or make a track on the Blue Ridge in a trial of a thousand years. At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer. If it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us; it cannot come from abroad. **If destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen we must live through all time or die by suicide.**"\n\nLets hope we are able to recover, both institutionally as well as a community of people, from the divide that we find ourselves in currently.'
"Caligula?  Why's that?  From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula#Scandals):\n\n> Philo of Alexandria and Seneca the Younger describe Caligula as an insane emperor who was self-absorbed, angry, killed on a whim, and indulged in too much spending and sex.[102] He is accused of sleeping with other men's wives and bragging about it,[103] killing for mere amusement,[104] deliberately wasting money on his bridge, causing starvation,[105] and wanting a statue of himself erected in the Temple of Jerusalem for his worship.[98] **Once, at some games at which he was presiding, he ordered his guards to throw an entire section of the audience into the arena during the intermission to be eaten by the wild beasts because there were no prisoners to be used and he was bored.**"
'I had a Western Civs history professor that, after covering the fall of the Roman Empire made it clear that he believed that we were experiencing the American analog to the [Pax Romana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Romana) (the Pax Americana, if you will) and that America would likely suffer the same problems and was destined for a decline, or worse, and would follow in the footsteps of the Roman Empire.\n\nAlways found that to be really interesting.\n\nEDIT: link'

'I think Trump/Faux news supporters are over saturated with propaganda that they can\'t think for themselves. Even when faced with all the allegations and crimes against Trump, they vehemently deny any wrong doing and victim blame or yell they were "crisis actors". It\'s sickening to think there is an entire population of people that function in our everyday lives like this. I have the misfortune of being related to one of these buffoons and no matter how much evidence is against Trump they will not relent. I\'m not one to put someone on my side, but this is becoming Orwellian "newspeak" in real time.'
"they're not super smart, the people are just super stupid"
'I’ve pretty much given up on trying to convince them of anything. When I do talk to them about it, they would just recite another bullshit headline about the subject they heard from Sean Hannity or Alex Jones. then quickly change the subject to another made up story in attempt not to talk about the first issue... \n\nAnd when really pressed with facts and logic, they would either get super pissed and start with the name calling and and tough guy act, or they claim they don’t wanna talk politics because they don’t wanna ruin the relationship... '
'They victim blame the sexual assault allegations. "If they were so innocent why are they now speaking out?" They believe Trump is a smart business man regardless of any evidence proving otherwise. I mentioned all the failed Trump businesses and facts that the only people that would give him money were shady Russian banks like VEB or Deutche. They don\'t care. I even got into an argument about the economy. I said by removing the bank regulations that will entitle them to make riskier investments and cause more problems just like they did in 2008, and we all know what happened there. It went something like this: \n\nHim: Oh just because he declared bankruptcy 6 times you think he\'s unsuccessful?\nMe: I\'d be successful too if my dad gave me a fortune and I squandered it on a bunch of failed businesses and declared bankruptcy to keep it until the bank seizes the assets. \nHim: Oh so just because YOU think China is going to start a trade war and Nafta it\'s going to screw the economy?\nMe: Yes, exactly why would you try to screw the economy by starting a tariff war? And not to mention alienate your neighbor to the south and one of the biggest traders to the US. \nHim: *ANGRY stare* Trudges off and leaves. '

'No that is why mueller and co will catch them. All anyone needs is a list of the contradictions they spout weekly to make the case. Was Cohen in Prague or not? Was the trump tower meeting about adoptions or not? Did they know Flynn was an unregistered foreign agent and when did they find out? All of these are things they brought upon themselves because they’re stupid. '
'>James Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a Special Council?\n\nThat is a completely false statement. It is 100% wrong. The special council was appointed because comey was fired, and sessions had ethical conflicts of interest. The investigation that mueller took over had started months prior. \n\n>Therefore, the Special Council was established based on an illegal act\n\nFirst of all, he “leaked” after the special council was appointed. Trump said himself that he fired him because of the Russia investigation and Flynn. Second, there’s nothing illegal about recounting a conversation. It’s not classified or privileged just because it’s with the president. There were no laws broken here. \n\n>Really, does everybody know what that means?\n\nThe rant of a desperate old man who isn’t mentally equipped to deal with a normal job let alone the presidency AND all of the metaphorical alligators that are closing in on him. He’s unraveling. \n\nIn all seriousness, how is a quote from trump your answer? If we were talking about OJ Simpson, would you post a quote from him proclaiming his innocence? How painfully stupid are you?'

'The "deep state" is a fabricated buzzword designed by America\'s enemies to turn their own people against the very people who have sworn to defend them. They (the intelligence community) have oversight, accountability, and leadership, they are not guaranteed their position and, like McCabe, can be fired if found there is reason to do so. They\'re not immortal, or untouchable, but they have an important job that they must be allowed to continue to do.\n\nRepeated in echo chambers, the "Deep State" is used as a scapegoat and the center of conspiracy theories in an effort to use the gullible trump supporters to weaken the system of checks and balances put in place to insure that no one person or party in America amasses enough power to become a Tyrant. While simultaneously drawing away from the actual conspiracy, that Trump is a Traitorous puppet and Putin is his master.\n\nAnd I think for the first time, that conspiracy is being shown the sunlight it so greatly deserves.\n\nEDIT: Just to be clear, there is no deep state, it just exists in your head.\n'

'I’m not a republican or indeed an American, but the headline here is inaccurate. Giuliani is saying that Trump fired Comey because he didn’t *make it public* that he wasn’t being investigated as part of the Russian probe. \n\nComey’s own memos confirm that he *did* tell Trump that privately, and that Trump was annoyed with him for not publicly announcing that to ease the bad publicity he was getting. Giuliani’s remarks here are consistent with that.'

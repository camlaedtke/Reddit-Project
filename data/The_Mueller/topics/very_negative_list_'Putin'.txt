12 Russian intelligence agents were just charged with attacking the US, Trump directly encouraged that attack, Trump directly benefitted from that attack. And Trump just blamed it all on us, on his way to a private meeting with Putin. This is the Republican party. They hate America.
Trump stopping "war games" with South Korea was Putin's idea
Trump saw evidence that Putin personally ordered the attack on US elections even BEFORE he was inaugurated. He knew each time he tried to deflect blame away from them. He knew when he invited Lavrov to the Oval Office. He knew when he fired Comey. He fucking knew.
Putin targets Florida (and Mar-a-Lago) in mock nuclear attack. Trump courageously responds by insulting actor Alec Baldwin.
Putin’s comrades at the_Donald come out in force to defend Russia, attack the U.K. and EU after the U.S. expels Russian diplomats.
"And why does this lazy asswipe Mueller still do nothing to stop Trump?  Receiving a letter from a foreign leader is treason that should be an easy death conviction if Mueller wasn't such a Trump cocksucker."
"Putin's no dummy, and compared to Trump, he's Einstein on brain roids, but let's not get carried away here. His two main strategies are 1) hire trolls to spread lies on the internet, and 2) hire people to poison everyone you don't like. It doesn't take a genius to come up with stuff like that."
"We like to think that Russia is the sole reason we're in this shit cuz it's a more appealing alternative to the thought that this shit wouldn't have happened if our inept politicians hadn't sold us out over and over. \n\nRussia has a hand in this, but that's expected of them. What's also expected is that our politicians push and fight back, yet they open the door for Russia with smiles hidden behind masks of worry and pockets lined with as much of our money that they could carry. Don't fall for the Russian scare tactic, there are more urgent wars at our home fronts than abroad."
"You're right. I don't see what this nothingburger is all about. \n\nIts hard for me to see any Trump ties to Russia—I mean, except for the Flynn thing and the Manafort thing and the Tillerson thing and the Sessions thing and the Kushner thing and the Wray thing and the Morgan, Lewis, & Bockius “Russian Law Firm of the Year” thing and the Carter Page thing and the Roger Stone thing and the 198 Million voter records thing and the Felix Sater thing and the Boris Ephsteyn thing and the Rosneft thing and the Gazprom thing and the Sergey Gorkov banker thing and the Azerbajain thing and the “I love Putin” thing and the Donald Trump, Jr. thing and the Lavrov thing and the Sergey Kislyak thing and the Oval Office thing and the Gingrich/Kislyak phone calls thing and the Russian Business Interests thing and the Emoluments Clause thing and the Alex Schnaider thing and the hack of the DNC thing and the Guccifer 2.0 thing and the Mike Pence “I don’t know anything” thing and the Russians mysteriously dying thing and Trump’s public request to Russia to hack Hillary’s email thing and the Trump house sale for $100 million at the bottom of the housing bust to the Russian fertilizer king thing and the Russian fertilizer king’s plane showing up in Concord, NC during Trump rally campaign thing and the Nunes sudden flight to the White House in the night thing and the Nunes personal investments in the Russian winery thing and the Cyprus bank thing and Trump not releasing his tax returns thing and the Republican Party’s rejection of an amendment to require Trump to show his taxes thing and the election hacking thing and the GOP platform change to the Ukraine thing and the Steele Dossier thing and the Sally Yates can’t testify thing and the intelligence community’s investigative reports thing and the Trump reassurance that the Russian connection is all “fake news” thing and the Chaffetz not willing to start an investigation thing and the Chaffetz suddenly deciding to go back to private life in the middle of an investigation thing and the appointment of Pam Bondi who was bribed by Trump in the Trump University scandal appointed to head the investigation thing and the alfa-bank thing and the VEB thing and the The White House going into full-on cover-up mode, refusing to turn over the documents related to the hiring and subsequent firing of Flynn thing and the Chaffetz and White House blaming the poor vetting of Flynn on Obama thing and the Poland and British intelligence gave information regarding the hacking back in 2015 to Paul Ryan and he \\didn't do anything thing and the Agent M16 following the money thing and the Trump team KNEW about Flynn's involvement but hired him anyway thing and the let’s fire Comey thing and the Mueller let’s fire him too thing and the Election night Russian trademark gifts thing and the Russian diplomatic compound electronic equipment destruction thing and the let’s give back the diplomatic compounds to the Russians thing and the let’s back away from Cuba thing and the donny Jr met with Russians thing and Trump's secret second meeting with his boss Putin thing and the Steve Bannon telling the world the Trump Tower meeting was “treasonous” thing or the Russian Oligarchs attending his inauguration thing or the Alex Van Der Zwaan indictment or the Rick Gates plea deal thing or Hope Hicks resigning after congressional testimony thing or even the Erik Prince Seychelles back channel to Russia thing.\n\nTotal crazy conspiracy theory."
'If they do a joint press conference and Kim Jung Un speaks more eloquently in english than Trump I am going to lose my shit. '

'FUCK TRUMP.\n\nFUCK PUTIN.\n\nFUCK THE GOP.\n\nFUCK THEIR SUPPORTERS.\n\n*Aiding and abetting traitors is also treason, and is punishable by Death.*'
'Interesting how the headline, *Did Putin give Trump the idea to stop “war games” with South Korea?*, a question, suddenly becomes a definitive statement; Trump stopping "war games" with South Korea **was Putin\'s idea**. I mean, come on. That\'s just dirty misdirection on your part, Zelda. '
'At this point he seems like he is literally saying this just to angry us. Russia is saying to everyone to not support american soldiers or america and Trump is defending them all day.\n\nA) he is even more stupid that I initially believed\n\nB) Like I said, he just mentions russia to make us angry'
'No shit. '
"It's only punishable by death in wartime. You have to be found aiding and abetting an organization that is using physical force against the government and/or its citizens. (established in U.S. v. Burr)"
"I don't care that Trump thinks he kicked ass. He's always been a narcissistic moron. The bigger problem is that millions of Americans think he kicked ass. "
"I think you're delusional\n\nEDIT: Not a trump supporter but damn this sub is not what I thought it was, it's driven by mob mentality like t_d. Sad, I'm out. "
'How in the flying fuck can 1/3 of America be behind this shit?  They must not read about History.  The parallels to Nazi Germany are downright terrifying and the crazy thing is that most of his supporters are going to be the first line of the population that could be affected if he continues on this path.  '
'Just a quick peek through your history and most of what I see is anti-Obama, anti-Bernie rhetoric and you defend Putin in another post. Other posts to /r/communism and other alt-right nonsense. \n\nEveryone has the right to their own opinion but intentional ignorance is foolish at best and even dangerous in other circumstances. \n\nWhat happened to you since those steak posts from before the election?'
"I'm scared he's not. \n\nLike probably never going to happen, but this timeline is already crazy enough. "
">he has treated the people poorly. Has threatened many countries including ours with nuclear attack. Is anything he has done excusable probably not. Is this what he was raised with yes.\n\nAre you talking about Kim or Trump?  \n\n\nYou don't get it because conservatives don't understand what context is or how it works."
"He's fucked"
'If you\'re a lawyer and you get conracted about a lead story like this which is about to put your client into a world of shit, I think the stupidest thing you could say is "can\'t talk. in a meeting". \n\nwhat kind of meeting would that be, fuckface? are some shitty Russian entrepreneurs trying to show you their gangbang fleshlights for your client to use while in prison?'
'Trump could walk down 5th ave and kill someone and it wouldn’t matter.  In fact, people can kill kids in schools every week and it wont  matter.  No one is going to save us and the cavalry isn’t coming.\n\nUnless we all vote.'
'WUT HE IS IN TOWN!!!??? I am so jealous rn. How was it!? '
'No, it’s only illegal if the legally warranted wiretap transmits directly to a wrist watch listening device like that Dick Tracy wristwatch phone. '

'Put this on /r/conspiracy.   I would but I got banned for being too anti trump.  :('
'No shit, this is a story because trump denies it, not because anybody is particularly surprised that Putin wanted his sock puppet.'
'But I thought Hillary colluded with Russia to sell Uranium? Why would she want to goto war with them?'
">Repeating the same thing twice doesn't really imply he's answering both questions one after another...\n\nI was more referring the fact that the translator ignored the part where he said “Yes, I did want Trump to win”, simplifying it down to a simple “Yes”.\n\nAlso, just to clarify, I am by no means attempting to redeem or defend Putin here. I simply want to avoid truth being based on misinformation. Modifying translations in order to push an agenda only serves to undermine the position of those attempting to bring criminals to justice.\n\nEdit: a word"
'It\'s irrelevant what the rest of it was, it was a political bait, that he obviously never answered, and never in fucking seven hells would touch to answer.\n\nBut hey, keep stirring drama out of nothing. I don\'t know what you base your "weaker" than ever on, as far as I know you\'re spending more money on war than ever, as well as your collective market caps of various companies like apple and amazon are reaching biblical numbers. I guess your president isn\'t very good at the whole twitter and public image thing? Sucks that THAT is what matters so much to you, LOL. A nation of idiots who must have an enemy somewhere far away to not kill each other at schools, honestly. You\'re the jokes who deserve their president. He is the ultimate image of yourselves.\n\nYou get one president who\'s solution to war is more war, and solution to economic crisis is printing a metric shit ton of currency out of thin air and giving it out to gamblers at 0% interest, and you praise the guy. Like he\'s the best thing that happened to you. You get some next idiot, who\'s just as shit at actually ruling, and only ever does what he\'s told by his advisers and campaign contributors, like the previous one, but GOD DAMN he\'s bad at public image sharades, and holy shit it\'s like you\'re gona go to war with each other. This is the reality of politics across the entire globe. Presidents and ministers, aren\'t exactly the kings of old who rule everything and everyone. They fucking depend on a whole lot of fucking people. And often these people\'s interests are put first, usually it\'s the elite or corporate. Get out of your bedroom at some point.'
"Putin's body language when Trump said he believes nothing went wrong about meddling with the elction was incredible to watch. I think Putin really had to fight damn hard not to laugh out loud. Look how he pressed together his lips and played with his hands. "
'One really has to wonder what is Chief of Staff Kelly going to do now? Seriously, at some point he has to put country over party/administration this is beyond sad, anger, shock, no more words to put next to this waste of human skin.'
">Here ready to fucking vote the fucker out...\n\nThe problem is the Russians will continue to meddle in the upcoming election. So, who the fuck knows if they will succeed. Benedict Trump has clearly expressed that he will do nothing about the rigged elections... so, there's a chance the Russians will succeee in interfering. \n\nIf the Dems don't win the majority in the upcoming mid-terms, this nation is Fucked... beyond fucked. The GOP and the Treasonous Trump will get even more emboldened than they are already. "
'It’s not just the CIA. There’s not one intelligence agency (and there’s a lot) that deny Russia interfered in our election. '
"Trump must be guilty as fuck then. The guy can't shut the fuck up for a second."
"Then let's see the list of all the times the US has been proven to meddle in foreign elections.\n\nYou say there are 81 times, but where's the data to back that up?\n\nAnd before you say I'm attacking your point, this is a genuine request."
'Whoah, Putin accused one of his critics of single-handedly providing a full third of Hillary Clinton’s campaign budget? Well, that’s totally trustworthy!\n\nAnyone who votes down this dumb comment is doing it because they’re brain ashes Vick’s and not because you clearly have no grasp of what $400,000,000 is.'

'its not the time to be fair. We can be fair about that once we savage the GOP and Trump. Deal with the big problems first, then we can address the piss ants int he democratic party as they are not actually a clear and present danger to the american people.'
"That is the thing that baffles me. My parents were adament about not excluding anyone because of their race or their back ground. And if any man spoke about me the way Cheeto spoke about women they would be shot with rock salt.  If his boss cheated him out  of paychecks like Cheeto did my  father would be livid. Cheeto does not deserve anyone's respect. The position of president deserves respect but if the person sitting in power is a traitor or horrible human they do not deserve the respect."
'I’m skeptical of everything. I wonder what they are partaking in that causes them to ignore reality. I also wonder if I’m wrong '
'When the Democrats take the House in the mid-terms the orange idiot will be saying . . . see I told you, Russian collusion!!!!!!'

'Half?  There would still be enough remaining for a ten -part miniseries.  Even then the majority would be an incredulous mass of stupid evil that makes a Bond villain monologue seem like Shakespeare. '
"The video is not doctored; that's what caused the problem in the first place. Listen to the video. The volume is coming from the right audio channel; the first part of the question is on the left audio channel. (that's what confused everyone in the first place). It switches as Putin puts the earpiece into his ear."
'The Republicans have been fighting against the US democracy for ages.\n\n- 2010 Red Map gerrymandering\n- Citizens United\n- Voter ID laws\n- Denying voting rights to felons / ex-felons\n- Voter registry purges\n- Removing polling stations\n- etc.\n\nRepublicans actively work to destroy democracy in the US. \n\nThey are exactly the kind of political party George Washington warned us against in his Farewell Address.'

Russia wants to prop up ultra-nationalist and neo-nazi movements because it will fragement Europe.  \n\n\nA fragmented and/or Europe in disarray can't put up sanctions, can't stop energy deals, can't check Russias very limited power.

'Also, from what I saw in other threads he apparently thought no one knew about it and tried to keep it under wraps, but the Kremlin was going to let people know so they leaked the story? Or some shit like that. Trump is literally the most guilty person I\'ve ever seen in my life and there are still people out there going "naawww" in total delusion. '
"Far worse than stupid.  He's a craven traitor."
"That's Trump's aspiration, to be able to rig an election all by himself. Not something he sees as a bad thing. "
'"Obama hated world peace."  "Obama breathes out carbon dioxide which adds to global warming."'
"It's even worse. He's such a cunt even if he'd accidentally do the right thing I'd consider it wrong just because he did it. Am I biased? Oh fuck yes, regarding that idiot I am"
"Here's an article about one of the quotes (which in the image is attributed to Don Jr but should have been attributed to Eric, as others in the thread have pointed out):\nhttp://www.wbur.org/onlyagame/2017/05/05/james-dodson-donald-trump-golf\nIt happened back in August 2013 during a conversation with golf writer James Dodson. There is no recording of the conversation, so we have to take Dodson's word for it. Eric Trump denied he said any of it. \nI believe Dodson but I thought everyone should know the full details."
"Really unfortunate this wasn't recorded. But considering how specific these quotes are, it would be very hard for them to claim that it was taken out of context. That whole family needs to be branded for the traitors they are."
'Well turns out the quotes are reversed which will just be used to discredit it. I understand that may not matter much to most of us here but it’s important to be factual. All the other side would have to say is it’s wrong, it’s fake news they never said that. '

'Thee are strict rules on foreign involvement in domestic campaign including contributions to campaigns. Laundering the money through an attorney, if proven, is a serious breach and not just a fine but jail time.. And its not just one instance, after receiving the money, if it\'s deemed an illegal contribution every instance he uses the illegal money, is a separate violation. While in most cases, sentences are usually concurrent, but egregious violations can be stacked, which means it could be 10+ years of "tape my butt shut" Federal Prison'
"Trump fucked a lot of women. Many of  whom sought to have their sordid stories made public after Donnie Moscow won the GOP nomination, likely for the money they'd get from the tabloids and the like.  Stormy Daniels is one such woman. To prevent these stories from coming out, Donnie instructed his personal attorney to pay them hush money and sign NDAs to enforce their silence in the months before the election in 2016. That attorney was Cohen. But Donnie Moscow doesn't have much cash lying around, because he's massively in debt to a number of foreign investors (aka leveraged). These investors are mostly Russian oligarchs. So when it comes time to pay that hush money, Donnie has to ask his investors for a little more cash. Cohen goes to Prague to talk to the oligarchs and makes the ask. They comply, and Cohen gets the money. Cohen pays the women. \n\nTLDR; Donnie Moscow used Russian money to pay off porn stars he fucked while the first lady was pregnant with Baron Trump. Yup, it's that salacious. "
'They both suck. \n\nThis election cycle was a bad one. '
'That\'s whats been said, but new information contradicts that. (Trump paying Cohen back)  The violations accrue to Cohen, every time he uses that "tainted money" so if he made payments to Stormy Daniels using that money, its a violation, but also a violation every time he paid out money, that can be established coming from those funds, to pay for things were campaign related or otherwise restricted from doing so.'

But that didn\'t give me the excuse to grab my dad\'s hunting guns and go hog-wild.\n\nYeah, I see your T_D post history.\n\nIf you expect us to believe that T_D cares about bullied kids, you got another thing coming. You\'re the ones out there every day saying people get offended too easily, are "soyboys", cucks, need to toughen up, snowflakes, etc, etc. Don\'t see you giving a shit about all the gay kids getting bullied, the Hispanic kids getting chanted at ("Build the wall!

"The issue is that you supposed evidence when there really isn't any.\n\n13 trolls with a 100,000 advertising budget is toothless. If there is anything worse, we'll have to wait and see, but so far it's been way too much cry wolf. People have Russia fatigue and at this point it really just seems like a desperate way to smear Trump's election as illegitimate.\n\n\nI was banned back in the early days when the sub was first started, but I was a die hard Bernie fan at that point and I think I said something inflammatory.\nYou probably can message the mods and ask for a probationary un-banning, if you want.

The fact trump insults everyone except Russia (any reasonable man would start distancing himself to dispel the rumour, but instead trump has decided to invite him to the White House, just after he attacked Uk with chemicals)\n\n10. Trump has borrowed money from Russians for years (which isn\'t a problem in itself but is strange when you add that with the fact he won\'t say anything bad about Russia.) \n\n11. The fact that instead of helping end the "witch hunt" he decides to tweet all day about no collusion and witch hunt and how there conflict of interest.. hmm very innocent behaviour.\n\nNow That is literally proof that Russia atleast tried to influence the election which is what I was banned for saying.\n\nNow considering the fact the Donald post I commented on was about how England influenced the election (with no evidence to support the claim) and that post was allowed to stay, but my comment about Russia was blocked straight away....'
'This is exactly what I expect.  But, I also think this is what will happen 1. If he loses reelection or 2. When his two terms are up.  Trumps rube shitbags will absolutely start a massive civil conflict when he leaves office, under any circumstances.  They have completely lost touch with reality.'
'Or is he retiring because he’s about to be spending full time with his lawyers? This looks more and more like a wave of conspiracy charges are coming. All these republicans knew about things that they now understand are being prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. If you know a crime is going to be committed or is being committed and do nothing, you can be charged with conspiracy to commit said crime.'
'No they won’t, they’ll cry about it on the forums and talk about how they are locked and loaded. But they won’t do anything because they have a lot to lose. They’re home, job, or lives are not actually worth that man, they just like that he “sticks it to those cuck libs.”\nThat’s not enough to foment violent revolution. When people are starving in the streets, that’s when violent civil revolt happens, when people have literally nothing to lose.'
"It really does seem to be the end goal of his megaphoning conspiracies into their ears. No matter the outcome for him, it will undoubtedly be someone else's fault. If he's impeached, a rigged congress that's propped up by crooked dems. If he loses an election, a rigged process stolen by vengeful Hillary shills. I don't see any path where he doesn't get to use his malice and delusions in a vengeful way. "
"That doesnt mean there isnt going to be violence though. The media keeps going on about it being the end of the world. A lot of delusional people have access to guns. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw more shootings/massacres.\n\nIt's disgusting to me that this violence has become so normalized that I can speak of this nonchalantly"

'Please Director Mueller do something about these treasonous bastards.  I want to believe that our Republic can still work.'
"There might be a different perspective to take on this issue. One would be that Putin thinks his plan to buy the White House and install his own crony have failed. Anti-russian sentiments have only been increasing and something like this would exacerbate that problem. This would be like Putin's Plan B - if you can't make money off of it, then just place a bomb at the center of it to cause chaos. In a metaphorical sense, the bomb here is Americans losing faith in their own government. Anything that weakens American strength abroad is good for Russia."
'Where in deed...\n\nLet me just go to the fox news website and see how they are twisting this. \n\nWhat!?! Strange, they don\'t even have an article on it on the front page.

'A repeal of environmental regulation rules that prevented private land developers and coal factories from dumping in/contaminating bodies of water and threatening the climate.  I disagree with this act because it puts the interest of corporations above the preservation of the environment and the people, and will potentially have a very negative impact on the climate.  It also indicates a disinterest of the current administration in clean, renewable energy. I\'m not super interested in having a political debate with someone over reddit so I\'m going to just leave it at the "one" act you asked for (technically the water and climate ordeals were two separate executive orders so make that double).'
"There is no death pentaly for drug dealers. Israel armed teachers in 1970s only 2 msas school shootings since.

Why not Israel has one Mexico has one China has one Costa Rica has one North Korea has one, why can't the USA ? The wall would also stop some drug smuggling not all but some. He didn't pick everyone just key pieces like general mattis for example, if someone working under a long chain of command fucks up we blame Trump ? So a mcdonalds manager sells drugs out of mcdonalds should we arrested and implicate the ceo owners etc ?\n\nOk if Trump is Putin's puppet what has he done for Russian ? I can't believe u seriously believe he's a puppet,having the president as a puppet wouldn't even be efficient since he only has 33% control. So what ur saying is putin has puppet in Senate doj and the house too ?

"When Putin intervened to save Assad in Syria he claimed it was to protect Syria's sovereignty by combating sub-state militant groups that were in control of Syrian/Iraqi military armor and weapons.\n\nIt established a supply line using it's navy and commercial ships, sending tons of supplies including heavy weapons like T90 tanks to supposedly replenish Assad's SAA. The first batch of these tanks immediately ended up in control of Iran's sectarian militant groups in Syria like [Hezbollah](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdhC_WXW0AAPKMa.jpg) and [Asaib ahl Al-haq](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdcQgPDWwAAhid3.jpg).\n\nThese groups joined in with Kremlin & it's own paramilitary forces in joint offensives, including attacks against U.S. forces and it's allies. One of these attacks was a [spectacular failure](http://www.newsweek.com/total-f-russian-mercenaries-syria-lament-us-strike-killed-dozens-818073) due to Ru MoD leaving it's un-official military out to dry.\n\nRussia armed and joined in logistically with forces that attacked the U.S. and it's allies. Trump wants us to betray our troops and our allies who have already faced down the type of threat that Russia said it was intervening to stop, but went on to provoke and promote."

Women who fuck anyone and everyone and then post their escapades online are given TV shows and millions of dollars, effectively given those people a larger voice in the world community - and we wonder why America is sick.\n\nUnnecessary aggression to other countries because it generates cash flow, and Americans pat themselves on the back demanding they are heroes for the shit they have done.\n\nPeople who cry about not being able to find a job, when realistically they aren\'t willing to take whatever job is available and work their way up.\n\nWomen who use their sexuality as a weapon to lure men in and then take their resources because - as Michelle Williams put it: that is just what women do.\n\nMen who scream they are \'Alpha\', taking a page from a junior high playbook because they think that is what women want.  \n\nIntegrity is like a fuel tank: and Americans have wasted all of their fuel years ago in favor of keeping up with the Jones\'s because heaven forbid that they actually seek their personal truth rather than keep up appearances.\n\nIn America, cruelty is cool.  Being horrible to others in person and online is the name of the game, and then when tragedy strikes?  Just post a thoughts and prayers type post on social media and feel good for an hour, but hell if they will actually do anything about what they say.\n\nTrump IS America.  Yeah, the election was compromised but Americans love the drama.  They won\'t actually DO anything about it because why should they?  It isn\'t there job to do anything about it and besides they have social media to attend to!\n\nWhere Trump and his family should be dragged out into the street and beaten to death for their crimes against humanity (Children in cages?

Trump displays all of the characteristics you hold so dear.\n\nDon\'t believe me?  Then why is he your leader?  Why is he still in power?  You won\'t do anything but post horseshit here,  because it is a fact:\n\nYou are nothing but talk.  You are handicapped in all ways, and you will never make change.

'I\'m starting to think this as well. From Dump\'s and his followers viewpoint, the pee tape, if it does indeed exist, can easily be defended and like what gnorn said, as long as it was consensual, his base will eat it up. Like so many other stories and scandals, he\' ll just play the waiting game and after a few months or so, newer scandals and stories will have overshadowed it.\n\nBut underage girls, now that\'s something else as it\'s actually illegal. There\'s nothing illegal about having girls pee on a bed or on yourself. These are always the first points that Dump\'s followers bring up. Well, is it illegal? they\'d ask. And usually, it would be NO, there is no criminal law saying that it is. But having sex with underage girls, now that\'s a different story. Again, he could argue that those "underage" girls were legal in Russia or that he was "told" by many people that they were. You start to notice a pattern with this moron. He always likes to deflect blame away from himself and so he concocts these ideas in his head that "many people" told him so and so. And so by doing that, he thinks he\'s free of blame.\n\nBut either way, it has to be much bigger than just normal pee tapes to get this narcissist person so scared.'

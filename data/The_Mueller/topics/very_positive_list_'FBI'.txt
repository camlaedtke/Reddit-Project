"Trump. Pence would be a run of the mill republican who might try to push through some weird social conservative shit, but he will still act within the confines of the law and our democracy. The damage Pence could accomplish is akin to that of George W. Bush.\n\nTrump is an outlier that we've never seen before in our lifetimes. He doesn't value democracy or even try to pander to it. Democracy is the government for the common man. Someone who is born into riches has no need for democracy. They can buy the best lawyers, the best health care, they can influence those in power. Not all people born into money devalue democracy, but Trump certainly does. He views it as a chore, a road block to getting things done quickly. Try and find one speech where Trump even mentions the word 'democracy.' I'm sure they're out there, I'm sure you could count on one hand the amount of times.\n\nSomeone who values western democracy and our institutions wouldn't attack the press, the FBI, the judiciary, the intelligence community. They wouldn't cozy up to foreign despots while handing 'bills' to our allies for perceived money owed. They wouldn't suggest taking people's guns and dealing with due process later.\n\nTrump is far more dangerous because if he had it his way he would be president for life. And when he died maybe Ivanka or Jared would take over. Then maybe Baron. And Baron's children. And when you throw someone like that into the most powerful position in the world during a time of extreme economic hardship between the great recession and increased automation taking jobs, people are less inclined to question him because 'he's getting stuff done.' Or at least that's the perception."

If you refuse to comply, you give ammunition to your political enemies to keep it alive, you give tacit endorsement - inadvertently or not - for loyal staff to lie under oath, you potentially open yourself to charges of obstruction, and pretty much admit to the electorate that you have something to hide. \n\nInstead, you get out in front of it, you give no one any reasonable excuse to paint you as hiding anything, you make sure the investigation concludes with bipartisan agreement so that you get it behind you. If you play your cards right, you may even get a bump in your approval. \n\nBut that's if you're innocent and halfway smart, not President Donald J. Trump. "

If asked, the only thing the President should say is something like "I look forward to the conclusion of the investigation so that we may dedicate our attention entirely to the business of the nation," or direct them to White House counsel.\n\nAfter a month or two, it would be a good idea to have surrogates and party allies hitting those or similar talking points. Political pressure should negatively correlate public interest. As people begin to lose interest, the investigation can begin to be painted as a partisan waste of resources. \n\n'

The House and Senate Congressional campaign committees have at least $7.35 million in raised and spent money that was distributed to Nunes and others Rs that got laundered through a Russian American.\n\nThere's also post-Trump candidacy contributions that was laundered money through the NRA from Russian oligarchs.  \n\nTo be clear, any money or in-kind contributions (services, material donations) by a foreign agent to a federal, state, or local campaign is illegal.  An example of an in-kind contribution would be the research, set up, and operation of a troll farm for the covert support of a candidate or a third party hacker similar to a WikiLeaks that asks say, Russian intermediaries, to meet with the staff of a favored campaign to let them know they had the goods on their opposition."

'> Not a "Trumpian" but the flip side is, any other person on the planet would be in jail or have lost their security clearance had they handled classified material the way in which clinton and her team did.\n\nHere\'s the portion of the FBI investigation press release at the conclusion of the investigation dealing with their recommendation to the DoJ, emphasis added:\n\n> In our system, the prosecutors make the decisions about whether charges are appropriate based on evidence the FBI has helped collect. Although we don’t normally make public our recommendations to the prosecutors, we frequently make recommendations and engage in productive conversations with prosecutors about what resolution may be appropriate, given the evidence. In this case, given the importance of the matter, I think unusual transparency is in order.\n\n> Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before bringing charges. There are obvious considerations, like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent. Responsible decisions also consider the context of a person’s actions, and how similar situations have been handled in the past.\n\n> In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. **All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here.**\n\n> To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions. But that is not what we are deciding now.\n\n> As a result, although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case.\n\n> I know there will be intense public debate in the wake of this recommendation, as there was throughout this investigation. What I can assure the American people is that this investigation was done competently, honestly, and independently. No outside influence of any kind was brought to bear.\n\n> I know there were many opinions expressed by people who were not part of the investigation—including people in government—but none of that mattered to us. Opinions are irrelevant, and they were all uninformed by insight into our investigation, because we did the investigation the right way. Only facts matter, and the FBI found them here in an entirely apolitical and professional way. I couldn’t be prouder to be part of this organization.'

Suddenly for no reason, right around the time Eric Trump tweeted that the Trump Organization was flush with Russian cash they began buying up golf courses and property all across the globe. With cash. Which even if you have the cash you don't do. You only use a little bit of your money and use loans for everything else. But Trump suddenly started buying bad investments with cash.

'To set precedence.  The smaller ones can’t defend themselves.  I’ve been on YouTube for a while and have seen the shift from homegrown content providers to legency providers like ABC, NBC, Fox, etc.  They seem to be paying to have their content pushed to the top squeezing out the smaller ones.  It is a shame because the indies were not beholden to large corporate advertisers.  They have gone after the big ones as well like PewDiePie.  What they do is demonetize their content during the first few days of posting, it gets reviewed and put back on but the views have already happened.  This happened to H3H3 as well, some are jumping ship.  YouTube is slowing becoming another cable network.  '

I don’t really care if you spam it, just show him the truth. '
'The problem is the truth doesn’t matter anymore; it’s about competing narratives. Trump will continue to lie and offer an alternate version of reality to appease his base. That’s really all that matters to him now- keeping his base on his side, and if you look at the polls, he has been very successful even after Helsinki he still has 70% approval among Republicans. Trump will continue to undermine the truth and our democracy to keep himself in power including firing Mueller, installing a sympathetic Justice who will side with him when he postpones the 2020 election. Trump only cares about himself; he has no moral character or sense of duty towards his country. It will take a massive populist movement to oust him; similar to what happens on dictatorships. '
"So it comes down to this:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTrump is absolutely, literally, without a doubt, a complete idiot who is so narcissistic and greedy and corrupt and oblivious that he hasn't got a clue that he was suddenly hoisted to the presidency fraudulently by russian spy ring, and doesn't care because he truly believes it's an honest win and he's a legitimate president, and putin's got his back - he's a good old dude...\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOR\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe's a corrupt, narcissistic piece of shit who has been dirty dealing with russians for decades, to whom he owes his true allegiances...and was groomed by putin to be a plant / agent / spy for the sole purpose of pulling a fucking coup in the government of the usa...\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd yet people think this is an issue best handled by....voting????\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHope you'll remember that when you wake up on your knees in a camp somewhere."

'Well, Fox "News" is his biggest mainstream reporter, and they\'re not even legally a news broadcaster.\n\nThe media should most certainly not release any evidence at this time, this process and Mueller\'s investigation need to be untainted, now more than ever. Strict by-the-book lawmanship will win out, because if there is no mud to sling, the Trump supporter base slowly shrinks.'
"That's a fair way of looking at it.\n\nIf this were a set diagram, then 'conspiracy' and 'bribery' would be overlapping circles inside 'criminality' which is itself a circle inside  a larger circle of 'collusion'.  By denying 'collusion' Trump denies all illegality inside the biggest circle.\n\nThere remains another possibility outside the collusion circle, however, in that Russia supported Trump of its own free will, independent of Trump's actions, perhaps with knowledge of Trump's (blackmailable) corrupt finances with respect to Russia.  Just having a pee-pee tape is a good reason to support Trump.\n"

Trickle down economics, abolishing the minimum wage, all that garbage is just rich people using Libertarians for their own agenda. It's exactly why it won't work in real life, it only makes the system and the people more easily manipulable when you remove accountability and expect everyone to play nice.

Mueller just dropped THE HAMMER on Russia! Announced that top Russian officials hacked the DNC and boards of election across the United States. Enjoy your visit with Putin, Donald Trump.
President Putin admits supporting Donald Trump. Don't let this be scrubbed.
[Improved Audio] President Putin admits to supporting Trump during election. Don't let this be scrubbed.
White House says Trump will NOT be congratulating Putin on his election win, in part because of recent nerve agent attacks as well as serious irregularities in the Russian election. Trump, on his own, promptly calls Putin to congratulate him on his landslide ‚Äúvictory‚Äù.
Active US Diplomat: "The president [is] shitting on our NATO allies and kissing Putin's ass. He cares more about himself than the nation and any of us who serve it. Either he's compromised by Putin or he's a pussy, in which case he should grab himself." Thanks to the Republican party. Vote them out.
"WHOOO THIS COULD GET GOOD\n\nor mundane\n\nwhat if it's just asking for putin to mail over more sweet sweet blin"
'‚ÄúDo you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow ‚Äî if so, will he become my new best friend?‚Äù\n\nUghhh. "Do you think that the Prom King will come to my birthday party at the YMCA - if so, will we become besties? Lol, he\'s so awesome, OMG!"'
'"Putnam, I want to be Russian olagark, i like gold, you like gold, let have more gold. WINNING!" \n\nDonald Trump. '
'I think Putin is in love. Those eyes say it all! '
'So we have confirmation that Trump did not know Putin by the end of 2013.\n\nIf Trump was ‚Äúin collusion‚Äù with Putin he would at least have a way of contacting him other than posting general comments on Twitter.\n\nGreat job Mueller for disproving a connection between Trump and Putin. Mueller has exhaustively searched every possible link between Trump and Putin and we can definitively say there isn‚Äôt a link.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\nWe do know by the end of 2013 Hillary Clinton had accepted tens of millions of dollars from Russians and a Canadian linked directly to a state-owned Russian mining company.\n\nWe know for a fact that Hillary Clinton had deep ties to Russia well before Trump and that she received millions of dollars that could go towards the Presidential election. \n\nI think it is terrifying how closely the Clintons were to Russia and that the FBI should investigate the candidate who won the popular vote with extensive Russian support.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\nFortunately the candidate with no real ties to Russia won the election; and not the candidate with extensive ties to Russia.'
'Well, he was inviting him to his beauty pageant. Not an odd expectation in this particular scenario.'
'(Circle one)\n\nOption 1) Yes\n\nOption 2) Definitely yes'
'I read that and just said ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME.\n\nThe president owns beauty pageants to stare at 17-year old girls and has the thoughts 7-year old girl. '

'> I love how you still want to dig at a private citizen that holds no office.  Who cares about Clinton\n\n\nI love how the integrity of the US electoral process is ostensibly the cause for investigating Trump **but** the winner of the popular vote being connected to Russia has no bearing because that person ultimately lost.\n\nSo if Trump is connected to Putin it wouldn‚Äôt matter if he had lost the election?! That makes no sense. What idiocy.\n\n‚ÄúOooh. Sorry, Russia. You missed controlling the POTUS by *that much* but it‚Äôs OK we aren‚Äôt going to investigate or do anything to stop you from doing it again next time.

'Trump is authoritarian, and he wants to be a dictator. He said the North Korean state media is better than Fox New because it is "nicer" to their dear leader. He said the people of North Korea "love" their leader, and he wants the American people to feel the same way about him. He joked about being president forever, just like Xi in China. He says it\'s okay if Russia kills journalists, and he has joked about throwing reporters into prison.'
"I've been thinking since Trump meeting with Kim that this whole situation feels like the aligning of forces for ww3. The whole Trump verse Kim of the past few months was a show.... Trump is too stupid and is definitely Putin's pawn. Now Trump, Kim and Xi all meeting in Russia with Putin... The tariffs with China are a show too. Soon Trump will start pulling US trips out of the South China Sea, begin drawing down troops in South Korea and find away to back out of NATO. When the Muller investigation (s) begin showing their teeth at Trump, and it becomes clear Trump will be locked up, that's when sht will go down. Hopefully Trump doesn't have enough of the US armed forces on his side when that time comes. Hopefully he hasn't already compromised enough of US intelligence to completely weaken US Armed forces."
'Of fucking course it was! Were the concentration canps too or is that pure murican freedom ?'

"ok so? It's not a terrible idea. Show Kim that we are serious about peace. "
"Im glad that they're more informed people than 99.9 % of you on this subbreddit making decisions for our country. Enjoy your freedom. "
'Who cares a couple months ago Guam was being threatened with nuclear bombs now everybody is at peace thanks to Trump'
'Trump is a narcissist who defines his worth by "winning."  \n\nThat means Trump always requires an opponent.  He can\'t treat allies as friends because he has nothing to win against his friends.  He at least needs frenemies he can "stand up to" so he can win by being tough. Hence he\'s constantly sniping at our friends.   \n\nHe treats our enemies well because getting "deals" with them shows how he\'s winning again.  There\'s no strategy, no consideration of anything other than how it makes Trump look.  \n\nHe only does conflict where he wins.  Other than that, he doesn\'t know what to do.'
'Out of curiosity do you have sources on that? I‚Äôd love to read up on it from credible sources. '
'Sorry, but can you cite any of those claims about NK media being nicer? I really want to jam that in some people‚Äôs face'
'You are forgetting obama started the crack down on reporters. \n\nAnd yes trump does appear to be an aspiring dictator. I have no idea how he could do that. But it only takes 5% of the population to overgrown a government. \n\nAnd his 30% are ardent supporters. I dunno who would want to see dictator trump though. Its is insane.'

'So what? Our goal is greater good. What is your goal?'
"I would like some sort of deal to ease tension in NK. I would also like a president that doesn't act directly against the interest of the US 90% of the time. I would also enjoy if the president was competent. \n\nPulling out of war games in the Koreas isn't inherently a bad thing. Its not even inherently bad if Trump directly took Putins advice and decided to do so. That being said none of this happens in a vacuum. If this were isolated it would barely be a story. Since there is so much evidence of collusion or willingness to collude with foreign governments this is now a story. "
'I would really like a source for an updated/recent poll that specifically shows how many people support Trump and not just support the Republican party. I feel like the presidential approval ratings (lowest at 35% lol) is still intertwining the acts of Trump and the acts of Republicans. I am more interested in the number of people who actually support what his specific plans are (illegal immigration, trade wars, etc) as opposed to those who just like lower taxes'
'*where he can create the appearance of winning'

Thanks KC for showing us a good time.  '
'Russian-speaking American here. The english translation provided is a little bit misleading in Putin‚Äôs intent. The translator says, ‚ÄúYes I did, yes I did‚Äù, implying Putin is answering yes to both wanting Trump to win AND committing officials to help that cause. However, the actual correct translation should be, ‚ÄúYes, I did want Mr. Trump to win, because he promised to improve relations between the United States and Russia.‚Äù\n\nHe ignored the latter part of the question.'
'This is especially hilarious as rightwingers constantly say the left keeps pushing us toward censorship and government scrubbing of media but then their beloved representatives stand back and let Trump do all of it while they sit around with their thumbs up their own asses. '
"Wow this doesn't seem edited to fit a narrative at all"
'Wow it‚Äôs crazy that Putin wanted Trump this be president cause he wanted a healthy relationship with the president. That must mean he definitely tampered with the election which Obama literally said can‚Äôt happen. '
'American news reporters with sick mind twisting translation + circle jerkers 1.0.\n\n"putin did you want trump to win the election and did you direct bla bla"\n\n"yes i wanted him to win because relations blabla" (why the fuck did you translate "yes i did", he said yes i wanted him to win, well i know why but think for yourselves)\n\nle idiots: OMG PUTIN ELECTED TRUMP!! le keyboard riot!!!!\n\nthe fuck was he supposed to reply you clowns, no, actually i supported hillary which was actively calling for escalation between our countries?!'
'The interpretor made an poor translation.  I hear Putin saying " –î–∞, —è —Ö–æ—Ç–µ–ª, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –æ–Ω –≤—ã–∏–≥—Ä–∞–ª ( Da, ya khotel, chtoby on vyigral  )".  Word for word this translates as "Yes, I wanted that he won...".  It is clearly an indication of his support, but "Yes, Yes I did want him to win" as a confirmation of both questions is not the correct translation.  All the same, there is no denial on Putin\'s part.'
'At best? Neutral. Definitely not an ally'
"Antagonistic, but not hostile. Kind of like two people who don't like each other, but have to work together anyway. "
'I believe it may be a misuse or mistranslation of the concept of ‚Äúnormalizing relations.‚Äù\n\nThis is a quick google result that could show why Russia would want this:\n\nhttps://smallbusiness.chron.com/mean-normalize-business-relations-25701.html\n\nIt would also presumably include removing the magnitsky act sanctions, which would require more extensive googling but it‚Äôs out there if you‚Äôd like to read in to why that would be desired by Russia. '
'He misspoke and clearly meant to say "didn\'t", I think thats pretty obvious.'
'Exactly what I\'ve been trying to explain on another sub myself. The translation isn\'t accurate, he didn\'t say "Yes I did, Yes I did".\n\nEdit : learn some Russian before downvoting me into oblivion. '
'> ‚ÄúYes I did, yes I did‚Äù, implying Putin is answering yes to both\n\n Repeating the same thing twice doesn\'t really imply he\'s answering both questions one after another... \n\n The translator is clearly repeating the "Da" because he jumped the gun the 1st time, as Putin wasn\'t done with the sentence after "Da", and he was trying to make it clear Putin was saying that all as one sentence, to avoid making it seems that he just said "Yes!".\n\n > He ignored the latter part of the question.\n\n Somehow i doubt not denying it wasn\'t intentional... \n\n It\'s like when he always smirks when he says he\'s not poisoning/killing his opponents... \n\n '
'english english here and what i took from the translator was "yes I did" and "to improve relations".'
"This is about the transcript on whitehouse.gov omitting the question Putin did you want Trump to win?

"I love how you didn't finish the question asked because you know that was the more important part of the question.\n\nBut hey, you seem to like the fact that the US is weaker than ever and losing influence world wide.  An economy that was booming when he was handed the reigns but is starting to stall (guess you haven't noticed that no one is investing in the stock market, that it's being inflated by company buy backs)?  \n\nI mean, I understand you are a Troll from r/the_cuck but still.  What happened to having some pride in your country and caring about what happens to it?"
' Yeah, that translator must be in on it... \n\n Trump has been denying that Putin wanted him to win, and even after, he said the russians will help the Dems in autumn... you can check his twitter. \n\n '
'Well right now I am asking you a question, not the white house. But if I were to speculate, it would be because they knew people like you would reeeeeee. \n\nSo answer my question, would you think it was an issue if Merkel said she supported Clinton?'
"I'll say it clearly.\n\nIf you are a Trump supporter, you are NOT a patriot.  You are a disgrace to your country and everything it stands for.  \n\nThere is simply no valid reason for still supporting him, or the Republican party.\n\nThat American flag you probably have on the outside of your house?  Yeah, you can take it down because you dishonor it by supporting Trump.  \n\nI'm sure you could get yourself and nice hammer and sickle from Home Depot."
'The timing of the Friday indictments was a watershed moment.  I think we all knew how it was going to go, but for a moment, Trump was at a crossroads.  I hope his choice to side against the United States of America is what History will remember about Donald Trump.'

'Lol this sub is hilarious. You guys would impeach your own mother dare she say anything positive about Trump. Bunch of loonies on here. Welcome to Reddit I guess'
'Trump is taking the right approach. Unless you actually want to start arresting  Russian intelligence officers or overthrowing Putin, all one could do as a "normal" politician is huff and puff and stomp your feet. \n\nMeddling in elections is a time-honored tradition among superpowers (or former superpowers). The United States holds the record for most elections meddled in at 81. Russia (or the former Soviet Union) is second at 36. In 1964 both the Soviets and the United States meddled in the Chilean election. The CIA spent $2.4 million in secret to make sure the socialist did not win. With no surprise the Christian Democrat won. \n\nI felt that Facebook ads and hacked servers that should have been more secure would be a footnote in history. Instead, it\'s being used against a man who campaigned on and never made secret his desire to normalize relations with Russia to tackle bigger issues. He knows how other presidents have approached Russia and it has gotten us nowhere. He has seen how Europe is being slowly invaded and is buckling under its various welfare states and damn near Orwelian speech laws and won\'t be much stronger in the future. No loss there.\n\nIt really baffles me how anyone could be against Russia and America even just talking. Even if nothing happens, that\'s about as much as we could expect from any other administration when it comes to Russia and North Korea. \n\nI just have no strong feelings on it. I\'m cynical about all of it.  That\'s enough to get you exiled these days. \n\nI think a lot of it is jealousy from the establishment and their sympathisers. They should have been the ones dealing with the Russia problem, and all the other problems in the world, not the worse candidate in history who beat the best candidate in history. '

'**#TRE45ON**\n\nBelow I will summarize primary sources from the Justice Department, Senate Intelligence Committee, and the Department of Homeland Security. I will quote directly from primary sources. Today President Trump once again undermined American democracy and its institutions, instead he defended Putin\'s egregious attacks in front of the entire world.\n\n**July 3, 2018 the Senate Intelligence Committee, led by Republican Senator Richard Burr, concluded that Russia interfered with the American election and specifically helped Donald J. Trump.^[[1]](https://www.burr.senate.gov/download/final-ssci-ica-assessment)**\n\n*Pg. 4*\n\n>We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in  2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia\'s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\n\n**July 13, 2018 Special Counsel Mueller\'s indictment of 12 Russian Intelligence Officers.**\n\nLast week the Justice Department indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers linked to Guccifer 2.0 and their role in hacking Clinton and the DNC.^[[2]](https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download) The Russians had access to information on 500,000 voters, officially vote tallies were not changed however they targeted voter registration rolls.^[[3]](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/13/5-key-takeaways-from-mueller-indictment-of-russian-election-hackers.html)\n\n>The Russians allegedly hacked America\'s election infrastructure, including state election boards and secretaries of state. The allegations in Friday\'s indictment went well beyond merely hacking the Clinton campaign and Democratic campaign committees. From one state election board, the Russians managed to steal information on 500,000 voters, Rosenstein said, although he did not identify which state. Trump won the 2016 election by winning three key states by slim margins that added up to around 80,000 votes.\n\n>...An American congressional candidate allegedly asked for, and received, stolen documents about his or her opponent from the Russians. \n\n>...A journalist allegedly discussed with the Russian front account, Guccifer 2.0, about when to release stolen documents related to Black Lives Matter. \n\n>...Russian hackers targeted Clinton emails the same day Trump called for them to find "missing" emails.\n\n**July 27, 2016, remember the date. Candidate Trump publicly asked Russia for their help to hack Hillary Clinton, Russia obliged.**\n\nDuring a campaign rally in Florida on July 27, 2016, President Trump called on Russia to help him find Hillary Clinton\'s missing 30,000 emails.^[[4]](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html) Special Counsel Mueller\'s new indictment against 12 Russian Intelligence Officers found that on July 27, 2016 Russian hackers known as Guccifer 2.0 hacked Hillary Clinton\'s emails.\n\n*DoJ Indictment of 12 Russian Intelligence Officers Pg. 7 - 8*\n\n>The Conspirators spearphished individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign throughout the summer of 2016. For example, on or about July 27, 2016, the Conspirators attempted after hours to spearphish for the first time email accounts at a domain hosted by a thirdparty provider and used by Clinton‚Äôs personal office. At or around the same time, they also targeted seventy-six email addresses at the domain for the Clinton Campaign. \n\n**June 9, 2016 - A month before candidate Trump publicly asked for help from a foreign adversary, his surrogates met with Russian operatives at the now infamous Trump Tower meeting.**\n\nOne of the Russian operatives present at the infamous Trump Tower meeting, Rinat Akhmetshin, has ties to Russian intelligence and has a history of being embroiled in  court cases related to hacking campaigns. He also has ties to Paul Manafort.^[[5]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/21/us/rinat-akhmetshin-russia-trump-meeting.html?referer=)\n\n>He has an association with a former deputy head of a Russian spy service, the F.S.B., and a history of working for close allies of President Vladimir V. Putin. Twice, he has worked on legal battles for Russian tycoons whose opponents suffered sophisticated hacking attacks, arousing allegations of computer espionage.\n\n>Few episodes from Mr. Akhmetshin‚Äôs past seem more relevant to Mr. Mueller‚Äôs investigation than his work for two Russian billionaires accused of infiltrating their adversaries‚Äô computers during nasty legal battles.\n\n>The Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 took place less than a week before revelations that hackers had penetrated the Democratic National Committee‚Äôs computers and obtained a trove of emails. Investigators have traced digital espionage to Russian spy agencies. \n\n>During the same period that Mr. Akhmetshin was accused of being involved in various hacking schemes, he appears to have been nurturing a relationship with Viktor Ivanov, once the deputy head of Russia‚Äôs intelligence service, the F.S.B., and until last year a top aide to Mr. Putin.\n\n\n>Mr. Akhmetshin told journalists that he was a longtime acquaintance of Paul J. Manafort, who served as a high-paid consultant to Mr. Yanukovych for years before becoming chairman of the Trump campaign.\n\n**August 22, 2017 Senate Intelligence Committee Testimony that the Trump campaign accepted regular intelligence from the Kremlin**\n\nThe Senate Judiciary committee testimony of Fusion GPS CEO Glenn Simpson was released unilaterally by Senator Feinstein because Republicans refused. Simpson confirms that the Trump campaign likely received foreign intelligence aid during the 2016 campaign as Manafort had close ties to Russian Intelligence.^[[6]](https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/3/9/3974a291-ddbe-4525-9ed1-22bab43c05ae/934A3562824CACA7BB4D915E97709D2F.simpson-transcript-redacted.pdf)\n\n*Pg. 154 - 155 Senate Judiciary Committee Testimony*\n\n>A. I mean, one of the key lines here in the second paragraph says "However, he and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his democratic and other political rivals." So the issue with the Trump Tower meeting, as 1 I understand it, is that the Trump people were eager to accept intelligence from a foreign government about their political rivals and that is, you know, I would say, a form of interference. If you\'re getting help from a foreign government and your help is intelligence, then the foreign government\'s interfering. I mean, you know, I think that also -- of course, in retrospect we now know this was pretty right on target in terms on what it says. So anyway --\n\n>Q. In reference to you think that particular sentence?\n\n>A. I mean, it clearly refers to, you know, them being interested in and willing to -- it depicts them as accepting information. What we have seen to date with the disclosures this year is they were at a minimum super interested in getting information.\n\n>Q. And when you\'re referencing the "disclosures this year," could you just be specific about that.\n\n>A. The Trump Tower meeting.\n\n>Q. So with reference to the June 9th Trump Tower meeting?\n\n>A. Yes.

"Look at our new friends now, it turns out they *did* save you from crooked Hillary!

I told you he would respect me! "
'Trump is openly siding with Putin regarding his interference in our free and fair elections and disregarding the warnings our entire intelligence community have given. The only thing ‚Äúloony‚Äù is Trump‚Äôs continued support of Putin and his government. '
'I love the "patriots" who are more inclined to believe foreign intelligence than our own domestic intelligence agencies.'
'Sure, and we should absolutely take his word at face value with zero evidence.  Throughout the campaign Trump stuttered "No collusion" and the eloquent gem "no puppet, no puppet.  You\'re the puppet." So clearly they\'re both innocent, being the upstanding and totally truthful people they\'ve shown themselves to be time and time again.\n\nSeriously, Putin basically says "no u" and people like you cheer like braying donkeys about how the cuck libs are BTFO.  In the words of Dear Leader, "SAD!"'

This operation was funded through Russian fronts, including a catering company run by a close friend of Putin, Yevgeny Prigozhin. They used stolen American identities. Operatives bought political ads on social media sites. Operatives visited the United States, traveled across 9 states and discussed escape routes if they were caught inside the country. Operatives bought equipment including burner phones and SIM cards. The operation included hundreds of employees and millions of dollars, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein put it best  - the Russians conducted information warfare during the election.^[[2]](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-43092569/russians-conducted-information-warfare-on-us-election) According to the indictment Prigozhin met Mikhail Bystrov, a leader of the Internet Research Agency (IRA), regularly in 2015 and 2016. Prigozhin funded the Internet Research Agency and their meddling of the American election. This was a sophisticated operation that spanned over several years.

The conspiracy had as its object impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful government functions of the United States by dishonest means in order to enable the Defendants to interfere with US political and electoral processes, including the 2016 US presidential election.  \n\n>**Manner and Means of the Conspiracy:**\n\n> 29.. Starting at least in or around 2014, Defendants and their co-conspirators began to track and study groups on US social media sites dedicated to US politics and social issues. In order to gauge the performance of various groups on social media sites, the ORGANIZATION tracked certain metrics like the group\'s size, the frequency of content places by the group, and the level of audience engagement with that content, such as the average number of comments or responses to  a post. \n\n\n\n>a. KRYLOVA and BOGACHEVA, together with other defendants and co-conspirators, planned travel itineraries, purchases equipment (such as cameras, SIM cards, and drop phones), and discussed security measures (including "evacuation scenarios") for Defendants who traveled to the United States. \n\n\n>**Use of US Social Media Platforms**\n\n>32.. Defendants and their co-conspirators, through fraud and deceit, created hundres of social media accounts and used them to develop certain fictitious US personas into "leader[s] of public opinion" in the United States. \n\n>**Use of US Computer Infrastructure**\n\n>39.. To hide their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation, Defendants and their co-conspirators - particularly POLOZOV and the ORGANIZATION\'s IT department - purchases space on computer servers located inside the United States in order to set up virtual private networks ("VPNs"). Defendants and their co-conspirators connected from Russia to the US based infrastructure by way of these VPNs and conducted activity inside the United Sates - including accessing online social media accounts, opening new accounts, and communicated with real US persons - while masking the Russian origin and control of the activity. \n\n>40.. Defendants and their co-conspirators also registered and controlled hundreds of web-based email accounts hosted by US email providers under false names so as to appear to be US persons and groups. From these accounts, Defendants and their co-conspirators registered or linked to online social media accounts in order to monitor them; posed as US persons when requesting assistance from real US persons; contacted media outlets in order to promote activities inside the United States; and conducted other operations, such as those set forth below. \n\n>**Use of Stolen US Identities**\n\n>41.. In or around 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators also uses, possessed, and transferred, without lawful authority, the social security numbers and dates of birth of real US persons without those persons\' knowledge or consent. Using these means of identification, Defendants and their co-conspirators opened accounts at PayPal, a digital payment service provider; created false means of identification, including fake driver\'s licenses; and posted on ORGANIZATION - controlled social media accounts using the identities of these US victims. \n\n>**Actions Targeting the 2016 US Presidential Election**\n\n>42.. By approximately May 2014, Defendants and their co-conspirators discussed efforts to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election. Defendants and their co-conspirators began to monitor US social media accounts and other sources of information about the 2016 US presidential election. \n\n>43.. By 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used their fictitious online personas to interfere with the 2016 US presidential election. They engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump. \n\n>45.. Defendants and their co-conspirators also used false US personas to communicate with unwitting members, volunteers, and supporters of the Trump Campaign involved in local community outreach, as well as grassroots groups that supported then-candidate Trump. These individuals and entities at times distributed the ORGANIZATION\'s materials through their own accounts via retweets, reposts, and similar means. Defendants and their co-conspirators then monitored the propagation of content through such participants. \n\n>46.. In or around the latter half of 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, through their ORGANIZATION-controlled personas, began to encourage US minority groups not to vote in the 2016 US presidential election or to vote for a third-party US presidential candidate. \n\n>47.. Starting in or around the summer of 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators also began to promote allegations of voter fraud by the Democratic Party through their fictitious US personas and groups on social media. Defendants and their co-conspirators purchased advertisements on Facebook to further promote the allegations. \n\n>**Political Advertisements**\n\n>48.. From at least April 2016 through November 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, while concealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation through false personas, began to produce, purchase, and post advertisements on US social media and other online sites expressly advocating for the election of then-candidate Trump or expressly opposing Clinton. Defendants and their co-conspirators did not report their expenditures to the Federal Election Commission, or register as foreign agents with the US Department of Justice. \n\n**March 15, 2018 U.S. Department of Homeland Security Computer Emergency Readiness Team - Russian Government Cyber Activity Targeting Energy and Other Critical Infrastructure Sectors^[[3]](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A)**\n\n>This joint Technical Alert (TA) is the result of analytic efforts between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

'**Hillary Clinton email controversy**\n\nThe Hillary Clinton email controversy was a major public controversy arising from the use by  Hillary Clinton of her family\'s private email server for official communications during her tenure as United States Secretary of State rather than official State Department email accounts maintained on secure federal servers. Those official communications included over 100 emails which contained classified information (but did not have classification markings) at the time they were sent, as well as 2,093 emails which were not marked classified but would retroactively be ranked as "confidential" by the State Department. Post-election analyses of media coverage during the 2016 presidential campaign show that the Clinton email controversy received the most extensive coverage of any topic.The controversy unfolded against the backdrop of Clinton\'s 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the United States House Select Committee on Benghazi. Some experts, officials, and members of Congress contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures, as well as federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

"Fortunately my brown GF will be reacclumating me tonight If you catch my drift. Bonning. I'm talking about bonning my POC GF. I support POCGF. \n\nJust figured out what my first foundation will be when I get rich because of the Trump tax cut. \n\nDamn it. Fox still has me. I was only on their site for 8 minutes!!! "
'Pretty Ironic, it says America first, but based on the comments it seems very much like Russia first. Trump second.'
'Even Fox News admits Russia attacked our elections. To believe otherwise would be to trust Putin and Trump unquestioningly. Why would you trust proven liars?'
'I love how they always default to Soros the Supervillain.\n\nLike the Russian oligarchs are fewer and less manipulative'
"Is this the best their AI can come up with? Better to just throw darts at Aesop's Fables. Pathetic."
'"Libcuck prof" sounds like a pre-teen in a video game chat - why are we talking about politics like this now? '
'It gets really hilarious when they mock others for "safe spaces." Then what\'s T_D if not a safe space for those idiots?'
'Lol I thought this comment was funny and then I realized you are a Trump supporter and are completely serious.  Yikes'
"Give me one policy of trumps that you don't agree with and why ? Yikes getting judge for wanting America to be succeed  And yah I do support trump but if there's collusion with proof then get him out of there, there's a reason I come to this sub. Lmao ur mad because there isn't collusion, it's pathetic that u hope he's a Putin puppet."
'Haha no I just have better things to do than check replies on reddit from triggered trumptards. Like a job...'
"Hey, I've seen you post this a bunch today in different subs and I appreciate the effort and intent, but given google's rep for data gathering, I'm a bit skeptical of sharing this link with others. Because I would love to help in the effort to motivate others. Someone set me straight on this."
"It's pretty mixed but in fairness I post a lot, in the middle ground between the hystericals and god-worshippers just trying to get the sober view. I might steer a little one way, play provocateur at times but I'm not clinging to anything. Defending the contrary  view is  an established way to get the best alignment on any issue."
'True market forces at work. If all the Nato allies increase spending (which they should and have already agreed to as Obama was demanding this bluntly too) they should aim all the spending to EU and Canadian firms.\n\nSe how Trumputin likes that. '
"Hasn't this theme, of America carrying an unfair military burden/services for free,  been one of the few areas where Trump has actually been consistent?  Pretty sure he's said it about  America's protection of Japan, Korea. IIRC commenting on the arrangement with Japan was one of his first things he did that was notably political, like 30 years ago. "
'Clean clean money trail ;  \n& / or  \nPorn Snuff film  '
"Trump thinks he's so invincible, surely he thinks blackmail will roll off him, too. Trump simply likes authoritarianism and corruption, just like Putin. BFF's."

"I've done a lot of reading about what it could possibly be, though I don't know anything anyone else may know, but I am fairly certain its 2 things. One, money laundering on a large scale. I'm talking millions to hundreds-of-millions of dollars of money laundering for Russians/Ukrainians through real estate and other means.\n\nTwo, as you and many others have stated, there must be tapes of prostitutes, possibly underage, involving some gnarly stuff that would certainly be embarrassing to anyone. I'd be willing to bet a lot on it being at the very least, one of the two mentioned above.\n\nOf course, this would all be very clear, at least for the first instance I stated, if Trump released his tax returns. I'll bet everything I own that Trump has massive financial ties to Putin-linked entities."
'A large portion of his supporters come from areas where not only incest, but underage incest and child brides are surprisingly common. The thought of an adult male with an underage girl is repulsive to most Americans, but his supporters would definitely defend it.'

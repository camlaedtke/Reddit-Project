'Woah there, you left something crucially important out of your list of relevant facts and your assessment of the situation: Historical Context, and Modern U.S. history...\n\nSpecifically, COINTELPRO and the FBI’s long and *VERIFIABLE* history of using illegal tactics to sabotage *liberal* dissident movements and to undermine public support for such movements with lies, omission, disinformation, and deceitful media narratives.\n\nOops, looks like you accidentally ignored a crucially relevant fact because you were too busy pretending that the exclusively for-profit MSM can be relied on to give you all the facts, without reservation. Classic “Good American” ignorance. \n\nTo be clear, I’m *not* arguing that the people listed in this post’s title aren’t guilty. In fact, I suspect most/all of them they are—to some extent—guilty as sin. That being said....\n\n*All* facts considered, trusting the FBI to investigate Trump—or corruption in general—makes about as much sense as trusting *Trump* to investigate Trump. You’d have to be a naïve fool who’s oblivious to modern world history to support such a shortsighted and self-defeating course of action.\n\nIf America’s Democrats (faux-liberals) were as intellectually-independent, informed, and noble as they present themselves to be, and if America’s Republicans (faux-conservatives) were as intellectual, informed, and noble as they present themselves to be, they wouldn’t constantly be playing into this divisive, billionaire-sponsored game of cutthroat pseudo-politics. Rather, they would be communicating, uniting, and organizing to investigate *both* Trump and the FBI, not to mention the Federal Government and the Corporate MSM at large, and to hold all relevant parties accountable for their misdeeds.\n\nAlas, American democrats and conservatives will only support a cause if it’s petty, cheap, and convenient, and only if it doesn’t require them to admit that they’ve been completely wrong about something important. All of you act surprised when the state of the nation—and the world we’ve actively been bullying into submission for decades—keeps getting worse, and worse, and worse. Meanwhile, virtually *none* of you are making an honest effort to *actually* do the right thing, because you’re selfishly afraid of what it might cost you.\n\nY’all are every bit as ignorant, narrow-minded, cowardly, and baselessly self-righteous as the poor chumps who thought Trump would actually “drain the swamp”. \n\nGet real, guys. Truth hurts, and it’s humbling, *especially* for modern Americans. Grow the heck up, and face the ugly reality that our willful ignorance has fostered so we can stand a fighting chance at repairing our fucked up world before we drive humanity to self-destruct beyond repair. Or, you can write me off as some deluded, uninformed, socially-deviant “extremist” (lolol) and write me off altogether without actually pausing to *reflect* on what I’m trying to tell you, just because I refuse to reaffirm your disastrously misinformed, pre-packaged pseudo-worldview.

'Thanks for actually engaging me in conversation! Most people just insult me, and make no effort to actually converse.\n\nTo be honest, I think you’ve lost sight of the fine line that separates pessimism from realism in the world of politics. The problem isn’t that “politicians on both sides can lack testicles”. That’s a severely naïve assessment if you ask me. \n\nThe problem—in a nutshell—is that our entire political system has been entirely corrupted by the wealthy and well-connected—people who either rose to power by selling their souls in order to excel at cutthroat capitalism, or who inherited their power and feel like dominion over commoners is their birthright. \n\nOn top of that, the problem is that popular opinion is now *literally* dictated by those same people via mainstream media, which has come to be controlled *exclusively* by that particular class of person via finance. Both the mainstream liberal media and the mainstream conservative media (the only news media Americans take seriously) are entirely subservient to the people who can afford to finance them. Because of this, investigative journalism has effectively gone extinct, only to be replaced by brainwashy, subversive, and intellectually dishonest sensationalism. After all, investigative journalists live to expose corruption and abuses of power, which is extremely bad for business if you’re one of the corrupt, power-hungry financiers behind every for-profit news conglomerate from FOX to CNN. The free press is supposed to be a weapon the people can wield against would-be tyrants. Now, thanks to the corrupting power of money, it’s a weapon that the wealthy and well-connected wield against the people with devastating efficiency and cunning. These days, virtually every incriminating truth and innovative idea that could stand to shift the balance of power towards the people and away from the wealthy is drowned out by an endless stream of sensationalist propaganda. Rogue dissidents who somehow manage to make themselves heard invariably have their credibility baselessly eviscerated by a legion of corporate reporters. News flash: if dozens of corporate reporters publicly denounce an individual as a liar, even if that individual is the only person who’s actually standing by the truth, people will believe it, no matter what. Obviously, such cases are the exception, not the rule, but the fact that people can— and *do*—get away with this sort of scheme is a *huge* red flag. The way our government and media treat whistleblowers is proof enough of this concept. Gary Webb is a shining example of how this happens. If you don’t know about him, the movie Kill The Messenger does an excellent job of telling his story. Really, you can read up on *any* modern American whistleblower to verify the validity of this claim.\n\nI’m not going to bother touching on how mass media can easily be used to manipulate public elections. After all, every American liberal is up in arms over Trump/Russia because of this, although I can’t even begin to fathom why liberals can’t bring themselves to recognize that *American* propaganda has the exact same effect on our political process as Russian propaganda, albeit to a much, *much* greater magnitude. \n\nOn top of all *that*, the problem is that the American people at large have no interest whatsoever in suspending their blissfully naïve, narrow-scoped, mass-media-driven “worldviews” long enough to let reality set in, because they’re too stubborn, too afraid, and too arrogant to admit that they’ve let themselves be manipulated by homegrown corporate propagandists. Liberals overwhelmingly do this. Conservatives overwhelmingly do this. Both sides *regularly* call one another out for doing this. Yet, evidently, both sides would sooner let the world descend into chaos and violence than they would admit that they’ve been acting like moronic hypocrites this whole time. \n\nBy the way, the way Democrats have reacted to this Russian propaganda pseudo-scandal has effectively sent this message to the world: “It’s okay if *we* meddle in other nation’s governments, and bully them into submission with our military and economic might, but if any of you try doing it to us, we’ll come unhinged.” Not a great message for American liberals to send to the world when we’re trying to earn their respect, support, and cooperation. I’d encourage you to revisit the claims I made about the FBI in my original comment while keeping that thought in mind. The FBI—not to mention American law enforcement in general—has always been an anti-liberal organization, and this is *exactly* the kind of deceitful, manipulative tactic that people in power use to undermine public support for liberal causes. Seriously, read up on COINTELPRO and modern counterintelligence tactics, and prepare to have your mind blown.\n\nAll in all, American politics has gone from being a respectable profession of public service to being a cutthroat game played by aloof upper-echelon narcissists, and oblivious idiots who are too naïve to threaten the status quo. Similarly, American news media have gone from being principled bastions of truth to being omnipresent propaganda machines that work exclusively for the radically wealthy. Until Americans can come to terms with the fact the free press died on our watch, and that we let our government become corrupt while we were busy getting drunk, watching sports, and hanging out at the mall, the free press will stay dead, and nothing will ever change. \n\nNow, for the love of humanity, you folks *have* to stop blaming conservatives for running our nation—and the world—into the ground, because you’re just as guilty as they are. Just because you were smart enough to recognize that Donald Trump—the most obviously corrupt presidential candidate in American history—is a crook, and just because you’re not brainwashed enough to fear immigrants doesn’t mean you haven’t been blindly aligning yourselves with crooks each and every time you vote, and it doesn’t mean you haven’t been brainwashed too.\n\nThe sad irony here is that you believe *I’m* the pessimist, when you’re the one who’s clearly resigned himself to this insane game of divisive, anti-productive, cutthroat politics, and I’m the one who wholeheartedly believes that we can *definitely* fix all this shit if we just stop playing into this game by ruthlessly and hypocritically shaming each other for making mistakes that we’ve *all* been making, and start working together instead. \n\nAt any rate, after seeing all the arrogant, self-righteous, and hypocritical bullshit that Democrats have been spewing since the 2016 election, I can say for certain that I’m never voting democrat again. Obviously I won’t be voting republican either., but y’all lost my loyalty when you became completely unhinged after losing to Trump—*the most blatantly corrupt presidential candidate of all time*. The fact that we lost to him should have been a huge wake up call for Democrats. Instead, dems are using it as an excuse to ridicule and alienate people who are marginally less worldly-wise than they are—the people we need to team up with if we want to un-corrupt our government and media so they start working *for* the people, not against them.\n\nAnyways, thanks again for engaging me in conversation! I hope I was able to get you thinking!\n\nAll the best, cool guy!'

"With Watergate the first arrests were made in June '72 and a smoking gun linking the president to a specific crime was published in August the same year.\n\nIn the Trump/Russia collusion case there was an FBI investigation started in mid-2016, the HIC investigation started in early 2017, and Mueller's special council which started in mid-2017.\n\nTwo of them found nothing, and as of right now there's nothing indicating that the third has found anything.\n\nI don't see this as a conservative position, it just... is what it is."
"I think it's that Russia isn't a hive mind. It's perfectly reasonable for a representative to tell the truth when asked a question. That's all that this is. It doesn't necessarily mean it's a tactic.\n\n\nAnd I also think Russia has already got what it wanted. It doesn't want the US to destabilize. The world's most powerful military being led by a destabilized government is likely no major nation state's desire. That just makes Russia a target even more.\n\n\nI think Putin just wanted to be taken seriously. I think the Russian people, after a humiliating collapse and then economic depression and embarrassing alcoholic leadership, and *then* geopolitical embarrassments like Iraq, Kosovo, color revolutions... Russia and the Russian people just wanted to be taken seriously so that their threats (like during Iraq and Kosovo) will be taken seriously.\n\n\nI also think the US and the West in general is ludicrously naive sometimes. First of all, the US 100% has more efforts to sway Russian public opinion than *anything* Russia did. Simply, Russia isn't a true democracy so the results aren't as dramatic. And second of all, we all do our best to blame Russia or whoever for the fact that, undeniably, tens of millions of our neighbors and family members intentionally voted for a complete idiot that was caught bragging about sexual harassment on tape. Like anywhere else in the developed world our situation would even be *possible*."
"No your right. And both sides are playing right into they're hands. We need to arrest the corrupt, and prosecute them. But sadly I don't think any politicians will be jailed, besides a handful of trump admins. We need to also Start an actual dialogue with the other side, but its hard when both sides are in hysterics. "
'I think that thinking Putin "just wanted to be taken seriously" is ridiculously naive. Russia has goals. Putin has plans.'
'The Russian people didn’t work to undermine our election. Their government did. That sort of rhetoric is a barrier to the fact that people in general don’t hate each other. Governments get belligerent towards each other, politicians amplify the emotions, and people pay the price. It’s just a big geopolitical and financial game to these people. It’s corrupt and negligent.'
'The Russian people are, by all accounts, very supportive of the current regime in Russia. Russia is a sprawling diverse federation of many different communities. Sure, any semblance of dissent is crushed instantly. But if there was widespread dissatisfaction, that system would collapse. Easily.'

'\n\nIm not sure... In addition the the examples below I will add that CNN, after the election, was caught interviewing a random voter who later was revealed to be their camera man and cutting to a blank screen whenever a guest opposes their narrative.  "Oh no, that sucks".  Below is why they are known as "Clinton News Network" and "Chicken Noodle News". \n\n\n\nCoverage of the 2016 U.S. presidential election\n\nOn April 3, 2016, hundreds of supporters of\xa0Bernie Sanders\xa0protested outside of CNN\xa0Los Angeles. Sanders supporters were protesting\xa0CNN\'s coverage of the\xa02016 United States presidential elections, specifically in regards to the lack of airtime Sanders has received. Known as Occupy CNN, protesters claimed that\xa0major media networks\xa0have intentionally blacked out Sanders\'\xa0presidential campaign\xa0in favor of giving much more airtime to candidates such as\xa0Hillary Clinton.\n\nDonna Brazile and Roland MartinEdit\n\nIn October 2016,\xa0WikiLeaks\xa0published\xa0emailsfrom\xa0John Podesta\xa0which showed CNN contributor\xa0Donna Brazile\xa0passing the questions for a CNN-sponsored debate to the Clinton campaign. In the email, Brazile discussed her concern of Clinton\'s ability to field a question regarding the death penalty. The following day Clinton would receive the question about the death penalty, verbatim from an audience member at the CNN-hosted Town Hall event.[14]\xa0According to a\xa0CNNMoney\xa0investigation, the debate moderator\xa0Roland Martin\xa0of\xa0TV One\xa0"did not deny sharing information with Brazile."CNN severed ties with Brazile on October 14, 2016.\n\nWikileaks emailsEdit\n\nCNN anchor\xa0Chris Cuomo\xa0said on a live coverage of the 2016 elections that downloading the\xa0Podesta emails\xa0from the\xa0Wikileaks\xa0website was illegal, and that only the media could legally do so. The statement drew criticism to the network for being false.\n\nTrump administration coverage\n\nOn January 10, 2017, CNN reported on the existence of classified documents that said Russia had compromising personal and financial information about then President-elect\xa0Donald Trump. CNN did not publish\xa0the dossier, or any specific details of the dossier. Later that day,\xa0BuzzFeed\xa0published the entire 35-page dossier with a disclaimer that it was unverified and "includes some clear errors".\xa0The dossier had been read widely by political and media figures in Washington, and had been sent to multiple other journalists who had declined to publish it as it was unsubstantiated.At a press conference the following day, Trump referred to CNN as\xa0fake news\xa0and refused to take a question from CNN reporter\xa0Jim Acosta.\n\n\n\nOn June 26, 2017, three network investigative journalists; Thomas Frank,\xa0Eric Lichtblau, and Lex Haris, resigned from CNN over a false story, later retracted, that connected\xa0Anthony Scaramucci\xa0to a $10 billion Russian investment fund. The network apologized to Scaramucci and stated that the online story did not meet their\xa0editorial standards.\n\nOn November 6, 2017, CNN ran a story entitled "Trump asks Japan to build cars in the U.S. It already does."\xa0The story included only a partial quote from President Trump stating that he would like Japan (more) to make cars in America. However, CNN originally omitted the remainder of his statement congratulating two Japanese automakers for investing more money in the US to build another factory. The Washington Post took notice and criticized the report.The Post called the headline "snarky," and told the network, and others, to stop "cherry-picking the quote." CNN later changed the quote and the headline, issuing the following correction: "The original version of this article and its headline did not make clear that President Trump had praised Japanese automakers for expanding existing U.S. facilities and for making new investments in the U.S. The article and headline have been updated."\xa0\n\nThe Washington Post again fact-checked a CNN report regarding Trump on December 8, 2017: CNN ran a story that claimed two sources told the network that the Trump campaign received an email that gave Trump and his son Don Jr early access to Wikileaks documents on September 4, 2016. CNN had not obtained the supposed September 4th email. The sender was "Michael J. Erickson", who CNN was not able to contact.\xa0The Washington Post, however, did obtain the email, which showed that the email was actually sent on the day after the hacked documents were released by WikiLeaks--September 14, 2016.\xa0CNN issued a correction their story.\n\nThe network also imposed new rules on Russia related stories being published to social, video, editorial, or MoneyStream without going through the chain of command within CNN.\n\n\nPersian Gulf War\n\nDuring the\xa0Persian Gulf War, CNN was criticized for excessively pushing\xa0human interest stories\xa0and avoiding depictions of violent images; the result of all this being an alleged "propagandistic" presentation of news.\xa0A report by\xa0Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting\xa0(FAIR) quotes an unnamed CNN reporter as describing "the \'sweet beautiful sight\' of bombers taking off from\xa0Saudi Arabia".\n\nCoverage of Iranian protests\n\nIn 2014, the network was criticized for an unusual absence of live coverage of a large set of protests that followed the\xa02014 elections in Iran.\n\nOperation TailwindEdit\n\nIn 1998, CNN, in partnership with sister\xa0Timemagazine, ran a report that\xa0Operation Tailwindin 1970 in Vietnam involved the use of\xa0Saringas to kill a group of\xa0defectors\xa0from the\xa0United States military.\xa0The Pentagon\xa0denied the story. Skeptics deemed it improbable that such an extraordinary and risky\xa0atrocity\xa0could have gone unnoticed at the height of the\xa0Vietnam War\'s unpopularity. CNN, after a two-week inquiry, issued a retraction. The story\'s producers were summarily fired, and one of them has been highly critical of CNN\'s handling of the story, saying that the network bowed to pressure from high-ranking officials to kill the story.\n\n\nJeff Zucker\n\nCNN was criticized for its coverage of the\xa0Boston Marathon bombings, after erroneously reporting that a "dark-skinned male" had been arrested in connection with the attack. In the aftermath of the broadcast,\xa0Jeff Zucker\xa0– who became president of CNN in 2013 – lauded the coverage, claiming that "CNN shined this week",\xa0and boasted ratings success that CNN achieved during the coverage, adding that "viewers respected the network\'s accountability when it admitted its mistakes". Jon Stewart criticized Zucker\'s comments after calling CNN\'s coverage of the\xa0Washington Navy Yard shooting\xa0"breathless wrongness", claiming that "The lesson they take from this is – it doesn\'t matter how much they betray our trust."\n\nFredricka Whitfield\n\nOn June 13, 2015, while discussing the\xa02015 attack on the Dallas police headquarters, host\xa0Fredricka Whitfield\xa0referred to the gunman, James Boulware, as "courageous and brave, if not crazy". The comment received immediate backlash and calls for her to apologize. The next day, Whitfield stated on air that she misspoke and in no way believed the gunman was courageous or brave. After the backlash continued, she issued another on-air apology on June 15, saying she terribly misused those words, now understood how offensive it was and was sincerely sorry.\n\nM.I.A. Interview\n\nIn June 2009, musician\xa0M.I.A.\xa0stated she did an hour-long interview with CNN condemning the mass bombing and\xa0Tamil\xa0civilian fatalities at the hands of Government forces in\xa0Sri Lanka\xa0in 16 weeks the same year, "and they cut it down to one minute and made it about my single\xa0Paper Planes. When I went to the\xa0Grammys, I saw the same reporter from CNN, and I was like, \'Why did you do that?\' And she said, \'Because you used the G-word.\'" "Genocide. I guess you\'re not allowed to say that on CNN"\n\nSteubenville High School rape case coverage\n\nCNN revealed the name of the 16-year-old victim on March 17 by broadcasting unedited footage of one of the convicted rapists\' post-conviction statements. This practice is against the\xa0Associated Pressguidelines for coverage.\n\nMilwaukee riots coverageEdit\n\nDuring the\xa02016 Milwaukee riots, CNN showed a clip of Sylville Smith\'s sister, Sherelle Smith, urging rioters: "Don\'t bring that violence here," and referred to her as calling for peace. The rest of her speech, which was not included in the broadcast, included the following: "Burning down shit ain\'t going to help nobody! Y\'all burning down shit we need in our community. Take that shit to the suburbs! Burn that shit down! We need our weave. I don\'t wear it, but we need it." After being called out for selective editing, a CNN reporter involved in the story tweeted that they had "shorthanded" the quote and posted a link to a corrected video on CNN\'s website, which began with the screen shot that read: "An earlier version of this story mischaracterized what the victim\'s sister was trying to convey. She was calling for peace in her community, urging the protesters to go elsewhere."\n\n\nSome controversy was created by the use of CNN on-air staff for fictionalized reports and broadcasts in the science-fiction movie\xa0Contact.\n\n\n\nIsrael–Gaza conflictEdit\n\nDuring the\xa02014 Gaza conflict, hundreds of protesters came to the\xa0Time Warner Center, where CNN\'s\xa0New York City\xa0production facilities and bureau are housed. Various people accused CNN of biased coverage during live interviews on the network.\n\nSemi-automatic weapons\n\nCNN apologized for a May 15, 2003, story in which CNN\'s\xa0John Zarella\xa0and\xa0Broward County, Florida\xa0Sheriff\xa0Ken Jennedemonstrated the rapid firing of\xa0fully automatic\xa0firearms while covering the federal\xa0Assault Weapons Ban, due to expire the following year. The Assault Weapons Ban was concerned solely with\xa0semi-automatic firearms, not fully automatic ones, which had already been restricted by the\xa0National Firearms Act\xa0of 1934, and the subsequent 1986\xa0Firearm Owners Protection Act.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'

'[Trump is the ultimate classification authority.  If he leaks information to anyone he\'s largely only responsible to himself.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/16/james-risch/does-president-have-ability-declassify-anything-an/)   The leak of information to the Russians could be considered treason and therefore "high crimes and misdemeanors" and grounds for impeachment -- but without connecting all those dots up, he doesn\'t violate any laws by leaking classified information.  Leaking information to Kushner alone is unlikely to be grounds for impeachment unless Kushner actively uses that to commit treason, etc.'

'I edited my comment from before.  Please let the new information sink in.  Russia hacked emails in violation of the law and if you actually read them without a Facebook/RT slant, you\'d see that they were a whole bunch of nothingburgers.  They also hacked the RNC (bet you didn\'t know that) and didn\'t use the material.     \nRussia is not our friend.  Not mine.  Not yours.  Not anyone\'s, including Donald Trump, though he seems to fail to realize it at this moment.  You can\'t deny that closed door meeting with the Russian Foreign Ambassador was fishy.  You can\'t deny that Donald Jr. basically said he intended to collude with Russia for "dirt" on Hillary Clinton.  You can\'t call it oppo research when there is quid pro quo from a foreign power involved AKA the repeal of the Magnitsky act in exchange for "adopting Russian babies" which we both know wasn\'t the point.     \nHere is some reading on the subject: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Act'

'Don’t be dumb, respond dude. What are your thoughts on Junior’s emails, Trump requesting the Russians to hack Hillary, and Kushner and Sessions visits with Kremlin officials? This is why I said you’re in a cult dude. You’re not engaging any of these questions, merely dismissing them as “lol, silly Facebook.” '
'[this](http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2017/12/01/us/flynn-sanctions-russia/s/02dc-flynn-newdocs-slide-HJHZ.html)\n\nSpecifically lays out the evidence of trump committing treason and Flynn signed it. Flynn has flipped and will be testifying against trump and his family. Trump ordered him to meet with Russians to discuss eliminating sanctions in exchange for election assistance. As is laid out clearly in the charges Flynn plead guilty to. \n\nEdit: in case you need reminding, thensanctions we’re in place due to Russians assassinating a lawyer whose exposed corruption. Obama was still president and this meeting undermined his authority with an enemy nation who we were currently adding more sanctions on for invading Ukraine. This isn’t a friendly state, it’s our enemies he conspired with to undermine democracy and America. \n\nI would implore you to do some soul searching before you continue to defend traitors. History will not remember his supporters in a compassionate light. '
'That’s kinda what I’m thinking. What would be worst case scenario of collusion?'
"It wouldn't be unreasonable to work outside in .. MBS is going to be in power a LONG time (assuming no coup or untimely death). There are plenty of incentives for Saudi to fully cooperate (reduce support to Wahabi and do business deals with Israel).\n\nThat said, Kushner was there the week before slew of politically motivated arrests and right around the forced resignation of Lebanon's PM. There is also Saudi's war in Yemen.\n\nIf Kushner sanctioned any of these actions, it violates the US post-Cold war policies favoring direct democracy. The timing is suspect that he wouldn't have known. Under normal circumstances, he should feel ashamed - instead US citizens have to feel shame on his behalf."

"Yes, fellow cuck.  You see, Jared was part of the globalist(Jew) liberal conspiracy all along and was working as a double agent for Hillary Clinton.  He was based out of Comet Pizza's kiddie rape dungeon basement working in close coordination with the reverse vampire witches casting spells to force Trump and everyone who worked for him to commit treason going back years.  Pepe tried to counter this with his meme magic but unfortunately he succumbed to the spirit cooking and has flipped as a witness for Bob Mueller who was appointed by Vladimir Putin, Trump's mortal enemy."

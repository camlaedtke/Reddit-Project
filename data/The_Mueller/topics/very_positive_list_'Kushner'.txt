"Of course. He isn't perfect but I still believe he is the best from what we had to pick from."
'I mean when you have a President who does nothing but order and eat fast food, you probably have a lot of free time to read and stay up to date on world events.'
"Kyle's the one with the vestigial third arm growing out of the side of his neck, which is rumoured to have very, very neat handwriting."
"His dad's actually the chief calligrapher at the white house. Fun fact, Kyle actually has a higher security clearance than Jared Kushner."
'For the last 2 years I have had political discussions at work with a Dr. who supported Trump.  Always jokingly he would come by and speak in his thick Chinese American accent broadcasting that I am a bleeding heart liberal and laugh.  Always falling back on the Hillary argument.  I kept insisting to him that I’m not to the far left but I was registered Independent and have some conservative views and some liberal, what I like to amount to a overall common sense strong moral view.  One day I finally asked him what he thought of the Paul Manafort situation.  He didn’t even know who Paul Manafort was.  I was speechless.  '
"Wow those names are super good evidence I can't believe I never picked up on this!! The Sam Clovis bonus name is the nail in the coffin. That name just sounds super shady. I bet some of them like, talked to a Russian once or twice in their lives too. Well, better lock everyone up for treason now glad that's over."
'What counts as "Trump Russia collusion?"  Does Trump have to personally be writing e-mails or something?  As we have learned, Trump did very little personal correspondence and instead used people like Hope Hicks as the person to communicate his wishes.\n\nAt the end of the day, the entire base of Trump\'s pyramid and several layers up have been identified as compromised by - or conspiring with - Russians.  The depth of their actions we haven\'t fully been exposed to, admittedly, but with a base so full of holes, how can we honestly say Trump had no idea?'
'It seems like everyone on this board is on a grand jury.  '
'I sure hope so. '
"Dude even the glorious Fox News has said Uranium One isn't a real scandal at this point."
'Ah, Russian trolls love to masturbate to Trump. The timeless tale continues'
'That sounds like a good way to fall asleep.'
'How can we tell what the support actually is, if like you say, dissent is crushed promptly? That certainly has a chilling effect on the true numbers of satisfaction with their government. I prefer to err on the side of good intent until proven otherwise. \n\nWith that said, people do tend to be motivated by perceived national embarrassment, and support politicians who call it out and who promise reprisal. Mao sought to rectify Chinese historical embarrassments, as did the nazis, and most recently Trumpism. So the point that Russians distain Americans is valid, but I’m more inclined to think the support for America in Russia is undersold for various motives.'

'Well, I do post on t_d, not going to argue that. Being people of justice, as you all are here in t_m, you should be concerned that our our DOJ and FBI are illegally granting warrants to spy on political opposition. No? '
'The Simpson testimony released yesterday.  This is the bit I"m referring to:\n\n"The Turkey-Russia connection I think is\n\ndeeper than is generally understood. I think that the Turkey-Russia -- I think that\nthe influence campaign that General Flynn got caught up In is reflective of that.\nAnd I think it\'s not been excavated. And I think that Roger Stone may have\nconnections to that matter that are unexplored.\nMR. SCHIFF: Why do you say that?\nMR. SIMPSON: Things I heard from sources.\n\nI think Ted Malloch is an\n\nimportant person in this whole picture. And he may have had some role in all\nthat.\n\nHe is an interesting person who crosses over from Brexit, UKIP, Trump, and\n\nthe Turkey-Russia issue.\n\nAnd then the last thing I would add is, you know, we\n\nhaven\'t talked about Deutsche Bank at all. You know, I think they obviously know\na fair bit.\n\nBut they are obviously within your subpoena power, and I am assuming\n\nyou probably already asked them to provide information."\n\n\n'

"You think that a huge multinational bank is going to launch an investigation due to the request of a 3rd party private investigator firm?

'Qatar is an ally (we have major bases there). I image many of our allies are holding back at least some information, partly to protect their sources and assets. Well that will make the country safer.'
'>So why does Kushner still have any level of clearance? Holy shit!\n\nTwo things:\n\n1. Sensitive Compartmented Information is not accessible to everyone with a security clearance of a given level.  It has to be authorized on a need to know basis.\n\n2. Because of #1, my guess is that the FBI wants to see what things Trump will grant Kushner "need to know" when he clearly does not... and they\'ll add that to the complete picture of Trump\'s activities.'
'I take offense at that. People who wash dishes in soup kitchens are usually pretty good people. I see no evidence Trump has ever volunteered any time to help other people in his entire life.'
"Oh god I hope you are correct with #2.  But is anyone  reporting  to proper non-corrupt agents what Jared is getting access to?  I am well aware  there are proper  protocols but the Trump  administration  does not give a damn about  proper protocol. Didn't  a CIA agent  recently say this was the most corrupt administration he's ever seen? \n"
"Israel created duqu 2.0 to spy on Hillary Clinton and the Iran deal, JCPOA. Russia found Israel's malware and used it too. So both Israel and Russia were in state systems and using it to influence our democracy. Russia's online army is 1/10th Israel's. Through AIPAC israelis gave nearly 180 million to the election. Trump met the Russian lawyer and Netanyahu all in the same time then shortly after clibton and the dncs dirt got put out. Israel already had everything wikileaks and DCLeaks had from spying on the Iran deal. Russia would of had it too after finding Israel's Kaspersky flaw. Since trump won, russia hasn't had sanctions installed. Israel got Jerusalem, a 18% increase in free American money, the UN changed so no one is hokding Israel accountable for their take over of Palestine, and has got almost full control over the Iran deal to dictate it on ameticas behalf. Also, Russia Israeli trade and business has gone up 12% since all of this 😤"
">But is anyone reporting to proper non-corrupt agents what Jared is getting access to?\n\nProbably not... but my educated guess is Mueller knows, regardless.  \n\n> CIA agent recently say this was the most corrupt administration he's ever seen?\n\nIf I recall correctly, it wasn't just a CIA agent. It was former Director of Central Intelligence John Brennan.\n\n"
"People, yes. But he didn't volunteer; they showered him in cash like a Russian hooker. "
'They likely will play the ‘we wanted to stop him but the Democrats wouldn’t let us’ card.  \n\nThat will play well with the NeverTrump Republicans, and will seem plausible as an escape hatch for the Trumpians who want out. '
'Pence would be poor candidate. He would carry the baggage of the impeachent/resignation and not have the advantage of running a an incumbent (this cost Ford). Unlike Trump he\'s a poor public speaker, uncharismatic. He\'s not very competent, he\'s an religious extremist. He would lose.\n\nIf Trump runs he will probably be re-elected (do not wish this but it is what it ise) *if* the economy holds up. Advantages:\n\n* Generally, people get tired of Party X if it\'s been in power for eight years or more. The new party then is usually given a full eight years before the people get tired of *them*. The one exception is Carter (before that, Grover Cleveland, and I\'m not even sure about that). This greatly favors Trump.\n\n* Remember, some people voted for Al Gore but then decided "Well, after seeing George W. Bush\'s first term, I\'m switching to him" (!) If *George Bush* can do this then Trump can.\n\n* Trump is a *terrible* President, but he\'s an excellent public speaker and a good campaigner.\n\n* We can assume the same treatment from Russian bots and trolls, and the same voter suppression. An maybe the Russians can hack the voting machines,\n\nIf the economy tanks, Trump will lose anyway. If it\'s pretty good, he\'ll probably win. If there\'s a big Muslim terrorist attack in America near the election, he will win in a landslide. Pence would probably lose.'
'Well, he was asked if it affected the election and he said he wouldn\'t get into the impact, but they didn\'t see evidence that votes were changed.\n\nUnder the way he\'s defining it, he\'s allowing that enough Americans may have chosen Trump or shown up for Trump because of propaganda that it put him over the top, but they aren\'t even attempting to assess that.  I sincerely don\'t know if I believe him or not, but I can understand why they might not get into such a tough hypothetical questions like "Would people have elected Trump anyway absent Russian propaganda".'
"If Trump is removed I doubt Pence would even run. \n\n> excellent public speaker\n\nTrump is a terrible public speaker by any objective measure. He rambles endlessly and can barely form a coherent sentence. BING BING BING. I'll grant that his speaking is POPULAR with his base.\n\nThe investigation is still a big wild card. Anything could happen."
'That sounds like a big number, but look at his razor thin victory margin and his abysmal public approval rating. Primaries are decided by party loyalists but generals are decided by independents and swing voters.\n\nBesides, the other shoe has yet to drop. '
'Well i mean popular *is* good, almost by definition, when you\'re talking about public speaking with the intent to persuade. \n\nTrump has a way of ending statements with like "...and it\'s very, very easy. We\'re going to do it and we\'re going to do it very quickly". He drops his pitch and volume in a "turning away" way that communicates "I mean of course we\'re going to do it. That\'s so obviously true that it\'s really not even worth saying. Only an idiot can\'t see that. You\'re not a idiot, are you?" It\'s the equivalent of a math professor handwaving with "...and after that, the solution is trivial".\n\nJust because he\'s a bad *person* doesn\'t mean he\'s a bad *campaigner*. He is. I mean Hitler was an effective public speaker too.'
"Hitler's skill as an orator puts Trump to absolute shame. They're not even in the same league. You don't even have to speak German to grok the difference, e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnpTWKKWQ1o He's one of history's greatest monsters but he's also a damn good orator.\n\nWhat they DO have in common in their speaking is the effective use of [demagoguery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogue).\n\n*better video"
"I won't discount the possibility that he wins another term. I won't even discount the possibility that he calls for a violent revolt, or moves to amend the constitution to eliminate presidential term limits and fixes however many elections he lives for. I didn't think he had a chance in hell of being president but here he is in all his orange glory. I'm confident things will get better, somebody, but they could get a lot worse in the meantime.\n\nThis is interesting reading, and slightly comforting, given that demagogues historically usually come to bad end, but discomforting to think about who they take with them https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogue"
'Here\'s the original video of Trump saying "Russia if you\'re listening" -- along with followup questions from reporters -- it\'s 100% clear Trump wasn\'t joking:\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/video/watch-trump-call-on-russia-to-find-clinton-s-emails-tell-reporter-to-be-quiet-733375555707\n\nOne of the most interesting details of the Cohen development -- other than TRUMP FUCKING KNEW (which really has been obvious all along) -- is that this leak appears to NOT have come from Cohen or his team.\n\nIf it came from Trump\'s team, he must be pretty damn desperate.'
'>"I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week, and we\'re going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons," Trump said during a speech after winning the California, Montana, New Mexico, South Dakota and New Jersey primaries. "I think you\'re going to find it very informative and very, very interesting. I wonder if the press will want to attend. Who knows?" \n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2017/07/11/politics/trump-campaign-june-9/index.html\n\nThe speech, of course, never took place. And it\'s extremely clear that Trump said the above expecting to get dirt from the Trump Tower meeting, and then never gave the speech because the Russians didn\'t give him any dirt on Hillary.'

"I still don't think of Trump as anything other than a b-list celebrity. Which he would consider the greatest insult."
'Reddit please do better '
'Damn. This is the best description I’ve ever seen of the damage inflicted on our country. I’m totally using this is my debates with family. \n\n“...defaces foundation ideals of our country and destroys gains made through the sacrifice of the lives of good Americans.” \n\nBrilliant!!'
'I agree with your statement also. We will survive this presidency. Our underlying values remain true. \n\nIt is my opinion that Trump’s actions are disrespecting the sacrifices made through his blatant disrespect for the office he holds. '
"You don't think, without zero evidence, that people may be overreacting about this? Snoop Dog was another investor and r/Trees has been booming on reddit for a while now, maybe Reddit admins are doing that to make Snoop happy. Oh wait, we have zero evidence of that. Get what I'm saying?\n\nAlso yeah, totally not worth keeping on the site. On the other hand, acting like they do and stretching truth to get what we want isn't healthy. I refuse to act like they do just to get what I want."
'When you have the level of wealth that JK has, all family business is in your best interest. '
'Trump is truly a reprehensible, sniveling trust fund shit. Luckily there\'s not much he can do that the next POTUS can\'t undo. "B-b-but nuclear war!!!" Luckily our military leaders have the discretion to ignore his pushing the button like some cartoon character.'
"The irony is fucking hilarious! And if you don't want comment replies pointing out your revisionism don't make comments supporting the alt right in a sub that's dedicated to following someone who will hopefully bring their leader down."
"Actually yes it does. At least in that case, the reddit connection would have nothing to do with the face that he invested in the company. Which would make this article entirely pointless wouldn't it? It might be in reddits best interest not to piss of trump, but it doesn't have anything to do with the fact that Josh Kushner invested in it."
'Translation for impact and clarity: "The President\'s senior advisor SON-IN-LAW has security clearance downgraded"\n\nLet\'s hope we never have to see a headline like that again.'
"Jared don't start blushing, but I think Mueller's got eyes for you. Happy belated Valentines Day buddy. Enjoy ;)"
'BUT HOW IS HE GOING TO MAKE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST NOW?!?'
'If the downgrade was not signed by Chief of Staff, does it even work? Also, he was downgraded from "top secret" to "secret" — should we really count it as a big win? :('
'Apparently Secret is basic, like clipped newspaper articles that might reveal a person of interest, that kind of level.\n\nOne thing is clear if it’s a legit downgrade he can no longer do his job, you need all the intel the other side has to be an effective negotiator/representative.'
'While this is true, Sensitive Compartmented Information is declassified to individuals on a "need to know" basis.  Even persons with Top Secret clearance must individually have a "need to know" the specific intelligence that\'s in the document.\n\nSo, the fact that the President, under Dept. of the Navy v. Egan, has broad powers to determine "need to know" is a bit of a trap... the more intel that Trump declassifies to Kushner in cases where he *clearly* does not have a need to know will only tangibly hurt Trump\'s credibility (Mueller may present it before a Judge or Grand Jury to demonstrate a pattern of conspiracy) and raise the suspicions of all around him... This will also increase the probability of more rats turning on Trump.'
'That and the fact he’s nearly bankrupt from buying666 Fifth Ave. at the peak of the Real Estate Bubble.  Pretty easy for a friendly Russian oligarch to buy a son-in-law.\n\nETA: just saw [this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/kushners-overseas-contacts-raise-concerns-as-foreign-officials-seek-leverage/2018/02/27/16bbc052-18c3-11e8-942d-16a950029788_story.html) article; at least 4 governments were discussing ‘manipulating’ the guy.'

'Applicable username.  3 indictments, 1 confirmed witness flip and 2 more obvious ones incoming.  He literally went to Jared to pressure Mike Flynn which means Flynn has at least some of the goods.  What bias, BTW?  Mueller is a Republican, who was appointed FBI Director by George W. Bush (a Republican), appointed by Rod Rosenstein (a Republican) and enjoys support from almost all Republican members of Congress.  Maybe leave the_Dumbass and Fox News for 5 seconds and you\'ll be able to see that the process is working as it should.     \nI want to tell you as a New Yorker, if you don\'t think Trump has skeletons in his closet working in NY real estate, you\'ve got another thing coming entirely.  Anything Mueller digs up as a result of the Russia investigation (money laundered apartments in Trump Tower and double-book-value real estate deals to Russian oligarchs in Palm Beach) are fair game.  Good luck.\n     \nI can tell this story is definitely:     \n[](#b8)     \n\nWelcome!  I look forward to many "debates" with you.'
'It’s more than that. It’s psychological warfare. It was hacking political opponents of Trump in collusion with Trump Campaign officials. It was a quid pro quo. We help you get elected through propaganda influence, hacking campaign officials of your opponents if you ease sanctions on Russia. If you don’t let us help you, well we have these incriminating documents about you.'
"That video actually captures 2016 for me quite nicely.  An insane year I don't think any of us will forget or care to live again.  It was amusing for maybe a week and then it started to get batshit insane."
'>As a conspiracy theorist\n\nI wouldn\'t identify as a conspiracy theorist but at this point we *know* the government is spying on everything we do. I can\'t see how anyone can trust the government. \n\n>batshit crazy political correctness, social justice warriors and the new insane direction of feminism\n\nI hear you. Social justice is a good thing and I believe all people deserve equality. I think most people feel that way too. I\'d say don\'t let some idiots on Tumblr taint your view of this but with colleges planning "Whites stay home day" (or whatever it was called) it\'s hard to say it\'s just Tumblr. \n\n\nYou seem like a fairly reasonable person so I have to ask. \n\nWhat is it about Trump that you support? What has he done to earn your support? '
'That deal is such a diversion from your dear leader. No uranium has left the United States because it’s against the law. Furthermore uranium isn’t some precious resource.\n\nDude, you’re so delusional! Do you have no thoughts on the fact that the campaign had visited with Russia on numerous occasions? That DT jr. has emails discussing COLLUSION with the Russian government? Or the number of times Sessions has perjured himself over this shit?\n\nYou’re lost dude. '
'You do have to understand that your perception is being peppered by the media you consume.  I don\'t agree with the "did you just assume their gender?" outrage SJW people, either.  I don\'t approve of the violent Antifa nuts, nor do I approve of the Brown Shirts on the other side.  I do, however, agree with respecting people\'s right to declare their gender because it costs us nothing and gives them a chance to be who they are.  There were studies where they did autopsies on transgender people and they found a specific element in their brain only found in the opposite gender, so their feeling is not altogether wrong, scientifically.  I\'m a big believer in kindness and acceptance because this world is harsh enough as it is to everyone.      \nI would also caution you from taking on a political philosophy based upon the behavior and actions of fringe groups.  There are bigger things at work like healthcare, the tax code & basic human rights in play, here.  We all basically want the same things for the most part (jobs, prosperity & peace), we just disagree upon the route to get them.'
'It is fascinating! I’m glad you’re taking an interest, that’s the first step to realizing that you’re wrong.'
"Said the person who regularly posts to a Trump cult echo chamber that bans people for questioning the cult narrative.\n\nLol\n\nPlease note that you won't be banned here for debating... You'll just get laughed at heartily and repeatedly..."
'hope he likes cock meat sandwich!'
"Very good points and i agree with you whole heartedly about us having a hand in creating (and hopefully helping to fix) this mess. But he definetely knew let's not pretend he didn't. Just another example of this administration misleading the public. "
'The Middle East is a very complex situation that\'s been around for ages. One man is not going to fix it. What he is doing is just causing more instability in the region. And one more point, even if he was tasked with "fixing the middle east" the way he is going about it ie; behind the backs of the intelligence community and others, is not the way to accomplish peace in the Middle East.'
'Makes me happy too. The nature of this sub is sort of an echo chamber, so this is nice to see. '
'That said, the 20th century order caused much of the instability. Jews, Coptic Christians and Muslims lived side by side for centuries prior to colonialism in places like Palestine (now mostly Isreal) and Egypt. \n\nThe British and French just drew borders on convenience, the British engineered the seething mass that was Mandatory Palestine, and the US used its economic might to force through the UN resolution leading to the State of Israel.\n\nIMO - if we (collective) had a hand in breaking it, we have a certain responsibility to help fix it (productively - not the Kushner way)'
"Always good advice.  Mueller keeps it **CRIMINAL** though, and I'm more than fine with that."
"*probably* but not certain.  Could also be a troll.  A journalist would have no good motive for anonymously scooping themselves on Reddit.  A troll would have lots of reasons to set themselves down in our camp, gain our trust and start telling us stories.  I know we are all desperate for some definitive news that this will all be over soon, but Bob Mueller is on the job so just be patient and let Justice take it's course.  In the mean time, we can all do our part by keeping our cool and continuing to fiercely exercise our critical thinking skills. "
'you mean they actually do their job sometimes? XD'
'Yes... that guy predicted paradise papers'
"> One source said the nature of this conversation was principally to make sure Kushner doesn't have information that exonerates Flynn. \n\nInteresting! But if Flynn's already struck a deal, exoneration should already a lost opportunity for him.\n\nMaybe they're still talking terms and Flynn's attorneys are being vague about possible exculpatory evidence. So this could be Mueller seeing if it really exists from the relevant folks who could provide it (or try to surprise Mueller with it later, publicly and dramatically)."

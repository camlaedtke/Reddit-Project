After seeing Michael Cohen (Trump’s personal lawyer) say today he’ll plead the 5th in the Stormy Daniels case, and Trump has said this in the past: “The mob takes the Fifth. If you're innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?”
Russian state TV hosts brazenly assert, “Trump is ours,” and joke that the U.S. lawmakers traveled to Russia “to make deals with our hackers, so they can rig the midterms in favor of Trump’s team.”
'Quote from Rudy Giuliani “Donald, I never represented him, because he considers a legal bill the first offer in a negotiation, you don’t want to represent somebody like that.” http://www.economicpolicyjournal.com/2016/02/donald-trumps-bill-paying-ways.html'
'Better call Saul!'
'Please trump. Please represent yourself. You can DO it!'
'Just look at the people who *are* representing him and the mistakes they’re making. They are like cartoons. It’s amazing how much people can lie to themselves to think this piece of shit is somehow innocent or even competent.'
"Chances are a lawyer won't be *your* lawyer if they realise it means they'll be needing their *own* lawyer somewhere down the road..."
"Aww, more Trump news, I'm afraid it seems he's immune, he could be school shooter and an army of Trumpers come to his defense"
'There smart enough not to go against the Mueller!!'
"If he was innocent he'd need only one lawyer."
'He just hires whoever agrees with him on Fox news.'
"> according to reports   \n\nHere's a free clue kids.  If the story does not **name the source,** it's false.  \n\nBan me.  \n\n"
'That was a beautiful post.\n'
"> I'm beginning to think that maybe Sean Hannity is full of shit.\n\nHe is a Trump supporter, so yeah."
"It's not even really a question of guilt or innocence. Kushner is guilty af but he's got one of the best lawyers in DC. The problem is Trump has 0 discipline, won't listen to advice (in fact actively shirks it seemingly) and makes witnesses out of his attorneys. They don't like that shit."
"> every decent lawyer in the country should be clamoring to represent him.\n\nThey are - it's those who have a shitler leftist reputation to consider who choose not too.. Hello? Common Sense? At what point did you become stupid enough in life to have respect for lawyers of all people? Jesus Christ you are a young and naive millennial. Pretty stupid position to take and anyone on the left or the right can agree with that. Nice dreamworld where lawyers are goodguys though champ."
'Saul is smart enough to not take this one.'
"Fine I'll watch it already jeeeze! "
"What do you call a bus of lawyers at the bottom of the ocean? Trump's last chance to get legal representation "
"I'll accept a plea deal on his behalf; in exchange for not having to be President anymore, my client agrees to be locked away forever right after his nuts have been stamped into paste."
"Trump's lawyer has a lawyer, this is reaching inception levels of recursion."
"I think the CNN debate with Daniel's attorney is still the best. They were like two caged pitbulls snapping at each other's throats. This is the real deal Trump era debate strategy: send your lawyer to attack the other guy's lawyer in a multi-million dollar cockfight."
'"He was trying to help you." \n\n'
"Trump is an end stage human mistake. You people will be lucky to live through him. He's a grand mal seizure for an entire country."
'Stormy Daniels is the hero this country deserves.'
"I'd like to see him do an interview with Chelsea Handler"
'Can someone clear up something for me:\n\nWho is actually representing Cohen on this? My understanding is that David is his *friend* but not his attorney of record on this.'
'why is this lawyer on talkshows making a case?  How will this help him in the court room?'
'this dude is classic stupid lmao!!! '
'All jokes aside is this not fairly normal practice,\nI feel it’s normal to have a team of lawyers. '
'Isn’t this the problem, though? By that I mean valuing entertainment over rational debate.'
'Takes a lot to get disbarred. \n\nGenerally it would be for fucking with your clients money, commingling funds things like that. \n'
"The perfect metaphor for what's going on "
"Don't be so smug -- fallout goes everywhere."
'I remember that, On the Anderson Cooper show, he was introduced as the lawyer and friend of Cohen. '
"She cares about nobody but herself. She was a willing and eager talking puppet for years, repeating all of the most illogical, hateful, one-sided nonsense that that the Fox News wing of the Republican party could squeeze out. She deserves no respect, ever. She's just as soulless as any other Fox News sociopath."
'"I think I may have committed a little ... *light* treason"'
'>“This inquiry from you about whether I am doing this is a good example of why we need one.”\n\nOhh, so edgy.'
'More like he knows he is about to be indicted. '
'This guy is a squealer to be sure. I’ll bet that if he gets indicted, he’ll divorce Ivanka '
'He pardons kushner. Gets indicted pence becomes president and then Arnold smith donates for a trump pardon. '
'Cushy gushy Whoopie cushion Kushner.\nI like it.'
'Totally looks like Damien.\n"What have you done to it\'s eyes!?!"'
'I wonder what it feels like to be brain-dead.'
"Are they trying to influence potential jurors if it gets to that stage? That's really all that can come of it to help him - unless I'm missing something?"
'Pardons are a thing. They could spin this so much with what-aboutisms, being "innocent", "witchunting" etc.. '
'If only he had the FBI to willingly change the language before the investigation was finished like members of Muellers team did for Hillary.'
'I seriously hope he gets someone as competent as Barry Zuckercorn.'
'Solid as a rock!'
"I'd like the see the text messages between the GOP members when they were investigating HRC all those years for Benghazi. \n\nWhen Mueller found out, he removed them. Also, Mueller is allowed to cast his net as long as their is corruption, and there is A LOT of it."
'I was under the impression they changed the language to match their conclusions. Are you saying you think the FBI was in the tank for Hillary Clinton? '
"First time I saw a picture of D. Trump Jr I thought, wow, that is actual real GOB Bluth right there. I don't follow this drama too closely, but from what I've seen, he has not disappointed."
'ISSIS is gone super quick too. Glad that problem is solved. DT 2, terrorists 0'
'Why would someone need 7 lawyers? Honest question. '
'Really? Do you have an article link by any chance? '
'Ok, so you think that Mueller is ok then? '
'That’s I what I thought too. Like since when are these guys not allowed to have opinions. '
'Perfect '
'Awesome, I’m excited. '
"lol how's that reality working out for you?"
'I was under the impression public opinion didn’t matter any more '
'I wish I could upvote this twice '
'Legal work is mostly paperwork, and going through large volumes of material and scrutinizing it to try and put together a defense against all potential lines of argument takes a lot of time and manpower. You can’t overlook anything. Most lawyers have their own staff to help manage the workload. \n\nMy only guess as to why 7 may be necessary (Again IIRC) is that Flynn has vast legal vulnerabilities on a scale comparable to a large corporation. \\*shrug\\*'
'What a coincidence that they find this now, now that the fusion GPS testimony is out and their integrity called into question. '
'>The information has been transmitted by Deutsche Bank to the German Financial Supervisory Authority Bafin. They are also to approach the US special investigator Robert Mueller, who is researching possible security-related financial ties of the Trump clan - including Russia.'
'Well, if previous behavior is any indication, Mueller will take an interest in this, and if there’s substantial evidence of criminal activity, he’ll do the same thing he did with Flynn and Manafort: indict him and give him the choice to cooperate in exchange for dropping some charges. In that case, Kushner will sing like a canary. I don’t think he’s really that smart, but he’s a member of the trump family clan, so there’s a good chance he’s privy to any of Trump’s worst campaign transgressions.'
'Surprise!  Germans want to help democrats go after a Jew!'
"Wow, that's the exact same reaction of a totally different person earlier in the thread, like word for word! What a very strange coincidence comrade!"
'Yeah, you should eat more of that fruit, it’ll help rid the country of your idiocy. '
'What in the testimony makes you think their integrity is called into question?'
'“Our” lol. \n\n\\>insinuating you’re American '
"You mean your FSB and Ministry of Justice, don't you comrade?"
"Giving you the benefit of the doubt: having worked in money laundering detection, it's extremely unlikely that DB didn't already know of these connections. Banks have lots of big data analytical tools and are mandated, at least in the US, to know their customer's business."
'Once Trump is either indicted or impeached, you should do an AMA about what it was like working at a troll farm!'
'Sure comrade'
'Deal. And if it turns out the the FBI, DOJ, and other top officials acted illegally in obtaining FISA warrants to spy on American citizens you do an AMA on t_d and declare that you are a CNN/ WAPO shill. Deal? '
"I'm not saying that never happened, I'll wait for hard evidence on that. Trying to use this to try to discredit the Trump/Russia investigation is laughable though. Also, Nunes doesn't really have a track record of being the most honest person, so you'll understand that I won't just take his word. "
'What do I need? I need any evidence of Russian collusion. Any. Please. You referred to 4 indictments and 2 guilty please. None of these are related to so called "Russian collusion". None. \n\nMy neighbor was fined for not paying a parking ticket. Let me guess, that is proof enough for you. '
"I'm sure he quit because of how innocent Trump is, right?"
'> [Trump] has also privately insisted he should sit for an interview with the special counsel’s office, even though Mr. Dowd believed it was a bad idea.\n\n[source](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/us/politics/john-dowd-resigns-trump-lawyer.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news)\n\nOh my god. Please let this interview actually happen. I cannot wait to see Trump incriminate himself.'
'When the lawyers **Nope Out**... and they get paid win OR lose.'
'Yeah, like fleas fleeing a sinking rat. '
'For reference, he was hired by Trump in June 2017.  And he probably quit rather than allow himself to be fired.'
'Wonder if at the end of 4 years he will be all alone in the White House, crazy like Howard Hughes, and just checking his ratings and tweeting stuff to garner as much attention as possible. He only cares about the spotlight and will do anything at all to keep it.'
'it will be remembered about as well as Watergate is remembered. There will be some movies about it, it will be mentioned in the history books. The main focus will be how polarizing this era is, and how easily mis-information was spread. \n\nOne topic of discussion will be how people were ignorant before the internet because the lack of information, this era will be known for people being ignorant because we have TOO much information and we can pick and choose what best works for us. '
'This will be the first movie "based on a true story" that won\'t have to be embellished.'
'It\'ll read like Genesis.\n\n"And Mueller got-got Flynn.  And Mueller got-got Spicer. And Mueller got-got Priebus.  And Mueller got-got Bannon.  And Mueller got-got Gorka.  And Mueller got-got Porter.  And Mueller got-got Hicks.  And Mueller got-got Cohn.  And Mueller got-got McEntee.  And Mueller got-got Tillerson. And Mueller got-got Dowd."'
'Same here. \n\nI\'m a bit disappointed in myself that it took things to become this "dire" to feel like my participation matters, but better late than never, I figure.'
'Please let this mean Trump sits for Mueller.'

'"Everything is fine now. My work is done here."'
"It's good energy. Very high energy.\n\nThis is just how high energy administrations work. \n\nDo you remember how boring the Obama administration was? You could have slept through it. Very low energy. Now Americans are on the edge of their seats every single day.\n\nThis presidency will have the highest ratings ever, believe me."
"We're Lawyers :) "
'Shhh, let trump keep thinking that he’s smarter. It’s O.K.'
'the movies are going to be hilarious'
'Confirmation bias is huge! '
"It's been recorded in much greater detail this time around. Granular detail, one might say."
'It would be awesome if he did, and then fires him for being mean. After clearly and obviously lying several times.'
"Nah, Hot Pockets are pretty dumb. They're just not as racist, so it's an understandable mistake."
'Do you know lawyers often don’t take cases they can’t win, right? '
"The best part is that pleading the fifth is pretty meaningless and actually a bit damaging in a civil case like the Stormy Daniels case. All it does is stop Mueller (and other prosecutors) from having more evidence to use in a criminal trial.\n\nBut in the civil trial, the jury / judge is free to assume that him pleading the 5th means that he did whatever he's being asked about."
'He fine just send him to Belize 🇧🇿 '
"I'd almost wish they'd troll him by quoting his own client, but that would be beneath Mueller's clean cut operation."
"All this talk on twitter about how pleading the fifth doesn't mean you're guilty.  Yeah, you're right.  And if the entire world were lawyers it might mean something.  But as it stands when you plead the fifth you look really, really... REALLY guilty."
"Plead the fifth. Or tell the truth ...\n\nWhat's it gonna be, tough guy?"
'Better for him to drink a fifth. And keep drinking.'
'Jesus Christ, you people are like an infestation. Go crawl back under the rock from which you came.'
'IIRC you can only plead the Fifth you’re actually in danger of being criminally charged. So if you’re given immunity, you can’t plead the Fifth — you’re not in criminal jeopardy. This is also how we know that Mueller has almost certainly told Cohen to expect an indictment soon.'
'> This is also how we know that Mueller has almost certainly told Cohen to expect an indictment soon.\n\nGood point.  That makes sense.'
'Sorry dude but this is incorrect.  You don\'t need to "plead the 5th"  just do not answer their questions.  If they drag you in front of a grand jury or subpoena you then you can exert your 5th amendment rights.\n\nIn an unrelated note - don\'t ever talk to the police.  Ever.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/d-7o9xYp7eE\n\n'
'Thats gonna make me smile for the rest of the week'

Matt Gaetz (R-FL)\n\nRep. Scott DesJarlais (R-TN)\n\n\nDon't forget their names. Make sure they lose their seats, and make sure they end up in prison. After the midterms, make it clear that accountability is a priority. "
"That's a relief. I was so afraid of the consequences of that."
'/r/The_Rosenstein held his ground and the traitors backed off!!!'
"Idk, I'd be personally surprised if Republicans impeach him while in power, regardless of what they find on Trump."
'Even if ALL of the Republicans want to impeach him, they still need the backing of some democrats in order to impeach Rosenstein. Plus Paul Ryan seems VERY much against impeaching him. He isn’t running for reelection so he has no constituents he needs to keep happy and I think he has decided he wants to leave politics being anti-Trump. Everyone with half a brain has realized or is realizing how horrible Trump supporters are going to look in a few years. '
'And secure voting. With paper trails'
'Be interested how many of them are up for reelection this midterm, and how pro trump their area is. Once they get the republican nomination they will step back.'
"I don't have much knowledge on this, what convinced you?"
'The CFO of Trump org is under scrutiny and a judge is allowing a case about emoluments to go forward. Both of these have a strong potential to uncover snippets of his personal finances.\n\nI could find some sources later if you want'

'Well, they clearly cared more about the hype of the memo than what they thought the actual effect of releasing the memo would be.\n\nYou don\'t release something on the Friday before Superbowl if you really expect it to be something.\n\nNow people will be distracted enough for them to just keep repeating "memo, memo" without people scrutinizing what was actually in it.'
"FISA warrants are granted at such a high rate because they are only applied for when they know with a high likelihood that it will be approved. Why apply for a case if you know it likely won't get the go-ahead?"
"He says he didn't have a hand in writing it, and he's the only R on the committee who's actually read the intel -- not Nunes. Even if he did help actually write it, it's meaningful that he disclaims it now. That might make his refusal to own it even more significant."

'Also proves trump was in bed with russia, and theres pretty much no way he could not have known'
'That’s like saying my microwave burrito and the surface of the sun are both hot. It’s a question of degrees. '
'I would say its inevitable. Firing Mueller would have zero effect on this case as Mueller is not prosecuting this case, but his office and either Mueller or his successor will receive the benefits (evidence) and a witness (Cohen) that can be pretty powerful against Trump, and he can do nothing, even the illegal promise of a pardon would not help in that it will ensure that some counts would be prosecuted at the state level. Even states have campaign contribution laws. However the evidence and even the venue may not support a prosecution of Cohen or Trump. I think though, the presecution of the abuse of the Taxi medallions, if they can rise to a felony level, will be prosecuted at the State or local level, although I am not sure of the penalties.'

'I trust Mueller to do the right thing.  The rest of the political clowns, not so much.'
"I think he'll do what right for the case, but we shouldn't assume it will be what's best for the country. I don't think he's going to publicly air findings that aren't directly related to an indictment, and I think we desperately need that."
'At this point none of his base would believe the truth even if it bit them on the balls.'
"Yet, I'll bet, if Trump disrespected NASCAR, Ranch Dressing, or anime his base would turn on him in a heartbeat.\n\nSide note:  I'd like to again suggest [Chris Burke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Burke_(actor) to play Trump when this is made into a movie"
'Nixon had supporters even after he resigned.'
"Mueller better hurry breh, Trump is 'bout to unleash his entire agenda on the populace in 2018."
'I mean, he was at least within the bounds of a “normal” president. He acted more or less like presidents before him did, unlike trump.'
'Obviously. To do anything else would be to effectively end the rule of law.'
'Should we be signing petitions to show our support for ~~net neutrality~~the mueller investigation? You know cause we the people...'
'Just enjoying the bigotry'
"Personally, I don't think trump was involved in collusion, although members of his staff clearly were. The issue is him trying to cover for them, and hide what happened  because it threatens his view of his legitimacy. You would be insane to say that he hasn't attempted to hamper this investigation, and that is an incredibly dangerous thing to do. Please, for the love of  god, stand up for yourself and hold him accountable. You have to be better than this. "

'Why bother rigging the midterms?  GOP is all in with a Traitor now.  They\'ll ask Putin to amp up the attacks, then make a grand statement like :\n\n"In the interests of preserving our election integrity, we are forced to suspend elections due to foreign interference."\n\nThen the US is truly dead.'
"Yeah.  I'm moving to Mexico in October.  Good luck."
'And twenty-six others.  I encourage everyone to read them all.'
"Oh, hadn't considered that as a possible route.  Interesting.  Makes more sense from the attorney's standpoint than being the mouthpiece of a pardon-threat."
"It makes sense that Mueller's holding onto his cards until Cohen and Manafort fall.  Once those two burn down, he'll have a clear path to start rolling out phase 2."
">Also, a pardon would be worse for Trump. Without being able to invoke the 5th, Cohen may be even more talkative.\n\nHey, that's a good point.  Probably why they're keeping state charges hidden.  Pardon him federally and he's required to run his mouth because he's pleading guilty."

"Exactly. If Mueller concludes that Trump is innocent of any lawbreaking, I'll be absolutely shocked, but I'll believe it.\n\nAnd then I'll continue calling for impeachment for the billion other atrocities he's committed against my country."

"Yeah, because it still goes on the record and is published.  This happens all the time actually; sometimes they don't even actually give the speech they just hand the transcript to the Speaker."
"as to the empty floor, just reading his speech into the official record. Pretty common tactic with as many congressman who want to give speeches as there are. Ain't nobody got time to sit through all of that. "
"I do have to wonder if there wasn't some complicity in the very least some knowledge of improprieties with members of Congress that's making some folks nervous.\n\nThey certainly don't have any issues with the various ethical lapses and emolument abuses or any of the umpteen things that the administration does that are beneath the dignity of the office."
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Rohrabacher\n\nIt is so bad with Rohrabacher that the House leadership has actually taken away many of his powers as a committee sub-chair so that he doesn't use them to promote his Russian overlords.  He is in it up to his neck and has been for decades.  I suspect that Russian intelligence services have tons of komprat on him and that he is probably a Russian SVR agent.  I've never heard of this Gaetz character but as I said he does look like some alt-reich thug boy."
"Gaetz is Florida, right? Wasn't there some dodgy deal where the case against Trump University was dropped and soon after Trump donated a lot of money? Could it be tied to that?"
"I agree. And TBH the panelists on CNN - who merely bark talking points - is a key reason I switched to MSNBC. There's still panelists from both sides, but more normal people who will engage in genuine debate."

Can you guys critique this one for me before I take it to CNN? \n\nDuring the meeting with the FBI, Devin Nunes and Co were allowed to listen to the bombshell evidence of Trump Jr committing treason on tape. They could not figure out a single way to spin this in a positive light, and rightly assumed that informing the president of his son\'s likely incoming indictment would help in absolute no way. So they said nothing. Trump, watching Fox News 24/7, noticed this and ordered Rudy to state on air that they will only agree to an interview if Trump was allowed to review the information seen in that meeting. Mueller, because he\'s not a sucker, probably either refused to respond or told him something far less important.\n\nTrump, now feeling like people are "getting over on him", starts seething in rage and unleashing a legendary stream of crazy tweets. Melania clearly noticed something was wrong, and brought him his favorite meal: Well-done Filet Mignon with Ketchup with a side of doritos. Trump cut into the steak and saw that, once again, his pathetically worthless wife served him meat that was slightly pink. Tired of her shit, he threw her on the floor and whaled on her kidneys. She was then sent to the Emergency Room, where she quietly filled out divorce papers-- knowing full well that the pre-nup and NDA Michael Cohen had her sign prevented the truth from coming out, and allowing Trump\'s team to make up whatever bullshit story they wanted about what happened. When they did, she silently dropped a hint on her twitter page that she was fleeing the white house and returning to NYC.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

"'Collusion' itself isn't a crime, because it's not really defined, if I understand it correctly.   But accepting material assistance (eg collaborating with a Russian social media program) in the campaign would be a violation of campaign finance law, and doing this as a quid-pro-quo in return for dropping sanctions would be deeply criminal.\n\nAnd covering for Flynn (confessed criminal) by firing Comey (edit: whether or not Trump did anything illegal with Flynn) is likely to constitute obstruction of justice.\n\nAnd the legal process could uncover illegal financing or money laundering in his past, which is also fair game.\n\nAnd as Mueller rolls up the underlings, they're going to have a strong motive to provide evidence against higher ups.

"Well it is a very similar situation with a bizarrely different outcome.  \n\nMueller subpoenas Cohen's files, doesn't think he produced everything that should have been produced so the FBI raids Cohen.

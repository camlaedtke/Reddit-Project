What Happens If Trump Refuses To Be Interviewed By Mueller? -- If the White House does choose defiance and Mueller responds with a subpoena, it would likely set up a high-stakes legal showdown—one in which the special counsel might have the upper hand.
In a closed-door meeting, Trump casually comments it might be good to consolidate power like China and make himself president for life.
White House says Trump will NOT be congratulating Putin on his election win, in part because of recent nerve agent attacks as well as serious irregularities in the Russian election. Trump, on his own, promptly calls Putin to congratulate him on his landslide “victory”.

Trump: “I’m drawing a red line with the Special Counsel investigating my finances.” Robert Mueller and his team: “Fuck your red line.” LMAO
Trump just said he wishes he had picked a different Attorney General. Why? Because he wants an Attorney General who will actively help in his ongoing Obstruction of Justice.
Here's how Trump responded to Mueller's new indictments: "The stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration ... Why didn’t they do something about it ... DNC Server ... Deep State?" Ok, Republican party, this is the line. Do you stand for this?

What did they talk about at dinner? Ivanka? The weather? \n\nThe problem is that Trump's supporters believe all his tweets about fake news, and the media being against him.

'The FBI is conducting the investigation. Mueller is the Special Council.\n\nThe FBI knows everything he knows and they will appoint another Special Counselor.'
'Tl;dr: someone else takes over the investigation, possible protests, possible Democrat political gains, a probable impeachment but probably not for a very long time.\n\nFor the longer version:\n\nBack during the Nixon Investigation there was an event called the "Saturday Night Massacre." Nixon wanted to fire the special prosecutor Archibald Cox, so he gave orders to the attorney general to do so. The attorney general resigned instead, as did the deputy attorney general. Eventually Nixon found a guy in the chain who would do what he asked, the solicitor general.\n\nFollowing that, for the first time polls showed that more Americans supported impeaching Nixon than opposed. Faith in the office of the presidency plummeted, and to this day Nixon is seen as proof of how far a crook can get in American politics. Most mark this as the official beginning of the end of Nixon\'s presidency (he resigned... 9 months later)\n\nThat\'s the historical precedent. Now for the Trump/Mueller situation specifically.\n\nIf Trump fires Mueller, he effectively admits that he is afraid of Mueller\'s findings. Likely a number (maybe not very many, but a few) officials will resign in protest. Further, it won\'t end the investigation, it just means someone else will have to be brought in.\n\nCurrently there are already local protests planned to take place across the country if Mueller is fired. This may cause a social and economic impact to the country, depends on how well Americans can be coordinated to protest and how much political will they have.\n\nRepublicans will have to weigh the costs of standing by Trump. Considering a Trump impeachment that also takes down Pence will allow for a Ryan presidency, the Republicans would have a self-interested motive to support impeachment. In all probability, they would continue to hold out for the results of the investigation. \n\nLong term, confidence in the American government takes a huge hit, both domestically and internationally. Honestly, that ship has already sailed, but this would be like soaking that ship in gasoline and then firing flaming arrows at it.\n\nNixon, in his case, got to stay president for 9 more months. Trump would probably be in a similar situation. The T_D crowd would insist that the God Emperor totally just drained the swamp of a deep state operative like Mueller. The anti-Trump crowd have already reached critical outrage, at this point they can\'t really get much angrier, and its not feasible for them to enter a perpetual state of protest. Whatever centrists still kind of like Trump would probably turn against him, which would do nothing to him but would likely help the Democrats gain seats in congress.\n\nAnd, maybe historically we will see that as the beginning of the end of Trump\'s presidency. But, I think history is going to decide that the beginning of the end was his inauguration.\n'

'To translate the headline into an actual statement: \n\nTwo attorneys think it’s possible to indict trump. Not that it’s imminent or for certain, but that it’s legally possible. \n\nIf you want to get into the jurisprudence on all of this, and get a head start on the arguments that would spawn from such a move by Mueller, the left will be all for it and the right will say that the chief executive, whose role in government is to enforce the law, can’t be indicted. How could you enforce the law if you’re in prison?\n\nSome will agree with the right (looking at you Clarence) and most will not. It’ll go to the Supreme Court to be resolved. \n\nSome will argue under the guise of originalism that impeachment was the only remedy to get rid of a corrupt or criminal public official, while some will argue that the founders never intended for anyone to be above the law, and they’ll cite pre-constitution writings discussing how the revolution took place to get rid of a tyrant who thought he was above the law. \n\nIt will be the most significant Supreme Court case of our lifetimes and god forbid Trump gets to appoint another right wing judicial activist to the court any time soon. If you really want trump to be taken down, you need to hope for a democratic house and senate majority in 2019, or for Ginsburg and Kennedy to remain on the Court'

If you play your cards right, you may even get a bump in your approval. \n\nBut that's if you're innocent and halfway smart, not President Donald J. Trump. "
'I would take anyone ties to the bush administration with a grain of salt. The bush administration destroyed the foundation of our freedom and started our decline as a super power. '

'That\'d have to be handled very delicately. You wouldn\'t want to demand a deadline too early nor have such a demand come directly from the President. If asked, the only thing the President should say is something like "I look forward to the conclusion of the investigation so that we may dedicate our attention entirely to the business of the nation," or direct them to White House counsel.\n\nAfter a month or two, it would be a good idea to have surrogates and party allies hitting those or similar talking points. Political pressure should negatively correlate public interest. As people begin to lose interest, the investigation can begin to be painted as a partisan waste of resources. \n\n'

"PERFECTLY stated.  If you support Trump at this point, you opinion no longer matters, and it won't FOR AWHILE.  I'm old enough to have watched this pattern before - during Watergate."
'I agree, get we pretty much need the following people to vote democrat  in order to win the next two big elections: the people that voted for Hillary, the people who voted for Bernie in the primary and then either voted for Trump or didn’t vote in the general, people who didn’t vote, people who voted for 3rd party candidates, and people recently eligible to vote. The Democratic Party needs to agree on a message that would be able to inspire people to vote. The issue is, the party includes a lot of people with different backgrounds and values, but if we can’t agree we will be in trouble in the midterms '
'doing that becomes so tiring... i\'ve been trying for 2 years, and I constantly get hit with debunked (and ridiculous) conspiracy theories, whataboutisms and flat-out lies.  I can\'t talk to a single Trump supporter without hearing about stupid things like Uranium One and "If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor"... which is not relevant at all.  I have become so pessimistic about them...  They even make excuses for all the guilty pleas and indictments ("oh, he was just a coffee boy"... or "he only worked for Trump for a couple of weeks)....  It\'s going to take an indictment against someone they heard of (Kushner, Trump Jr., etc) to get them to start thinking, "hmmm, well maybe"... in the meantime, they will think everything is a witchhunt because the "snowflake liberals can\'t accept that Trump won and Hillary lost"'

"So Mueller's team passed along a list of possible questions out of respect, and in confidence, and the WH leaked them?"
'It is as if these questions are no longer for the Special Counsel to put to the President of the United States, but for the People of the United States to put to their President.'
"Please don't downvote me into the ground thinking I am defending the man (Hint: I'm not).\n\nIt seems everyone has skimmed over the line:\n\n> The special counsel told Mr. Dowd in March that though the president’s conduct is under scrutiny, he is not a target of the investigation, meaning Mr. Mueller does not expect to charge him.\n\nErr... seems to be a big one, even if this has been stated before."
"Dear Media, \n\nRemember when you covered Trump during primaries because it was good for ratings and it boosted his visibility and subsequent victory? This not only has damaged our country but it's put your own fucking well-benig at risk. Now don't fuck up these investigations for ratings.\n\n<3 Lye"
'Like he would even be truthful '
'I heard the grammatical errors in the list had lead a former assistant of Mueller to believe the questions were made up and perhaps released on Trump\'s behalf to murky up the waters. I feel Trump\'s "Overload the bandwidth of the news cycle" approach to this is working quite effectively, given he is being pounded into the corner of 4 boxing rings at once and somehow has a decent approval rating, but given his tribal base is drinking straight from Trump\'s teet and since it is a single person providing the propaganda it\'s a lot easier for him to take the authoritarian lead while the echo chamber of allies verifies and makes true the propaganda with repetitive buzz word manipulation.'
'Meanwhile in the real world , South Korean President thinks President Trump should receive The Nobel Peace Prize .\n\nMueller,  has accomplished nothing.\nPresident Trump, ending a war.\n\nSee the difference?'

'They probably showed him what they had on him. I would love it if they did.  '
"very curious to see if/how Nunes appears in Mueller's obstruction of justice report."
'Despite the moneyed empowerment the GOP gives Nunes, I would like to think that criminal statutes will overcome this and that he gets prosecuted for obstruction of justice for the way he refused to investigate, manufactured pointless conspiracies and has been the pipeline of information to Trump of otherwise classified information. Surely the rule of law reaches over the politics of deceit and constitutional obstruction. If not, what is left to the once revered concept of good government?'

"He's favored pretty heavily favored out here. I'd be surprised if he got unseated. "
"I know Andrew Janz is running against him, but I'd like to know what the race is looking like too."
"He and a number of House Republicans were likely compromised previous to the Trump candidacy.  The House and Senate Congressional campaign committees have at least $7.35 million in raised and spent money that was distributed to Nunes and others Rs that got laundered through a Russian American.\n\nThere's also post-Trump candidacy contributions that was laundered money through the NRA from Russian oligarchs.  \n\nTo be clear, any money or in-kind contributions (services, material donations) by a foreign agent to a federal, state, or local campaign is illegal.  An example of an in-kind contribution would be the research, set up, and operation of a troll farm for the covert support of a candidate or a third party hacker similar to a WikiLeaks that asks say, Russian intermediaries, to meet with the staff of a favored campaign to let them know they had the goods on their opposition."

Then hope his wife embarrasses him by serving him with divorce papers while still in office.\n\nAm I out to lunch on this?\n'
'Is it just me or does he look like he aged a good 5+ years in the last six months?'
"Trump supporters keep saying the Dossier has been proven false but has ANYTHING in the Dossier been proven false? I understand some things have not been varified 100% but somethings in their have been proven true. I haven't heard of a single thing in  their proven to be false. I am legitimately curious to know."
'Oh my fucking word, please be true'
"Well, we know that Trump can only pardon Cohen for federal crimes. We also know that Mueller has some amount of sway with the State of New York's AG office. I think we can safely assume that Cohen's been up to shady business that probably constitutes some state crimes. So . . . if you're Michael Cohen, you have two choices:\n\n1) Hope notoriously self-centered backstabber Donald Trump swoops in to save you from federal criminal charges. This will not save you from state criminal charges and it will not save you from being subpoenaed by Mueller or Congress to answer for your role in those federal crimes.\n\n2) Throw yourself on the mercy of Robert Mueller and beg for as much immunity as he can possibly give you. This is your best chance to avoid any jail time whatsoever.\n\nThe choice is pretty easy if you ask me."
'Hopefully Cohen is wearing a wire from Mueller when he listens to the offers from Trump. That would be perfect. "Look Cohen, just don\'t say anything to Mueller and I\'ll take care of everything."'
"Just you wait, Trump will pull his 4D chess moves. Maybe he'll be safer locked up when the bombs drop, perhaps it'll guarentee he dosen't do any military service (despite being 72) in any capacity and make him a low priority target.\n\n\nWhen the people of America crawl out the ashes of their once great country they will have no choice but to exonerate him as supreme leader eternal\n\nEDIT: I seriously underestimated the age of the soon to be supreme leader."
"We don't care if Cohen talks, because Trump did nothing wrong, so this investigation should be shut down immediately!  By following long and poorly concealed chains of evidence, Mueller has sprawled way too far beyond his original mandate to investigate evidence!  This man who never talks to the press is only doing this for publicity!\n\nDoublethink is fun"

"Although the photos are difficult to make out, the bald man could potentially be Ahmed Al-Rumaihi. A former Qatari diplomat, who heads up part of a Qatari Investment Authority in the US, and may possibly have connections with the Royal family. This is where things go from downright bizarre to interesting.   \n\n* Last month Ice Cube and a business partner filed litigation against Al-Rumaihi and other defendants, over fallout from investment in their a sports venture. The filing is in Avenatti's hometown of LA.\n* The substance of the case has nothing to do with politics - there are some interesting topics raised in the court filings however.  \n* It's alleged that Al-Rumaihi and the QIA is a front for a PR influence campaign directed on the behalf of the Qatari government. That this specific investment, amongst others known, were for the purposes of raising a more positive image of Qatar in the US.\n* One of the sports league founders (Jeff Kwatinetz) worked with Steve Bannon in a previous career. This is publicly available knowledge according to him. Kwatinetz claims they are still friends, despite having differing political views.\n* Kwatinetz claims that during their deals, Al-Rumaihi *repeatedly* asked him to set up a meeting between Bannon, Al-Rumaihi, the Qatari government. Al-Rumaihi allegedly said that they would underwrite all of Bannon's political efforts in return for his support of Qatar.\n* Kwatinetz stated he rebuffed this, and court filings document the reply as: *'Mr. Al Rumaihi laughed and then stated to me that I shouldn't be naive, that so many Washington politicians take our money, and stated 'do you think Flynn turned down our money?’'*\n* Note that Avenatti made effort to ensure Flynn was pictured here.\n* Note also the extensive allegations of foreign and corporate money ending up in Michael Cohens supposed slush fund.\n* If this is indeed Al-Rumaihi photographed at Trump Tower, that would be months before any of the above occurred. Subsequently, Mike Flynn would be fired. Trump would veer towards the Saudis. The blockade becomes increasingly strenuous for the Qataris. They need a new man on the inside of the Trump White House to be their advocate, someone like Bannon.\n* The coincidences don't stop here.\n* In one particularly tense moment, Kwatinetz claims Al-Rumaihi threatened him, saying 'You don't know who I know in LA and what they're capable of'. \n* In November 2017 the New Yorker broke the story that Harvey Weinstein used private israeli intelligence agency Black Cube to suppress allegations that he had sexually harassed or assaulted numerous women.\n* Last week The Guardian broke the story that people associated with the Trump campaign used 'an Israeli private intelligence agency' to smear Obama officials involved with the Iran nuclear deal. \n* The Qatar Investment Authority owned Miramax films, a company started by Harvey Weinstein and his brother.  \n* In December 2013, Miramax and the Weinstein Company signed a 20-year deal for future cooperation.\n\nPhotos of Ahmed Al-Rumaihi can be found [here](http://tmz.vo.llnwd.net/o28/newsdesk/tmz_documents/2018.04.05%20Final%20Complaint.pdf) in the court filing. Notice the left image on page number 14 in particular - look at what he's wearing."

'It was a stupid argument to begin with. \n\n"He\'s already rich, so why would he care about more money?"\n\nI guess since they\'re same people who believed tax cuts for the rich would trickle down it does make a certain amount of sense for them to believe it...'

"HAHAHA I can't believe that #basta is still a thing..."
"I see several options.\n\n 1. Trump never really paid off Cohen's payments. Giuliano just made that up because it makes Trump look not as much as a cheap asshole. Yes there were payments, just not specifically payback for Stormy Daniels. Because he never did that.\n\n 2. Trump really doesn't have much cash on hand, despite the fact that he paid $400million **in cash** in the last 10 years, for some dodgy real estate deals, like the 2 golf courses in Europe for which he already had to pay $100million extra just to keep them afloat. That seems to imply that Trump really is incapable to properly manage his money. \n\n 3. This slush fund serves just to pay for things that Trump needs to pay for, but which the world should never have found out about, like hush money. Thus: Stormy Daniels  was not an exception, but the rule."
'Not defending these corrupt assholes but if you have lots of money, it’s not in cash. Their net worth is tied up in investments. Having cash = losing money because of inflation. Selling investments to pay off a lump sum would often involve taxes and missed investment gains, so leveraging debt can actually make you more money vs paying a lump sum of cash. A mortgage has a low interest rate, and anyone can make 7% after inflation in the stock market. So if you had a $100k cash and a $100k mortgage at 4% it’s actually better to keep paying the mortgage over time and invest the cash. You’ll offset the cost of your mortgage interest and profit with the rest. '

'It\'s so weird to see anyone focus on whether or not Trump actually has money. It\'s a *very* petty thing to focus on. Really missing the forest for the trees. Here\'s the forest:\n\n#Essential Consultants LLC was probably a bribe fund because the shell company was formed just weeks before the election. \n\nHere\'s what the company ("the company," meaning probably just Michael Cohen and a bank account) was used for afterward:\n\nOh wow, the president is probably going to talk about some shit regarding Net Neutrality. What\'s this? Where\'d this $200,000 from AT&T come from? How generous! Sure, Essential Consultants LLC can give you "insights into understanding the new administration!"\n\nThe president promised to get rid of Obamacare and the GOP is pushing hard to repeal it, regardless of whether or not they have anything to replace it with? It\'s good that pharmaceutical giant Novartis AG came to this "company" with a focus on "US healthcare policy matters." It\'s okay, only the *former* CEO went to the company! Not the *current* CEO!... Oh, and he brought $400,000. \n\nJeez, all this stuff in North Korea has us worried, doesn\'t it? Lots of stuff freaking us out. The president can\'t seem to stop antagonizing Kim Jong Un, either. But it\'s alright. South Korea\'s Aerospace Industries Ltd (KAI) is bidding for a multi billion dollar contract with the US Air Force as we speak. So they\'ll help us out if we do get into any kind of trouble. \n\n...Speaking of which, they have some great help with their accounting. It\'s Essential Consultants LLC!

'Piggybacking on what u/bstump104 said said, think of it like the difference between taking down your neighborhood pot dealer compared to taking down the entire Pablo Escobar operation. There are many moving parts, foreign players, and international laws to contend with. The Mueller case is many layers deep and multifaceted from money laundering and tax evasion to espionage and maybe even human trafficking. Trust me, I’m as antsy as you to see Mueller take down the whole Trump organization and everyone connected to its shady dealings, but good things come to those who wait, and I have complete faith in Mueller to follow the letter of the law so that the charges will stick. Nobody is getting off on a technicality. '
'For anyone who is unfamiliar, here\'s the brief summary of the strategy for the US:\n\n> Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke "Afro-American racists". Russia should "introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics".'

"The New York times article called this, they said the subpoena was likely to get Bannon to agree to a less formal interview, which he now did. If he was being subpoenaed, why did they want him to agree to anything, couldn't he just be dragged to the grand jury testimony?"
'Bannon is like the Christian ethnostate version of Samuel L in Kingsmen\n\n"These racial tensions... are a fever.  Don\'t you agree we need more white blood cells?"'
'*rift\n\nBut if this is true this would be a way more complex degree of planning than any of them have shown themselves capable of'
"Nope but the subpoena was to appear before a grand jury. This way he only has to meet with Mueller and his team and likely have his attorney in the room with him while he's answering questions. It's likely Mueller will have GJ on standby should he refuse to answer or answer in such a way that is less than satisfactory to the investigators."
'Bannon refused to meet with Mueller. Grand jury issues subpoena compelling testimony in front of them. Bannon backs down and agrees to meet with the special counsel. Won’t be in front of GJ but I’m sure that option is still on the table. '
'Careful, the right has convinced people telling the truth it "condescending."'
'I’d just like to point out that he said “People that watch Fox News are on an entirely different planet than people that listen to NPR.” It’s a similar point, but he acknowledged that there are extremes on both sides, which is pretty important, I think.\n\nEdit: Everybody is pointing out that NPR is not extreme, I guess I could have worded that better. And maybe his point was that the propaganda is more heavily influencing the right, I’m not sure. The core of the topic at that point in the show, though, was that there is not a single set of facts that everybody is working from. Every news outlet has a different take, and headlines are so influential nowadays that it has become a problem.'
"The advantage of getting him in a meeting with investigators is they have the ability to use the information a bit more broadly, and use it to lay traps - basically, you have more time to use it (not to mention a cooperative witness is much more appealing than a hostile one). When you drag someone in front of a Grand Jury, you're forcing them to testify on the record. Worse, Bannon can't plead anything but the 5th in front of a GJ - the chance of getting caught in a lie is far higher (and with much higher consequences) in front of a GJ.\n\nOf course, he can still be dragged in front of a GJ and forced to give the same testimony. "

"People need to dispel the JB (James Bond, Jason Bourne, Jack Bauer) ideas about intelligence organizations.  There isn't some Masonic-like initiation wherein one day an individual is a person-of-interest, and the next, they're a fully compromised asset, intentionally betraying their country.  Recruitment of assets is one of the most valuable of crafts in the intelligence world, and the level of effort and patience devoted is often proportional to the potential payoff.\n\nIn the late 80's every westerner visiting the Soviet Union was under close surveillance.  Most hotels had a room that the KGB used to question guests.  A quasi-famous real-estate mogul from NY, that's married a Czech former-model, would most certainly received an approach.  For a man like Turmp, a little flattery probably went a long, long way."

The book has had a large influence within the Russian military, police, and foreign policy elites and it has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Its publication in 1997 was well-received in Russia and powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian fascist and nationalist who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.Dugin credits General Nikolai Klokotov of the Academy of the General Staff as co-author and main inspiration, though Klokotov denies this.

'In many of these transactions, the deal was a "quick-turnaround" all-cash deal which is highly suspicious in places like New York or London. These transactions in many instances were also well above market value (some as much as 300k extra). Being a seller of a property which is being used for money laundering is itself not a crime, but knowing about the crime and actively covering it up using the property is certainly a crime. I\'d recommend reading the article, it has a lot of good info in it. '
"Honest question because I don't know anything about money laundering -- but isn't that just chump change in the grand scheme of things? We're talking not over a couple million for one of these units, how much money can you realistically launder in these scenarios?"
'Lol. Yes. (Real lol) Oh Lordy I Hope There Are Tapes!'
"I am also certainly very ignorant of all this as well, but these all are adding up (of which, are just what we know of because they have already been directly or indirectly incriminated in these court riceedings, let alone all of those we don't yet know about) to at least fairly substantial amounts. My, again, completely ignorant guess is that Trump then could, in turn, make purchases with his now apparently legit money in ways which are either yet unknown because he won't disclose his tax records, and because they could likely be transacted overseas through Lord knows how many Ruskie shell companies on foreign jurisdictions, returning the money to the Russians in exchange for, well, all of this horseshit thus far. Not to mention that Russians could have interests in the outcome of Trump’s many dismantling of laws which benefit large American companies which hope to benefit from the now captured entities making up American regulatory bodies. The Russians could be leveraging these law changes and monopolistic mergers being allowed to happen in the stock exchanges. \n\nIn short, Russia pays Trump dirty money to then either male apparently legit purchases in Russia in exchange for favors by Russia. Or, Russia benefits from backroom deals done with bought politicians and mega corporations which inflated stocks which benefits Russian spenders, in exchange for favors to Trump. Or all of this is continually done on the basis of blackmail for things Russia has on Trump. And/or because Trump is, too, laundering money the other way around in Russia in some sort of fucked up Ponzi scheme of corruption/blackmail/laundering going in continual circles. \n\nIn, even shorter, I still actually don’t have any idea but this much business with this many powerful people from a country which is already implicated in election tampering by a foreign country is shady as all fuckout and I don’t like it one bit but I have faith that our savior, the Mueller will collate it all eventually and I’lll live to see the first federally imprisoned ex-president and the first unilaterally reversed legislative record after the fact. By the way, I used to be a republican, this excuse for a president is literally turning party voters on their ear. "
'I\'m sorry, I wasn\'t clear when I brought up the amount of money laundered. I wasn\'t trying to say "Oh well it\'s just a few mill here and there, big deal." I\'m wondering if it\'s realistic to assume that he made all or most of his money from laundering with those transactions being only a couple million per transaction. I have no idea how someone gets the money clean, but I assumed if you were laundering money you would want to make it worth your time, and I also assumed that the bigger the transaction, the more money you can launder through said transaction without raising red flags. But I don\'t know the slightest thing about finance or money laundering so I\'m just speculating based off what I\'ve seen from movies and TV shows.'

'This is not a tipping point. Trump is still popular with GOP voters. The true tipping point is when his GOP support drops below 50%'
"41% want him impeached and they say he has a 39% approval rating. \n\nAtm his most recent approval is 45% \n\nhttps://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx\n\nOther news sources say that it's actually 42% that want him impeached not 41%\n\nhttps://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/2018/6/22/17492450/poll-trump-impeachment-nixon-watergate\n\nSo I'm confused what the real polling is or if the polling is bias."

"Good luck with your moral thoughts. Trump isn't going anywhere. There is way too much money to be made for his team."
'Yeah, but what does this mean in the context of the political party seeming to fracture? \n\nIt seems like 80% of 80% of who supported you last year (or before the primaries) can be an easily manipulated statistic, depending on your stance in the argument. Either it’s “80% among Republicans” or “64% among last election cycles republicans”. \n\nSeems very close to the tea party movement days. '
"Now that would be the day. All the Republicans who dislike him join the Democrats or start a new political party. It's a shame that wouldn't happen to be honest. The ensuing shitstorm would be rather hilarious to watch as the far-right voters realise they've just made a big jump to the left possible by electing Trump."
'Looks like Republican party affiliation has been dropping since Trump won. '
'Actually, its much less than you realize. A lot of seemingly solid Red States have a large amount of independent voters. \n\nFor the first time, Arizona, the home of "Goldwater" republicanism has been usurped by Independent voter who hold about 34% of the registered voters with Republicans at 32% and Democrats at 31% with "others" the remaining 3%. This was related several months ago and the Independents percentage is probably higher now. It was the conservative independents who voted for the McCains, Flakes and other Republicans now in office. \n\nIt is these same independents in many key states, not GOP or Dems who will actually make the decisions on who gets elected. Arizona voters were happy and liked both McCain and Flake, but there (were) are loud and persistent right wingers in the Phoenix Valley that supported Sheriff Joe, but even the republicans and Indpendents turned and voted him out of office. A few years ago, there were more Dems in the House from AZ, than republicans, but an onslaught of grey money flipped the seats. Reports/polls show they may flip back. But one thing is certain;\n\nThey are not happy with Trump.'
"Actually, the Dems held both houses in Congress, but they held something much more important. Because Spiro Agnew had resigned the VP slot, if Nixon would have been impeached and the VP slot not filled, a DEMOCRAT, the House Speaker Carl Albert, would have been appointed President (3rd in line)\n The Dems, controlling the Senate, would not confirm Nixon's or the GOP's pick of Nelson Rockefeller for VP. It was not until Nixon and the GOP gave in and suggested  Gerald Ford as a pick, would the Dems approve and a bargain was made. Within weeks of Gerald Ford being sworn in as VP, Nixon kept his part of the bargain and resigned. When it seemed that the Independent Persecutor would indict Nixon, after he left office. Gerald Ford Pardoned him.\n\nNote: the Pardon by Ford was hugely unpopular and it was a bipartisan feeling, as Ford lost the next election 20 months later to Jimmy Carter."

"Deputy AG Rosenstein wouldn't allow Mueller's investigation to continue if there wasn't anything further the investigation could yield. The fact that those on the inside expect the case to last *at least* another year is presumably because there is a lot of evidence to go through. From my reading, the investigation is legally bound to follow through on all other criminal leads it falls upon. I'm no expert, but I suspect these types of cases at this high of a level tend to yield many other channels of wrongdoing that take time to investigate.\n\nTL;DR -- If anything, hearing that the investigation will take *at least* another year is good news for those hopeful that justice will prevail.

(Unsurprisingly, Clinton voters who supported McCain were more likely to have negative views of African Americans, relative to those who supported Obama.)\n\n\n>**Thus, the 6 percent or 12 percent of Sanders supporters who may have supported Trump does not look especially large in comparison with these other examples.**   [(Via WaPo, 2017)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/08/24/did-enough-bernie-sanders-supporters-vote-for-trump-to-cost-clinton-the-election/?utm_term=.f77de778e5cf)\n\n\n"

"Three months ago, on the day Giuliani was hired, I predicted he would be [Trump's TV surrogate and that T_D would turn on Cohen](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/comments/8dimn3/giuliani_just_joined_trumps_legal_team_responding/dxnz8yh/) by calling him a traitor and a rat.\n\nThe first part of that prediction came true almost immediately, it's taken longer for the second part to come true. But that day has arrived."
'It occurred to me that if true, and if he knew and approved of that meeting and it\'s intended goal, then yes, there is now an answer to the stupid trumpeter question "Was there proof of **trump** colluding?"\n\nand the answer is: \'**YES**\'\n\nIs there enough to convict?  probably not, but there is now evidence in the form of first hand testimony.  so sad.'
"If I wanted to obstruct justice, I might pretend to alienate a close colleague, instruct him to tell an unprovable lie that my enemies want to believe, and have him later unsettle the entire case against me by recanting, all while keeping the power to pardon said colleague in my pocket.\n\nThe idea colleague?  One who's promised to take a bullet for me.\n\nJust saying... This sounds too good to be true."
"honestly I do have hope that something will happen and trump will go down, but after all of the shit that's already happened I'm suspicious that nothing will"
"Trump is so smart he treated the guy with all his skeletons like a turd exactly when he was under immense pressure by the law, and so rich he didn't even want to help him out with his legal fees. ~~Colbert~~  ~~John oliver~~  Mueller is right, this *is* stupid watergate."
'I love the smell of federal statutory code in the morning. '
"I made these points a while ago, but without your careful elucidation of the relevant statutes. Kudo's!!\n\nBut what I would also like to point out that, while Giuliani made a big deal about Cohen's truthfulness and credibility as a witness, there is a better chance that Mueller will only need Cohen as corroboration. I do believe that Mueller has had information of Donald Sr's knowledge of Russian involvement including the Trump tower meeting long ago. Lets not forget that in that meeting in the Trump Tower between the Trump people and the Russians were a translator who does work for the US State Department and know every word that was said, but more importantly people who have left the Trump administration an are not covered by Executive privilege have been questioned by Mueller, including Hope Hicks. While Mueller knows that Manafort may hold several keys to the Trump campaigns involvement with Russia, what he knows is also shared with other people that Mueller has interviewed long ago.\n\nRight now Mueller is seeking to just corroborate information he already knows. The fact that Mueller of DOJ atty's have not even questioned Cohen and that Cohen has volunteered this information, is informative, it may well be that Mueller does not need Cohens testimony and a linchpin for his case. Cohen though, may hold the keys for several other misdeeds of the Trump campaign outside of Russia, that may be of interest to the DOJ. He can serve to corroborate what Mueller knows though.\n\nNeedless to say, your outline of Trumps legal problems, is just starting to resonate among legal pundits, now its just the witnesses and probative evidence the Mueller already has, to start another indictment process."
'Is Trump being accused of breaking 52 USC 30121, for receiving information from the Russians, in which the information would constitute something of value, defined as:\n\n> It shall be unlawful for a person to solicit, accept, or receive a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value, or to make an express or implied promise to make a contribution or donation, in connection with a Federal, State, or local election\n\n?'

'Ronny Jackson likely also falsified some evidence. Trump’s BMI being just under overweight and his calcium score being indicative of cardiac disease yet totally disregarded in the original report lends me to believe he was covering for the president. \n\nIn light of recent knowledge of Dr. Jackson had multiple allegations of inappropriate requests of his PA’s to order opioids, this addiction may have been leveraged against him to risk potentially losing his medical license and people’s trust in him in order to comply with the demands of the current president.\n\nRonny resigned without resistance. This is likely because these allegations are true with Trump tweeting they aren’t in order to sway the opinion of his major supporters. \n\nIn a few months or so an investigation will be done revealing this. Just one more issue to add to the mess... Hopefully a trustworthy physician can do a mini-mental examination or other marker of cognitive function because Ronny Jackson’s evaluation was likely compromised by the above.'

'And everyone has known this for many months now. The Trump campaign colluding with the Russian government is not a topic of debate, it is fact. That they MAY have received nothing at the meeting is also immaterial. The intent was there. But the Republicans have already proven that facts and evidence mean nothing. Total fealty and undying loyalty to their Lord and Savior Trump is all they care about. There will not be justice without voting all of them out, all of them, or a violent revolution.\n\nEdit: redhats love to play word games with the word “collusion”. Forget collusion. As someone mentioned below, they attempted to conspire against the United States. They met with representatives of the Russian government in order to gain compromising materials, or so they thought, against an electoral opponent. That’s illegal. You can’t do that. That is not the same thing as receiving intelligence from a UK intelligence asset who is an expert on Russia. Don’t let those idiots twist it. They are not the same thing.'

"If there were any truth to that, we'd hopefully see her being investigated similarly, if she were the president. But she's not. So fucking give it up already."

I kept insisting to him that I’m not to the far left but I was registered Independent and have some conservative views and some liberal, what I like to amount to a overall common sense strong moral view.  One day I finally asked him what he thought of the Paul Manafort situation.  He didn’t even know who Paul Manafort was.  I was speechless.  '

'What counts as "Trump Russia collusion?"  Does Trump have to personally be writing e-mails or something?

'Yes, good observation!Keep Focused!! Don\'t underestimate the harm he can do to Trump. He is probably the only one that we know about, that can testify in open court, about "high crimes and misdemeanors" he has committed and those that had participation or foreknowledge by Donald Trump or a witness to comments made by the now siting President. Remember, Trump is legally liable for crimes he committed while not President, even those whose statutes of limitations have run out, if these crimes were purposely and deliberately hidden.Cohen was also a leg man for Trump, meeting people outside the campaign purview, but begs the question is "What did he do?" There is anecdotal evidence he may have been a connection to Russian intelligence or the Russian hackers, if not, then other people that even the Trump campaign felt were too toxic for anyone "in" the campaign to meet with.\n\nI think Cohen feels he has information that is important enough to keep him out of jail, (for his family, of course )and has seen Mueller\'s handling of an unrepentant and uncooperative Manafort.'
"Nothing can harm Trump anymore.   He's safe from any prosecution thanks to McConnell and the Supreme Court."
'His rich friends will ostracize him if he flips on Trump. No one will trust him or employ him as a lawyer ever again.'

'All due respect to the commenters above, but are you kidding? tRump has skirted the New York legal system for decades. He was widely understood to be one of the crookedest public figures in recent memory, but due to bribes and backdoor favors, escaped relatively unscathed. Money (and power) talks, *especially* in New York. Just because he now has the public eye we’re supposed to think he’ll get caught in the net? I dearly hope you’re right, but the realist in me is betting otherwise. '
'Their point is that a lot of his business is likely coming from guys that don’t understand how attorney-client privilege works. So him not being a lawyer will interfere with that. Even though *we* know that privilege doesn’t work that way, that doesn’t mean that he hasn’t been presenting it that way to others (like Trump, obviously, who *did* think everything he did with Cohen was covered under ACP).

'Trump is authoritarian, and he wants to be a dictator. He said the North Korean state media is better than Fox New because it is "nicer" to their dear leader. He said the people of North Korea "love" their leader, and he wants the American people to feel the same way about him. He joked about being president forever, just like Xi in China. He says it\'s okay if Russia kills journalists, and he has joked about throwing reporters into prison.'
"I've been thinking since Trump meeting with Kim that this whole situation feels like the aligning of forces for ww3. The whole Trump verse Kim of the past few months was a show.... Trump is too stupid and is definitely Putin's pawn. Now Trump, Kim and Xi all meeting in Russia with Putin... The tariffs with China are a show too. Soon Trump will start pulling US trips out of the South China Sea, begin drawing down troops in South Korea and find away to back out of NATO. When the Muller investigation (s) begin showing their teeth at Trump, and it becomes clear Trump will be locked up, that's when sht will go down. Hopefully Trump doesn't have enough of the US armed forces on his side when that time comes. Hopefully he hasn't already compromised enough of US intelligence to completely weaken US Armed forces."

'American news reporters with sick mind twisting translation + circle jerkers 1.0.\n\n"putin did you want trump to win the election and did you direct bla bla"\n\n"yes i wanted him to win because relations blabla" (why the fuck did you translate "yes i did", he said yes i wanted him to win, well i know why but think for yourselves)\n\nle idiots: OMG PUTIN ELECTED TRUMP!! le keyboard riot!!!!\n\nthe fuck was he supposed to reply you clowns, no, actually i supported hillary which was actively calling for escalation between our countries?!'
'The interpretor made an poor translation.  I hear Putin saying " Да, я хотел, чтобы он выиграл ( Da, ya khotel, chtoby on vyigral  )".  Word for word this translates as "Yes, I wanted that he won...".  It is clearly an indication of his support, but "Yes, Yes I did want him to win" as a confirmation of both questions is not the correct translation.  All the same, there is no denial on Putin\'s part.'

'> “Yes I did, yes I did”, implying Putin is answering yes to both\n\n Repeating the same thing twice doesn\'t really imply he\'s answering both questions one after another... \n\n The translator is clearly repeating the "Da" because he jumped the gun the 1st time, as Putin wasn\'t done with the sentence after "Da", and he was trying to make it clear Putin was saying that all as one sentence, to avoid making it seems that he just said "Yes!".\n\n > He ignored the latter part of the question.\n\n Somehow i doubt not denying it wasn\'t intentional... \n\n It\'s like when he always smirks when he says he\'s not poisoning/killing his opponents... \n\n '

'Schiff is the anti-Trump.  He’s a brilliant guy (Stanford undergrad, Harvard Law), who has chosen to work in public service as a federal prosecutor.  He is in his 6th term in the House, so he understands the nuances of how the government works.  Anyone who has seen Schiff in interviews knows that he’s a cautious person who is even-tempered, and he chooses his words carefully because he understands the impact of his voice.  He is articulate and humble, and he leads not with bluster or threats, but rather with the power of his ideas.  \n\nIf he ever decides to run for President, I will gladly do whatever I can in my state to get him elected.  He would be the best person for the office in a post-Trump America.'
"I will welcome the day when a real conservative party arise in America. As far as i concerned, GOP's not real conservatism anymore. It's a bonker regressive party now."
'Just like how the left has pushed false and half truths to push their agenda for the last few decades. Sweet irony. '
"I respect why you feel the way you do, but the whole idea of being conservative is itself bonkers. We need to be constantly updating, improving, changing, getting better - the world is change, we are change, God is change. The very notion of conservative is flawed, and we are witnessing what backwardsness the fear and stagnancy of conservatism can breed. Jesus and America were o.g. liberal progressives. No more time for what doesn't work."
"Schiff has had pretty strong words for a while now, although he's always very measured."
'Nope. We love that obama got bin Laden without starting a war with Pakistan. \n\nRemember when Fox News was bitching about how Obama would pronounce Pakistan correctly? That’s probably why Republicans started a war with every country that wasn’t harboring bin Laden. '
"The good idea behind conservatism isn't to not change. It's to have gradual change rather than abrupt one. Very quick change without discussion will make some people scared at best and make your plans backfired at worst, like for example if you raise taxes immediately to get more money from the ultra rich without real planning, they may run away to another state or country instead. To make the best way to raise taxes for these rich is to hear from them or at least the saner riches, make some compromises, and make plans in case your plan will have some negative initial consequences regardless of their agreement.\n\nYou need many sides to make healthy counter arguments for your policies and discuss some middle roads, or else you'll scare the other side and make stuff cannot be negotiated. Hell, even if your idea's unarguably the good one, having someone from other side will help you to point out the flaws behind your idea (which's why there are pesky editors for creative works in the first place). The problem with Republican is that the huge chunk of them cannot be reasoned with  because all they care about is winning. Even people like me who think democrats being center-right is a bad generalization agreed that republicans are downright batshit insane."
'> The very notion of conservative is flawed\n\nTheoretically, conservatism should be about values -- you know real values  you cherish and strive for in yourself and in society as a whole, not a cheap excuse for greed and hate.\n\nLike Mr. Rogers.\n\n'
'As long as you have people who fear losing what they have earned, or what they were born into, you will have conservatives.\n\nAnd much as you might dislike it, there’s value in conservative thinking. It balances out the optimism and naïveté of liberalism.\n\nIt’s the difference between an 18 year old and a 80 year old. Both have their flaws, both have something to offer. The smart move is to listen to both and find the best middle ground.\n\nThat part about listening is the real key to it.'
'If the FBI was investigating something, then they had probable cause.  I trust law enforcement agencies in the United States.  \n\nThere is a multitude of prima facie evidence to suggest that Trump’s team was engaged in questionable conduct throughout the campaign - do you disagree?  '
'Obama didn’t invade Libya. The EU did and the US played a supporting part. That’s why we aren’t stuck in Libya right now. So, yes I give Obama a lot of credit for getting that right. '
"No, that view is just very reductive. Value conservatism postulating a set of values as guiding principle makes no statement about other philosophies. Liberalism focuses on liberty. Social-democracy on social equality and participation. That doesn't mean that value conservatives can't value liberty or equality or social-democrats have no values."

Trump still wont be impeached.   Bc thats not how the constitution works.  '
'He’s not exactly showing it. \nHe basically came out and said that these Russians he found were meddling. Nothing really on Trump himself. In fact they were doing not my president rallies as soon as he was elected and have been trying to get democrats elected for midterms.\n\n\nSo... yeah.

'*Disasterpiece\n\n\nIt should never have come to this; the fact that all of this is coming out and STILL people will support Trump as the shining example of a true American is just sad.  In a short time, he has done so much damage, not just to our image internationally, but to the integrity of our political and justice systems at home. '
"On one hand, Mueller publishes his findings before the mid-terms. The republicans do nothing, and when the midterms happen everyone sees the party for what it is and it collapses. Alternately they do get off their rich, fat asses and do something and they maintain some veneer of integrity. \n\nOn the other hand, Mueller sits on what he has until after the mid-terms for a guaranteed immediate reaction. However, the backlash the Republican party so richly deserves won't be as severe in this case.\n\nIn either case, it's a win to some degree. Now we just need to sue Fox News into bankruptcy, and sanity will be restored."
'I\'ve noticed over the last year that your type of argument has evolved a bit:\n\n"There is no evidence Trump has anything to do with Russia"\n[proof of Trump being involved with Russia is provided]\n\n"There is no evidence anyone in Trump\'s campaign had any meetings with Russian officials"\n[proof of Trump\'s people having meetings with Russian officials]\n\n"There is no evidence anyone in Trump\'s campaign had any illegal meetings with Russian officials"\n[proof of Trump\'s people having illegal meetings with Russian officials]\n\n"There is no proof anyone in Trump\'s family were involved with these illegal meetings with Russian officials"\n[proof members of Trump\'s family have been involved with illegal meetings with Russian officials]\n\n"Russia did not meddle in the 2016 election"\n[Trump and Putin both admit it happened, along with literally all of our intelligence services/agencies]\n\nAll you\'re left with now is "Ok fine, all of those other things were true, but you can\'t prove Trump was in on it!"\n\nWhich of course, the odds of Trump not being in on it are rapidly approaching 0.0% every day.\n\nI hope whatever Rubles or Camel Cash or whatever you get for trolling is worth it.

"A few questions  \n\n>They accounted for 21% of the 6,400 Trump condos sold in the US. Those figures include condos that Trump developed as well as condos that others developed in his name under licensing deals that pay Trump a fee or a percentage of sales.\n\nCouldn't this be just a show of how Russia or perhaps other shady figures have their fingers in everything, without directly targeting trump? His company might just gave an international reputation for being able to be abused for thus sort of thing and he's a complacent idiot taking his cut. \n\n Also the article mentions that the companies being based in Delaware is potentially suspicious for 'transparency'. IANAL,  but Delaware is extremely popular to almost any company because of low corporate tax and business laws that are extremely efficient and beneficial to the companies or something like that.

"True, and I get that. I'm not saying this because I think of myself as an important person to convince. I'm saying more in the vein of public opinion and continues support for the investigation. Public pressure could in theory convince 'real' (moderate? I dont know the rules anymore) republican reps to not cave and spew neocon rhetoric on trumps behalf to ensure their seats. It could keep general media from being so partisan that every story is a 'breaking news' on the investigation that isn't actually news and just takes air time and discussion time away from other issues. \n\nI personally think the parts I pointed out before don't necessarily lend credibility to the article that could help generate that support or sway the opinions of moderates, who I believe are the real people we need to be catering this news too.

"What might be the motivation behind this? Some theories are being offered..:\n\n- An attempt to gather favor with Republicans and the Trump base in general?\n- Some unknown quid-pro-quo where Trump is doing this to gain someone's help?\n- Driven by spite against Comey (who was FBI director when this incident happened)?\n- Just Trump's usual erratic behavior?\n- Some combination of the above?"
'This is such sleazy messaging to scum like Cohen, Kushner, Donny Jr. , little Eric and all the other known, and as yet unknown, liars who carried the can for Trump.  All Trump toadies and criminals will be pardoned he collaterally declares. Everyday there is a new convulsion in the body politic. Democracy has to expel the bile and toxins to be well again. Scooter Libby is emblematic of the bile, and secondarily is consistent with Bolton getting his way to boot. Libby was the kind of neo-con slug that Bolton sees as a loyal soldier to his cause and instincts. Mueller and his team will not lose their nerve and despite the abuse of Executive power Trump and his kind will be humbled and brought to justice. Finding the pee-pee video, isn’t essential, or for that matter important, it’s just the metaphor to put the period at the end of the sentence: Here is the end of the Trump presidency. '
'But is Libby still important enough and connected to the GOP establishment where they would owe him a favor. If Trump wanted support in the firing of Mueller or Rosenstein, I imagine the GOP would exact something far more valuable to them than the pardoning of a disgraced aide no one has really thought about for years. '
'This article made some good suggestions as to why, I believe.\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2018/04/13/politics/trump-scooter-libby-pardon/index.html\n\nPersonally, I think railing against the decisions of a special council in general (and *specifically* one appointed by Comey) makes the most sense, as does the connection between diGenova and Toensing with Libby, who have apparently still been talking with Trump despite declining to represent him.\n\nTake "revenge" on an enemy while doing a favor for a couple supporters? Seems to check out.'
"Great point - hadn't thought of that."
'Its such a terrible way to approach politics. To treat it like a team sport to which you choose a team and owe that team unwavering support regardless of that team constantly doing things that go directly against your self interest. Nobody owes any politicians or political party that type of loyalty. You owe them loyalty only while they are living up to what you feel is bettering your life and country. This blind faith and cult like support is pathetic and has much more to do with a personality cult and a sad need to feel like you "win" something than it does political policy that they agree with.'

'just what i’ve gathered from following this saga, but i looked it up\n\n>[In the United States, the pardon power for federal crimes is granted to the President of the United States under Article II, Section 2 of the United States Constitution which states that the President "shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment". The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted this language to include the power to grant pardons, conditional pardons, commutations of sentence, conditional commutations of sentence, remissions of fines and forfeitures, respites, and amnesties. The pardon can also be used for a presumptive case, such as when President Gerald Ford pardoned Nixon over any possible crimes regarding the Watergate scandal. There is a strong consensus among legal experts that a president cannot pardon someone for state crimes. Experts disagree as to whether a president can pardon himself.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_pardons_in_the_United_States) '

'How can we tell what the support actually is, if like you say, dissent is crushed promptly? That certainly has a chilling effect on the true numbers of satisfaction with their government. I prefer to err on the side of good intent until proven otherwise. \n\nWith that said, people do tend to be motivated by perceived national embarrassment, and support politicians who call it out and who promise reprisal. Mao sought to rectify Chinese historical embarrassments, as did the nazis, and most recently Trumpism. So the point that Russians distain Americans is valid, but I’m more inclined to think the support for America in Russia is undersold for various motives.'

'To me, the much more damning line was his initial response when Comey told him there was intelligence that he was recorded with prostitutes peeing on the bed.  His response to that was:\n\n"There were no prostitutes; there were never prostitutes"\n\nTo me, that sure sounds like a non-denial of most of the important points of the story, and a focus on if the women doing the peeing in the video were technically prostitutes.  e.g. if Trump wasn\'t the one paying them, he can claim they weren\'t prostitutes.\n'

It made *a lot* of sense to me.  I think in 20-30 years this transition will be complete.  What that means for the current left-right parties? Hard to say, especially in the US, but some fracturing might take place, especially on the right.  I could see the Democrats transitioning from center/center-left to open, but it's harder to see the GOP transitioning fully to a closed model.  Many of the large backers of the GOP need globalization in order to maintain their positions.  I think it's more likely that the GOP will split into a closed party and an open party which is more conservative on social issues."

'Trump is taking the right approach. Unless you actually want to start arresting  Russian intelligence officers or overthrowing Putin, all one could do as a "normal" politician is huff and puff and stomp your feet. \n\nMeddling in elections is a time-honored tradition among superpowers (or former superpowers). The United States holds the record for most elections meddled in at 81. Russia (or the former Soviet Union) is second at 36. In 1964 both the Soviets and the United States meddled in the Chilean election. The CIA spent $2.4 million in secret to make sure the socialist did not win. With no surprise the Christian Democrat won. \n\nI felt that Facebook ads and hacked servers that should have been more secure would be a footnote in history. Instead, it\'s being used against a man who campaigned on and never made secret his desire to normalize relations with Russia to tackle bigger issues. He knows how other presidents have approached Russia and it has gotten us nowhere. He has seen how Europe is being slowly invaded and is buckling under its various welfare states and damn near Orwelian speech laws and won\'t be much stronger in the future. No loss there.\n\nIt really baffles me how anyone could be against Russia and America even just talking. Even if nothing happens, that\'s about as much as we could expect from any other administration when it comes to Russia and North Korea. \n\nI just have no strong feelings on it. I\'m cynical about all of it.  That\'s enough to get you exiled these days. \n\nI think a lot of it is jealousy from the establishment and their sympathisers. They should have been the ones dealing with the Russia problem, and all the other problems in the world, not the worse candidate in history who beat the best candidate in history. '

'**#TRE45ON**\n\nBelow I will summarize primary sources from the Justice Department, Senate Intelligence Committee, and the Department of Homeland Security. I will quote directly from primary sources. Today President Trump once again undermined American democracy and its institutions, instead he defended Putin\'s egregious attacks in front of the entire world.\n\n**July 3, 2018 the Senate Intelligence Committee, led by Republican Senator Richard Burr, concluded that Russia interfered with the American election and specifically helped Donald J. Trump.^[[1]](https://www.burr.senate.gov/download/final-ssci-ica-assessment)**\n\n*Pg. 4*\n\n>We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in  2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia\'s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\n\n**July 13, 2018 Special Counsel Mueller\'s indictment of 12 Russian Intelligence Officers.**\n\nLast week the Justice Department indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers linked to Guccifer 2.0 and their role in hacking Clinton and the DNC.^[[2]](https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download) The Russians had access to information on 500,000 voters, officially vote tallies were not changed however they targeted voter registration rolls.^[[3]](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/13/5-key-takeaways-from-mueller-indictment-of-russian-election-hackers.html)\n\n>The Russians allegedly hacked America\'s election infrastructure, including state election boards and secretaries of state. The allegations in Friday\'s indictment went well beyond merely hacking the Clinton campaign and Democratic campaign committees. From one state election board, the Russians managed to steal information on 500,000 voters, Rosenstein said, although he did not identify which state. Trump won the 2016 election by winning three key states by slim margins that added up to around 80,000 votes.\n\n>...An American congressional candidate allegedly asked for, and received, stolen documents about his or her opponent from the Russians. \n\n>...A journalist allegedly discussed with the Russian front account, Guccifer 2.0, about when to release stolen documents related to Black Lives Matter. \n\n>...Russian hackers targeted Clinton emails the same day Trump called for them to find "missing" emails.\n\n**July 27, 2016, remember the date. Candidate Trump publicly asked Russia for their help to hack Hillary Clinton, Russia obliged.**\n\nDuring a campaign rally in Florida on July 27, 2016, President Trump called on Russia to help him find Hillary Clinton\'s missing 30,000 emails.^[[4]](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html) Special Counsel Mueller\'s new indictment against 12 Russian Intelligence Officers found that on July 27, 2016 Russian hackers known as Guccifer 2.0 hacked Hillary Clinton\'s emails.\n\n*DoJ Indictment of 12 Russian Intelligence Officers Pg. 7 - 8*\n\n>The Conspirators spearphished individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign throughout the summer of 2016. For example, on or about July 27, 2016, the Conspirators attempted after hours to spearphish for the first time email accounts at a domain hosted by a thirdparty provider and used by Clinton’s personal office. At or around the same time, they also targeted seventy-six email addresses at the domain for the Clinton Campaign. \n\n**June 9, 2016 - A month before candidate Trump publicly asked for help from a foreign adversary, his surrogates met with Russian operatives at the now infamous Trump Tower meeting.**\n\nOne of the Russian operatives present at the infamous Trump Tower meeting, Rinat Akhmetshin, has ties to Russian intelligence and has a history of being embroiled in  court cases related to hacking campaigns. He also has ties to Paul Manafort.^[[5]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/21/us/rinat-akhmetshin-russia-trump-meeting.html?referer=)\n\n>He has an association with a former deputy head of a Russian spy service, the F.S.B., and a history of working for close allies of President Vladimir V. Putin. Twice, he has worked on legal battles for Russian tycoons whose opponents suffered sophisticated hacking attacks, arousing allegations of computer espionage.\n\n>Few episodes from Mr. Akhmetshin’s past seem more relevant to Mr. Mueller’s investigation than his work for two Russian billionaires accused of infiltrating their adversaries’ computers during nasty legal battles.\n\n>The Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 took place less than a week before revelations that hackers had penetrated the Democratic National Committee’s computers and obtained a trove of emails. Investigators have traced digital espionage to Russian spy agencies. \n\n>During the same period that Mr. Akhmetshin was accused of being involved in various hacking schemes, he appears to have been nurturing a relationship with Viktor Ivanov, once the deputy head of Russia’s intelligence service, the F.S.B., and until last year a top aide to Mr. Putin.\n\n\n>Mr. Akhmetshin told journalists that he was a longtime acquaintance of Paul J. Manafort, who served as a high-paid consultant to Mr. Yanukovych for years before becoming chairman of the Trump campaign.\n\n**August 22, 2017 Senate Intelligence Committee Testimony that the Trump campaign accepted regular intelligence from the Kremlin**\n\nThe Senate Judiciary committee testimony of Fusion GPS CEO Glenn Simpson was released unilaterally by Senator Feinstein because Republicans refused. Simpson confirms that the Trump campaign likely received foreign intelligence aid during the 2016 campaign as Manafort had close ties to Russian Intelligence.^[[6]](https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/3/9/3974a291-ddbe-4525-9ed1-22bab43c05ae/934A3562824CACA7BB4D915E97709D2F.simpson-transcript-redacted.pdf)\n\n*Pg. 154 - 155 Senate Judiciary Committee Testimony*\n\n>A. I mean, one of the key lines here in the second paragraph says "However, he and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his democratic and other political rivals." So the issue with the Trump Tower meeting, as 1 I understand it, is that the Trump people were eager to accept intelligence from a foreign government about their political rivals and that is, you know, I would say, a form of interference. If you\'re getting help from a foreign government and your help is intelligence, then the foreign government\'s interfering. I mean, you know, I think that also -- of course, in retrospect we now know this was pretty right on target in terms on what it says. So anyway --\n\n>Q. In reference to you think that particular sentence?\n\n>A. I mean, it clearly refers to, you know, them being interested in and willing to -- it depicts them as accepting information. What we have seen to date with the disclosures this year is they were at a minimum super interested in getting information.\n\n>Q. And when you\'re referencing the "disclosures this year," could you just be specific about that.\n\n>A. The Trump Tower meeting.\n\n>Q. So with reference to the June 9th Trump Tower meeting?\n\n>A. Yes. Yes.\n\n**July 13, 2018 Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats warns of devastating cyber threats to U.S. infrastructure.**\n\nThe President of the United States does not care to protect Americans from ongoing Russian aggression.

Starting at least in or around 2014, Defendants and their co-conspirators began to track and study groups on US social media sites dedicated to US politics and social issues. In order to gauge the performance of various groups on social media sites, the ORGANIZATION tracked certain metrics like the group\'s size, the frequency of content places by the group, and the level of audience engagement with that content, such as the average number of comments or responses to  a post. \n\n\n\n>a. KRYLOVA and BOGACHEVA, together with other defendants and co-conspirators, planned travel itineraries, purchases equipment (such as cameras, SIM cards, and drop phones), and discussed security measures (including "evacuation scenarios") for Defendants who traveled to the United States. \n\n\n>**Use of US Social Media Platforms**\n\n>32.. Defendants and their co-conspirators, through fraud and deceit, created hundres of social media accounts and used them to develop certain fictitious US personas into "leader[s] of public opinion" in the United States. \n\n>**Use of US Computer Infrastructure**\n\n>39.. To hide their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation, Defendants and their co-conspirators - particularly POLOZOV and the ORGANIZATION\'s IT department - purchases space on computer servers located inside the United States in order to set up virtual private networks ("VPNs"). Defendants and their co-conspirators connected from Russia to the US based infrastructure by way of these VPNs and conducted activity inside the United Sates - including accessing online social media accounts, opening new accounts, and communicated with real US persons - while masking the Russian origin and control of the activity. \n\n>40.. Defendants and their co-conspirators also registered and controlled hundreds of web-based email accounts hosted by US email providers under false names so as to appear to be US persons and groups. From these accounts, Defendants and their co-conspirators registered or linked to online social media accounts in order to monitor them; posed as US persons when requesting assistance from real US persons; contacted media outlets in order to promote activities inside the United States; and conducted other operations, such as those set forth below. \n\n>**Use of Stolen US Identities**\n\n>41..

By approximately May 2014, Defendants and their co-conspirators discussed efforts to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election. Defendants and their co-conspirators began to monitor US social media accounts and other sources of information about the 2016 US presidential election. \n\n>43.. By 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used their fictitious online personas to interfere with the 2016 US presidential election. They engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump. \n\n>45.. Defendants and their co-conspirators also used false US personas to communicate with unwitting members, volunteers, and supporters of the Trump Campaign involved in local community outreach, as well as grassroots groups that supported then-candidate Trump. These individuals and entities at times distributed the ORGANIZATION\'s materials through their own accounts via retweets, reposts, and similar means.

This alert provides information on Russian government actions targeting U.S. Government entities as well as organizations in the energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation, and critical manufacturing sectors. It also contains indicators of compromise (IOCs) and technical details on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by Russian government cyber actors on compromised victim networks. DHS and FBI produced this alert to educate network defenders to enhance their ability to identify and reduce exposure to malicious activity.\n\n>DHS and FBI characterize this activity as a multi-stage intrusion campaign by Russian government cyber actors who targeted small commercial facilities’ networks where they staged malware, conducted spear phishing, and gained remote access into energy sector networks. After obtaining access, the Russian government cyber actors conducted network reconnaissance, moved laterally, and collected information pertaining to Industrial Control Systems (ICS).\n\n________________\n\n1) [Justice Department - Indictment of 13 Russians and 3 entities](https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download)\n\n2) [BBC - Russians conducted \'information warfare\' on US election](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-43092569/russians-conducted-information-warfare-on-us-election)\n\n3) [Department of Homeland Security: United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) - Russian Government Cyber Activity Targeting Energy and Other Critical Infrastructure Sectors](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A)'

'The Constitution requires the POTUS to uphold the law and the Constitution itself.  If he\'s pardoning co-conspirators essentially as a means of obstructing justice where he\'s involved in the underlying crime(s), then there\'s a good argument to invalidate those pardons as a reasonable and necessary check on the Presidential pardon power.  (For example, a POTUS shouldn\'t be able to tell someone "Go commit such-and-such crime for my benefit, and if you\'re caught I\'ll pardon you.")\n\nThe "Nixon as unindicted co-conspirator" tack wasn\'t really exercised because Ford ended up as POTUS and issued the pardon, and Ford wasn\'t involved in Watergate.'

'They likely will play the ‘we wanted to stop him but the Democrats wouldn’t let us’ card.  \n\nThat will play well with the NeverTrump Republicans, and will seem plausible as an escape hatch for the Trumpians who want out. '
'Pence would be poor candidate. He would carry the baggage of the impeachent/resignation and not have the advantage of running a an incumbent (this cost Ford). Unlike Trump he\'s a poor public speaker, uncharismatic. He\'s not very competent, he\'s an religious extremist. He would lose.\n\nIf Trump runs he will probably be re-elected (do not wish this but it is what it ise) *if* the economy holds up. Advantages:\n\n* Generally, people get tired of Party X if it\'s been in power for eight years or more. The new party then is usually given a full eight years before the people get tired of *them*. The one exception is Carter (before that, Grover Cleveland, and I\'m not even sure about that). This greatly favors Trump.\n\n* Remember, some people voted for Al Gore but then decided "Well, after seeing George W. Bush\'s first term, I\'m switching to him" (!) If *George Bush* can do this then Trump can.\n\n* Trump is a *terrible* President, but he\'s an excellent public speaker and a good campaigner.\n\n* We can assume the same treatment from Russian bots and trolls, and the same voter suppression. An maybe the Russians can hack the voting machines,\n\nIf the economy tanks, Trump will lose anyway. If it\'s pretty good, he\'ll probably win. If there\'s a big Muslim terrorist attack in America near the election, he will win in a landslide. Pence would probably lose.'
'Well, he was asked if it affected the election and he said he wouldn\'t get into the impact, but they didn\'t see evidence that votes were changed.\n\nUnder the way he\'s defining it, he\'s allowing that enough Americans may have chosen Trump or shown up for Trump because of propaganda that it put him over the top, but they aren\'t even attempting to assess that.  I sincerely don\'t know if I believe him or not, but I can understand why they might not get into such a tough hypothetical questions like "Would people have elected Trump anyway absent Russian propaganda".'
"If Trump is removed I doubt Pence would even run. \n\n> excellent public speaker\n\nTrump is a terrible public speaker by any objective measure. He rambles endlessly and can barely form a coherent sentence. BING BING BING. I'll grant that his speaking is POPULAR with his base.\n\nThe investigation is still a big wild card. Anything could happen."
'That sounds like a big number, but look at his razor thin victory margin and his abysmal public approval rating. Primaries are decided by party loyalists but generals are decided by independents and swing voters.\n\nBesides, the other shoe has yet to drop. '
'Well i mean popular *is* good, almost by definition, when you\'re talking about public speaking with the intent to persuade. \n\nTrump has a way of ending statements with like "...and it\'s very, very easy. We\'re going to do it and we\'re going to do it very quickly". He drops his pitch and volume in a "turning away" way that communicates "I mean of course we\'re going to do it. That\'s so obviously true that it\'s really not even worth saying. Only an idiot can\'t see that. You\'re not a idiot, are you?" It\'s the equivalent of a math professor handwaving with "...and after that, the solution is trivial".\n\nJust because he\'s a bad *person* doesn\'t mean he\'s a bad *campaigner*. He is. I mean Hitler was an effective public speaker too.'
"Hitler's skill as an orator puts Trump to absolute shame. They're not even in the same league.

"I won't discount the possibility that he wins another term. I won't even discount the possibility that he calls for a violent revolt, or moves to amend the constitution to eliminate presidential term limits and fixes however many elections he lives for. I didn't think he had a chance in hell of being president but here he is in all his orange glory. I'm confident things will get better, somebody, but they could get a lot worse in the meantime.\n\nThis is interesting reading, and slightly comforting, given that demagogues historically usually come to bad end, but discomforting to think about who they take with them https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogue"
"Former POTUS Nixon was pardoned pre-emptively, before any charges were brought against him.  What's stopping Donald from doing that? He could issue a pre-emptive blanket pardon for any and all federal crimes committed by Michael  Cohen, no?\n\nEither Donald isn't aware he can do that, or he has no intention of pardoning him.  If Donald pardons Michael, then Michael can not use the 5th. Incriminating himself is impossible at that point, and he would be compelled to testify.\n\nIs that the fly in the ointment?  Sorry, not really up on US law."
'He will still gas light the shit out of us.'
"Michael Cohen is in an impossible situation.  He's sandwiched between a corrupt mob-boss of a President and the unlimited resources of S.C. Mueller.  And he has done some awful things for himself and many others.\n\nAs powerful as the Presidency is, it's not unlimited.  As many have mentioned, Trump could issue a pardon for any and all crimes committed at the federal level. And while this might be great for Dinesh Douchebag D'souza, who had a quite uncomplicated conviction to vacate, Michael Cohen is another story. \n\nMichael Cohen is likely staring at not only federal charges but charges in other jurisdictions.  That includes NY state and who knows what other states.  It's not like Michael Cohen only committed crimes in New York.  In addition, he likely has committed crimes in other countries and is eligible to be extradited.  On top of that, even if Cohen is pardoned at the federal level, that doesn't make all of the evidence taken from his office, home, etc. go away.  It's still there and it implicates dozens, probably hundreds of other people.\n\nBottom line, Michael Cohen, like Paul Manafort, is a treasure trove of information and evidence and whether they receive a federal pardon or not is almost immaterial."
"Yo I know it feels like that, but you need to remember that nearly 50&#37; of the country does not vote.  Considering Spanky and Hillary nearly split the election, that's 25&#37; each.    \n\n\nIt's very important to recognize that vast majority that doesn't vote because it absolutely caused Spanky to win. If no one votes, and there's a surge of any kind (including a surge of a bunch of assholes), then that surge can easily put someone over the top.  "
'**Michael Cohen is an American attorney who worked as a lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump. Prior to that he was a Vice President of the Trump Organization.**\n\n**The Trump–Russia dossier, published in January 2017, alleges that Cohen met with Russian officials in Prague, Czech Republic in 2016 with the objective of paying those who had hacked the DNC and to "cover up all traces of the hacking operation".** Cohen has denied the allegations against him, stating that he was in Los Angeles between August 23 and 29, and in New York for the entire month of September. According to a Czech intelligence source, there is no record of him entering Prague by plane, but Respekt magazine and Politico pointed out that he could have entered by car or train from a neighboring country within the Schengen Area, for example Italy. In the latter case, a record of Cohen entering the Schengen zone from a non-Schengen country should exist.\n\n**However, on April 13, 2018, the DC Bureau of McClatchy Newspapers reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has evidence that Cohen did travel to Prague during the late-summer of 2016, with two sources having confirmed this secret trip. The evidence is said to show that Cohen entered the Czech Republic from Germany, and since both countries are in European Union\'s Schengen passport area, Cohen would not have received a passport stamp to enter Czech territory.** The following day, Cohen again denied he has "ever been to Prague". Cohen also said that he didn\'t travel to the European Union in August 2016.\n\n**In late January 2017, Cohen met with Ukrainian opposition politician Andrey Artemenko and Felix Sater at the Loews Regency in Manhattan to discuss a plan to lift sanctions against Russia.** The proposed plan would require that Russian forces withdraw from eastern Ukraine and that Ukraine hold a referendum on whether Crimea should be "leased" to Russia for 50 or 100 years. **Cohen was given a written proposal in a sealed envelope that he delivered to then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn in early February.**\n\n**On April 3, 2017, Cohen was appointed a National Deputy Finance Chairman of the Republican National Committee.** In April 2017, Cohen also formed an alliance with Squire Patton Boggs for legal and lobbying counsel on behalf of Trump.\n\nIn May 2017, amidst expanding inquiries into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, two congressional panels asked Cohen to provide information about any communications he had with people connected to the Russian government. **He was also a subject of the Mueller investigation in 2018.**\n\n**In 2017, an LLC that Cohen established received $500,000 from Columbus Nova, a US offshoot of businesses owned by Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg.** Vekselberg is a business partner of Soviet-born billionaire and major Republican Party donor, Leonard Blavatnik. **In March 2018, members from Robert Mueller\'s team of special counsel investigators questioned Vekselberg at a New York area airport. In April 2018, the United States imposed sanctions on him and 23 other Russian nationals.**'

'Again this is all just speculation hypothetical but what the heck...If Trump pardons, I assume it will be a "blanket" pardon for "all crimes."  Then all that is left is state level charges in New York *if* those can even be brought.\n\nOn the other hand, Cohen spills the beans before he is pardoned because he gets spooked that he won\'t get one.  But even if this happens we don\'t even know what beans he has to spill.\n\nRight now he just seems to be trolling for reactions either from prosecutors or from Trump. '

'**Hillary Clinton email controversy**\n\nThe Hillary Clinton email controversy was a major public controversy arising from the use by  Hillary Clinton of her family\'s private email server for official communications during her tenure as United States Secretary of State rather than official State Department email accounts maintained on secure federal servers. Those official communications included over 100 emails which contained classified information (but did not have classification markings) at the time they were sent, as well as 2,093 emails which were not marked classified but would retroactively be ranked as "confidential" by the State Department. Post-election analyses of media coverage during the 2016 presidential campaign show that the Clinton email controversy received the most extensive coverage of any topic.The controversy unfolded against the backdrop of Clinton\'s 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the United States House Select Committee on Benghazi. Some experts, officials, and members of Congress contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures, as well as federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

"In his mind, trump thinks fighting IS winning. In life, he gets away with it because of the money he has. Even when loses, he never feels it cause he's still rich and he tells himself he won afterwards. So he has spent all of his life acting like a jackass doing anything he wants and thinking he's winning when he's actually losing.\n\nSo for him to say no to mueller's interview is unimaginable. He would view that as losing. His mind works based off on a win/lose mentality and that fighting in of itself is winning. For once in his life maybe he will see what losing really is"
"> I'm sure he quit because of how innocent Trump is, right?\n\nDo you even know how lawyers work?"
'I think trump appearing in front of Mueller could be the very best piece of video ever.'
"At his level they'll decline a paycheck to protect their reputation as well.  Working for the POTUS is fantastic at getting you other high-powered clients as long as it isn't *this* POTUS.  Nobody wants to hire the lawyer whose client was impeached and potentially jailed."
'the prequel was pretty good! '
'I mean a candidate basically colluding with a foreign adversary to win the presidency should be way bigger of a history lesson for generations. But like you said, I feel like the era of post-truth will make it seem just less than important than Watergate was.'
'> I keep imagining a kid learning about all this awful stuff in school and then going home to grandpa to talk about it. Whereupon Grandpa starts ranting about how Trump was the greatest president ever.\n\nI think the vast majority of the MAGA people will distance themselves from Trump once he\'s proven to be completely ineffective (which thankfully he is, barely passing one piece of legislation with both houses of Congress ostensibly on his side) and when Mueller takes him down with hard proof that he worked with Putin they\'ll immediately pretend they never liked him that much anyway.  \n\nThese aren\'t people with long attention spans or strong convictions other than rooting for their "team", once their team has a new captain they\'ll move on from the old one pretty quickly IMHO.'
"> For instance, a lawyer may be required to resign if he knows his client intends to commit perjury. It’s actually a complicated issue when balanced with a lawyer’s duty to zealously defend a client.\n\nLawyer here. This is almost certainly what's going on. It's a signal that Dowd is very, very sure that Trump would commit a crime (e.g., perjury or obstruction of justice). In that circumstance, he would have an ethical obligation to report on his own client. No attorney wants to do that--it's horribly injurious to your reputation and will understandably put you in a ton of hot water with the bar, who's going to micro-analyze everything that led up to the predicament. And if you have a client like Trump, good lord. He would sue you in every way possible.\n\nSo yeah, he's resigning before he triggers his ethical obligation to narc on his boi.\n\nIf I were Dowd, I'd be putting my malpractice insurance carrier on notice ASAP. That would be a hilarious letter. \n\n> Dear Insurance Company, \n\n> You see this shit on the news? Yeah. All that.\n\n> Holla back,\n\n> Johnny D"

Sudden coups might have worked before the internet but today he'd need the total backing of the people or the army, neither of which are realistic. \n\nOne of the real positives to a democratic republic like ours is that no one can assume that kind of power without consent. And while we may not like Trump, the only reason he's in office is because he technically gained that consent. But people like Mueller and several governors across the union are clearly challenging his power and weakening him daily. "
'All he needs to do is put more fuel on this “the deep state is out to get me” fire that the Russian trolls started and a lot of Amendment 2 people become his militia.\n\nI think this feeds in to his inaction on securing our elections.  \n\nWhat’s the best way to consolidate power?  Claim the next election is illegitimate because of Russian hacking.  So therefore he wouldn’t need to leave office until this issue is resolved.

'I’m aware of all of this, and agree. It only furthers my point. The president cannot be impeached for pardoning himself because that is a backwards sequence of events. '
'I share it literally daily.  I encourage others to do the same.'
'He can be impeached for whatever congress wants and deems “high crimes and misdemeanors”. Take whatever value you want from that and whether it makes you happy or sad. But pardoning oneself makes a good case of an impeachable obstruction of justice (it would not stand in criminal court—doing one of your privileges as president (issuing pardons) is not a criminal act).'
'I think you are sidestepping the point. The sequence of events is important. He must first be impeached (for whatever congress sees fit) and then convicted (a step Clinton and others never made it to). In order for ANY pardon to occur, a conviction must have occurred. In order for Trump to pardon himself, he would have to be convicted, and that can only come after an impeachment. Therefore, he can’t be impeached for pardoning himself because he would have already been impeached if he was in a position to be eligible for pardon. '
"He can pardon himself before a conviction. Ex Parte Garland (1867) held that his pardon power is “unlimited” and “It extends to every offense known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken, or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment.''\n\nMurphy v. Ford (1975), a district court dismissed the suit against Ford for pardoning Nixon before indictment citing Ex Parte Garland. "
"Doesn't matter, vote anyway. What do you know about your congressional district, is it competitive? Is there at least a primary? On top of that, we need to run up the score on the Republicans, make them scared and have to waste resources defending every seat. \n\nBesides, I love voting, it feels great. Even though I don't live in a competitive district. "
'But a reason why it might not be competitive could be that people *feel* it’s not competitive, and do not vote. Obviously this is an edge case, but I’m sure there are some districts where if people were more energetic about voting the tide would turn. Hopefully he does!'

I don’t really care if you spam it, just show him the truth. '
'The problem is the truth doesn’t matter anymore; it’s about competing narratives. Trump will continue to lie and offer an alternate version of reality to appease his base. That’s really all that matters to him now- keeping his base on his side, and if you look at the polls, he has been very successful even after Helsinki he still has 70% approval among Republicans. Trump will continue to undermine the truth and our democracy to keep himself in power including firing Mueller, installing a sympathetic Justice who will side with him when he postpones the 2020 election. Trump only cares about himself; he has no moral character or sense of duty towards his country. It will take a massive populist movement to oust him; similar to what happens on dictatorships. '
"So it comes down to this:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTrump is absolutely, literally, without a doubt, a complete idiot who is so narcissistic and greedy and corrupt and oblivious that he hasn't got a clue that he was suddenly hoisted to the presidency fraudulently by russian spy ring, and doesn't care because he truly believes it's an honest win and he's a legitimate president, and putin's got his back - he's a good old dude...\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOR\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe's a corrupt, narcissistic piece of shit who has been dirty dealing with russians for decades, to whom he owes his true allegiances...and was groomed by putin to be a plant / agent / spy for the sole purpose of pulling a fucking coup in the government of the usa...\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd yet people think this is an issue best handled by....voting????\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHope you'll remember that when you wake up on your knees in a camp somewhere."

"I am a lawyer. That's largely correct, though there are broadly two types of subpoenas: those for documents and those for testimony. This appears to be for documents.\n\nI don't have anything to do with criminal law, so I don't 100% stand by the following, but if the process is anything like civil litigation, you generally subpoena documents first. If the documents further support your case, you then subpoena testimony where you ask questions, which are at least partially based on what you learned in the documents. These are broad assumptions because you don't need to subpoena the opposing party in civil litigation (they're required to comply with requests for production of documents without needing a subpoena). That said, the processes and strategies should be fairly similar; the terminology and standards are what tend to vary."

Falsifying his financial reports to hide the money is the violation. \n\nThere are records of a meeting in Trump tower where Trumps campaign chief and his son went to get information about Clinton from a Russian agent.

"You alright my friend bro? Let's hooka and talk stuff out. We can take my BMW or yours. "
'Trolling? I don’t follow.  Mueller clearly doesn’t want someone he’s investigating to know his next step.  We know that the pumpkin pop tart sees a headline and has a knee jerk reaction.  I love the entertainment but more than anything I want him to not be my president!'
"Pretty much this. Even if he gets enough evidence it's not clear he can bring any charges up until Trump is impeached, and Dems winning in 2018 is a must for that to happen.

"It's why people were shocked when Trump won the election to begin with...and the reason why the first step to a 12-step program is ADMISSION. There's a FANTASTIC degree of self-deception coming from both the Republicans and the Democrats, regarding how much true support they have and how much support the other party has. Trump isn't going ANYWHERE...not without a heck of a fight first. He still has tremendous support from those who voted for him. As I've said elsewhere: he's more likely to give up than be removed"

"Mueller can issue as many indictments as he wishes, he has that power.  The onus would then be on congress and the senate to move on impeachment.  If they don't at that point it would largely be viewed as obstruction of justice, though there likely wouldn't be charges."
'You know, I’m automatically attracted to indictments. I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. I just indict. I don’t even wait.'
"To use Trump's own example, if the president stood in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shot somebody, *then* could he be indicted? This is a great unanswered question of constitutional law that basically needs a Supreme Court decision to resolve it. Another one we may soon find the answer to: can the president pardon himself?"

Trump has used what parts of the GOP he wants and discards the rest. \n\nIts clear that the GOP has become co-dependent on Trump, a love and abuse relationship that the GOP cannot seem to handle or have not a clue on how to end it. They sold their base to Trump & Co. when they allowed the White Supremacists and rabid "no-nothing" anti-immigrant "deplorable" to take over. They gave Donald Trump the loudest "dog-whistle" and taught him how to use it.\n\nThe GOP needs help and if has to be tough love.

'Here in Arizona, while the GOP has shrunk, or had a very low or negative growth rate, the Independents have grown and are now the largest segment of the voters, as all three are around 32-33%, so its pretty equal. While the independents are not republican, they are social and fiscal conservatives and tend to vote that way. They can be swayed though, but only with much re-assurance and hand holding. Do not be fooled by Trumps recent rallies here, he is not real welcome and only the most conservative Republican bastions of North and SE Phoenix support him (and Sheriff Joe) The people are not happy here as you can tell by both Jeff Flake and Sen McCain, who most hold here, either Republican, Independents and even some Democrats, with a bit of reverence,or at least respect\n\nI think the Dems here will gain some seats (1-3) in the House, but if they win a seat in the Senate, the republican party here will drop its support of trumpettts like a hot tamale cooking on the streets of Phoenix mid-day.

"A brief case against this subreddit, intended with the greatest of respect to all parties involved:\n\nBob Muller is an honorable man whose job is to seek the truth of the matter concerning our President.  He was chosen because he would be seen as competent figure with broad, bipartisan support. Initially, he was clearly seen as such.  This is important, as to maintain some semblance of unity going forward from whatever discoveries he may make, he needs to be trusted by all sides.  Various parties have been trying to undermine this by painting the situation as Trump vs. Muller. While I do not think this subreddit was created with the intention of pushing this narrative, I'm afraid that it does play into it.  Muller should be viewed first and foremost as someone seeking the truth.  If he is viewed as Trump's rival by the general public, Trump can try to paint the investigation as unfair, a witch hunt, etcetera, and some portion of the public will eat it up.  Because this subreddit would play into a narrative that would delegitimization Mueller's investigation, I cannot support it."

"I consider this to be the most convincing detail:\n\n>The official story is that Davidson reached out to Cohen, who then contacted Broidy.\xa0Why in the world would Davidson tell Cohen about an illicit affair involving Broidy?\xa0Cohen was Trump’s lawyer, not Broidy’s.\xa0Cohen didn’t represent Broidy at that time and therefore had no duty of confidentiality or loyalty to Broidy (or Bechard for that matter).\xa0And the information that Broidy had an affair with Bechard was extremely sensitive, as Bechard was set to make seven figures for agreeing to keep that information private.\n\n>Spilling the beans to Cohen, who would then have been free to tell anyone else what Davidson had told him, would risk Bechard’s payoff in two ways.\xa0If Cohen failed to keep Broidy and Bechard’s affair confidential, the settlement value to Broidy of a potential nondisclosure agreement could have been greatly diminished or even completely destroyed.\xa0Also, Cohen merely knowing about Broidy’s supposed affair could have jeopardized both Broidy’s position as co-chair of the Republican National Committee’s finance committee — a position he actually shared with, of all people, Cohen — and his elaborate and ongoing influence-peddling with the government.\xa0(Someone who has had conversations with Davidson about this matter says that, according to Davidson, Broidy did not even know Cohen before he contacted him about Bechard.)\n\nAlso is anybody asking how Davidson happens to be the lawyer representing the women in all three incidents? Keep in mind all three dumped him after coming to the conclusion he had Trump's priorites in mind above theirs.\n"
'They’ll say that when she told him she was pregnant, he begged her to carry it to full term.  He even promised to care for her and the child financially.  But the woman read some Planned Parenthood pamphlet which convinced her that abortion was easy and fun, so she did it.  Then when Trump found out about the abortion, he cried in despair, because he believes every life is sacred.  And of course, it’s all Hillary’s fault.  Lock her up, lock her up.  '

'I was wondering why the administration was so buddy buddy with Saudi Arabia right off the bat, and kind of snubbed our actual allies in Europe.

'The original NY Times article explains it\n\n>\tCrown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, the de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates, and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, the king’s main adviser, had long opposed many of the Obama administration’s policies toward the Middle East. They resented President Barack Obama’s agreement with Iran over its nuclear program, his statements of support for the Arab Spring uprisings and his hands-off approach to the Syrian civil war.\n\n>\tNews outlets linked to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates fiercely criticized Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, when she was secretary of state, and diplomats familiar with their thinking say both princes hoped for a president who would take a stronger hand in the region against both Iran and groups like the Muslim Brotherhood.'

'So, basically, the Supreme Court might adopt the position that instead of a President the USA has a King? (Or Queen, although that seems unlikely in light of the last election).'
'Ok, so you can’t charge a sitting president. For the sake of argument, I’ll go along with it. After all, they can just pardon themselves to get out of it. Therefore, they’d need to be impeached first. What must happen for an impeachment? Well. There have to be crimes, which then need to be investigated. Or should even the act of investigating be held off on til after they’ve left office, where evidence is missing, gone or cold, memories are foggy, and even statutes of limitations have run their course?\n\nIs this guy actually saying that investigations of sitting presidents shouldn’t take place? \n\nWouldn’t John Gotti have loved it if he had gotten to choose his entire jury and which judge should preside over his case?\n\nIf anything, because of the extreme amount of trust and power given to the office, anyone occupying it should be held more accountable to the law than the average citizen, not less. '
'He says he believes that impeachment is a solution for removing a President from office, not indictment or prosecution, but he also believes that the President should be immune from investigation. If the President cannot even be investigated, how can we come to point where we are sure that he/she should be impeached? It seems like a contradiction.'
'Provide the source, this looks like it’s from a law review journal. \n\nGive us the source, and everyone should send this excerpt to their senate representatives and say you want them to push for this question to be asked at the confirmation hearing. We want to know for a fact, under oath, that he doesn’t hold this belief or will not act on it, or that he will, either way. \n\nThis is legal strategy, because if he says no, and pushes for this idea later, he would’ve effectively lied in his confirmation hearing, and if he says yes, this is a piece Mueller can use as circumstantial evidence for Trumps obstruction of justice charge. '
"Okay, I'm more interested who found Kavanaugh to be nominated. It's not like Trump would go through all potential Supreme Court candidates to weed out this piece of info.\n\nAnd what a coincidence that Kennedy is retiring for this guys name to come up so fast."
'I do find it amusing that he wrote that essentially defending Clinton. Saying that investigation distracted him from running the country. \n\nAnd some are taking it as him being a trump supporter/defender.  That’s not really the case at all. \n\nClinton’s investigation was essentially completely irrelevant to him being president or his job as president until he lied under oath.   Trump on the other hand, potentially working with a foreign country to win an election and perhaps still working with them is a completely different sort of issue that directly effects his ability as president. \n\nI don’t see anyway Kavanaugh would suggest stopping the mueller probe at this point. As trump is still not even labeled as a/the subject of the probe. \n\nI mean I understand people are going to flip out because trump nominated Kavanaugh. But tbh kavanuagh is a moderate, he’s in all likelihood the best possible nomination we would get from trump. '
'I hope he thinks that way.  We need someone with the countrys best interest in mind.  We don\'t need a "stacked court" that trump\'s case might be decided by.\n'
'You mean he did his job to the best of his abilities when working on the Starr report? Oh the horror. We should much prefer a person who half asses his job. Your argument here is the equivalent of you wanting Mueller to not do his job if Trump was a Democrat.  I on the other hand want all investigations handled as thoroughly and professionally as possible.  And I agree with Kavanaugh that if the investigation is largely irrelevant into how the president is actually governing the country, that the investigation should take place after his presidency. \n\nHe specifically mentions Clinton in his article and how the investigation into Clinton distracted Clinton from being able to run the country.  How you see that but anything as supportive of Clinton I do not know. \n\n\n\n'
"That is the traditional understanding of executive immunity. A special prosecutor would typically refer his findings to Congress and recommend impeachment. Mueller indicting Trump would be *Mueller* breaking the norm.\n\nOf course, I don't think the drafters of the Constitution envisioned a complicit Congress that would never impeach, which takes the bite away from impeachment, to say the least."
"Doing his job is not equivalent to pursuing an aggressive approach in an investigation. Those who use less aggressive methods on reasonable grounds may just as well be fulfilling their role. Kavanaugh's problem is that his own words can be utilized to criticize his actions, and it is difficult to say he was completely free from political bias while forming that opinion.\n\nIf the American Supreme Court rulings weren't so partisan themselves, what you said would be reasonable: both parties should not use Supreme Court nominees for their political gain. Unfortunately that is not the case, as their rulings on many contentious issues such as same sex marriage, pollution, race and redistrcting, Citizens United, ACA, and Bush v. Gore were decided by 5-4 votes along the party lines. I should also remind you that many conservatives who disliked Trump held their nose and voted for him particularly because he would fill the judicial positions with conservatives. As some of his most unqualified judicial nominees have been confirmed because of his conservative credentials, it makes little sense for Democrats to let Republicans do whatever they want with the courts. GOP's judiciary and Supreme Court takeover will have a powerful effect on the society for the next decades, on everything from the environment and healthcare to civil rights and corporate finance. This will be the biggest damage Trump has done."
'It is though. You take whatever (legal or ethical) approach you can to accomplish the goal.  Which he did. Personal opinion can’t stop you from doing your job. That’s exactly a qualification you want for a Supreme Court Justice \n\nIf you look at how Kavanaugh has ruled, he has ruled against his party on big topics many times. He is not a party follower with his rulings. '
"His opinions have been similar to where his party stands regarding key issues such as environment and national surveillance. On the issue of abortion and ACA, though he did not give what some right-wingers had hoped, he still leans conservative. There is uncertainty as to what he will do to them as Supreme Court justice, but his opinions won't be any savior to liberals. Some hardline conservatives indeed opposed his nomination because of their own purity test, yet it does not mean Republicans oppose him as a whole, as other conservative groups have pushed Kavanaugh's nomination. His opinions will definitely not be free from his own conservative agenda (just as none of the Supreme Court justices have been), and they will be more favorable to GOP than Roberts and Kennedy's have been."
'Oh, hey, interesting, it’s almost like the whole thing was set up beforehand. '

'A true attempt at undermining any sense of a justice system working against those who are loyal to trump. He is trying to show Manafort, Flynn, Cohen, etc. that he has their back if they lie for him. Truly a despicable abuse of power. '
'I mean Trump is a test case for allowing people in higher office to have the power to pardon.  In my opinion, some of the pardons given by Clinton, Bush, and Obama were horrible miscarriages of justice.  Perhaps we need to reconsider ending the ability of a president or governor to pardon anyone.   '
"So he's most likely pardoning assets that will be used to help him and Russians?"
"Both parties and all Americans should support the rule of law.  Only traitors don't."
"The appeals process should be protecting innocent life from being wrongly taken.  If that isn't working we shouldn't just empower a single fickle politician with the power to change the law whenever they see fit.  If the appeals process has problems, then we should address them directly. \n\nTrump also hasn't done anything with his pardon power that is unique yet.  I don't know if he's going to try and pardon himself though.  It wouldn't shock me.    "
'I don’t think most Trump supporters are good people. Sorry. I have no sympathy for the hillbillies'
'\n"I\'m sure that as soon as Fox, Breitbart, and infowars can no longer outright deny Trump\'s guilt, the majority of his 35% approval rating will turn against him depending on the crimes he is charged with."\n\nI enjoy your optimism, it is rare in these dark times. I hope you are right otherwise I don\'t know how we will resolve this peacefully.\n\n"We need to focus on educating a discerning nature into people without alienating them."\n\nI have been thinking on this for years and you are completely right. I was wondering if you had anymore input you could expand on? I can\'t wrap mind around how big the problem is or determine a sensible policy solution that would be fast enough. Fund education, duh, but that will take decades.'
'This is the perfect explanation of the current paradigm for politics.  Well said.'
"Just because bush wasn't impeached doesn't mean people all of a sudden like him. Just look at oj just because he won his trial doesn't mean his life turned out well. Especially since he kept committing crimes like I'm sure trump will."
"You must live in a very insulated world if you think all Trump supporters are hillbillies or all hillbillies are bad people.\n\nThe worst Trump supporters are by far the rich well educated conservatives who are taking advantage of poor governance to capture regulatory bodies and amass greater wealth. Just as bad are the racists. But there are plenty of Trump supporters that don't fall into these categories. Most of what's left are good people.\n\nIf you don't believe me I suggest you go out and meet some people from outside of your political hidey-hole. I'm from a family of conservatives. Many of my relatives are Trump supporters because they've been told to be Trump supporters. These are also the people who have taught me to exercise tolerance, to help others, and to love openly and often.\n\nIf you can't operate under a pretense of empathy, or if you assume 35% of Americans are beneath you, you will never change anyone's mind."
'Exactly. I had a little just after the election because those that thought Trump was going to work for them had been conned. But after everything that has come out post-election I have zero sympathy for any Trump loyalist with their head still in the sand.'
"We need more empathic discussion.\n\nWe need to be the people reaching out and having thoughtful conversations with others. About politics yes, but we need to focus on how the other party in the conversation feels and why they feel the way they do. We need to present facts in a way that guides the other party's emotions in a positive direction. \n\nWe need to start more political conversations in neutral environments, but we need to do so with tolerance and without judgement. Befriend people and discuss their opinions then discuss, in a friendly manner, why you think the way you do.\n\nThis takes a large amount of time and can be very frustrating. Don't engage on days where you aren't up to snuff. People can sense when you're getting frustrated and sometimes you may say things in a way that puts them off further.\n\nAs far as making people more discerning, this is harder than changing people's minds.  Read articles with them, if it's appropriate, then discuss what you thought about it. Keep in mind certain things:\n\nRhetoric vs. Factual argument\n\nOpinion pieces are held to much lower journalistic standards\n\nHistory and motive of author\n\nThe only way we can change people's minds is by genuinely caring about the way that they think. That means that we will have the most success in discussions with people we care about where we force ourselves to be empathetic and patient."
"I would also like to share some thoughts that keep me levelheaded and more personable in political discussions.\n\nI strongly believe that you and I and every other human being are absolutely no different in our core. Under the right genetic and experiential circumstances I believe that anyone could be an Albert Einstein, highly influential with incredible concern for the human condition. Conversely, I also believe that anyone, under the exact wrong conditions, is capable of great atrocity. In this way every other person is a mirror in which we can see ourselves.\n\nThis might be stupid to you or anyone else reading this, but this thought has helped guide me through the most important conversations I've had with other people and I think it will help guide me through a few more. I hope that it helps anyone who reads this find the patience to change other people's minds."
"Guys, Boris is right.  Hear him out.  \n\nHe's just trying to make America as great as it used to be, like before the Civil Rights Act and stuff."
"Lot of people have assured me of that since the inauguration\n\nHere's hoping you'll be the first one of them to be right"
"They like Bush a lot more now that we have Trump. God, I hope former President Trump's doesn't get rehabilitated the same way."
"Forgive me a lapse of conviction. It's been a long century these past two years, and I need some self care I guess."

'I don’t know... But, if I’m going to do a little purely hi-octane speculation:\n\n1. Partnership to undermine and cooperate against something China is doing.\n\n2. Letting the Russians know that if they continue with their all out fuckery with our democratic process, we have some sort of kill switch in place that will seriously fuck them six ways from Sunday. Maybe we’ll false flag some sort of attack on ourselves or another country and blame them. Or maybe they’ve planned something similar and we’re letting them know we’re on to them.\n\n3.

'My only solace in this whole shitshow is that the Russians (or unwitting supporters of the Russians) like this guy, are completely F****** moronic.'
'Well, no, I agree that the crew you listed are both dirty, and complicit. Ryan\'s "family" comment, McConnell\'s threat to make any announcement about concerns over Russian campaign meddling into a partisan shitstorm etc are pretty good indications of that. Also the [Dallas Morning News\'](https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2017/12/15/putins-proxies-helped-funnel-millions-gop-campaigns) investigations - pretty direct evidence of entanglement with Russian campaign money.\n\nI still hold out hope that the majority of the Congressional GOP are *just* complicit in the coverup and the refusal to act, and *not* actually implicated and guilty of crimes, but that hope fades a little more every day.'
'If someone is complicit in the coverup it is almost certain they have a partial knowledge of the greater crimes. Assuming they are not guilty of these crimes themselves.\n\n'
'This exchange stuck with me all this time, and always bugged me that nobody seems to remember it.\n\nTrump people seem to write off the "Russia if you\'re listening" comment as a joke -- but this clearly shows it wasn\'t a joke.'
"Yeah... Maybe if we saw the whole thing in context it'd be more clear, or a transcript. I'm posting this stuff from a perspective of intellectual integrity as I do wish Trump would get impeached asap."
'So the Pay to Play internet plan the Trump administration tried to push was because they were getting paid off millions by AT&T. \n\nMakes sense why a bunch of old lobbyists were so concerned over a bill dissolving the free internet for Americans.'

'I love when people talk about Trump and polls... reminds of the Clinton 92% & Trump 8% chance of winning, the NYT put out before the election. Please screencap this so I can eat my words.'
"It isn't a poll of Fox News viewers.\n\nIt's a poll of all registered voters, taken by ODC, Opinion Dynamics Corp.\n\nAlmost all News organizations outsource their polls. The firewall between the news organizations and polls was best demonstrated in 2012 when Fox News was condemning polls showing Obama will be favored while failing to mention that their own Fox News/ODC poll was the one that most heavily favored Obama.\n\nThe only poll that's notoriously biased is Rasmussen, which is why you hear Trump quoting it all the time."
"Because we admire the Special Counsel and his team for not leaking information. They are here for justice, not glory, and talking about their case has zero value for them or for us.  \n  \nBy comparison, look at what happened when the Special Counsel team handed over their evidence regarding Michael Cohen to the Manhattan FBI and US Attorney's offices: leaks, leaks, leaks."
"Depends how you look at it.\n\nThere are three types of populations for polls.\n\n**Adults**\n\n**Registered Voters** - a subset of Adults\n\n**Likely Voters** - a subset of Registered Voters\n\nGallup, and a couple others use **Adults**, meaning **All Adults across the US**.\n\nMost Organizations use **Registered Voters**, except when it's polling for a specific election, in which case they'll use **Likely Voters**, a subset of Registered Voters that are deemed Likely vote using the polling organizations desired methodology.\n\nIn the case of Rasmussen, all polls are **Likely Voters**. This is bizarre because even approval rating, a measurement in which most voters aren't even asked if they are likely to vote in any specific election, are somehow selected by Rasmussen using their own flexible methodology.\n\nSo that makes you wonder how Rasmussen selects for **Likely Voters** as a subset within the respondents. Unfortunately, you won't find the full methodology being released. You also won't find the raw data ever being released to any of the official polling organization for review. The fact that they release neither their methodology nor their data is incredibly suspect.\n\nBear in mind, it was once one of the best polling organizations. However, those days are in the past."
'http://fivethirtyeight.com has some very good discussion on this.

Trickle down economics, abolishing the minimum wage, all that garbage is just rich people using Libertarians for their own agenda. It's exactly why it won't work in real life, it only makes the system and the people more easily manipulable when you remove accountability and expect everyone to play nice. In real life, people don't play nice. Our system of government is far from perfect, but a glance at a history book will show you why an absentee government is a bad idea."

"Well I wouldn't be surprised if more than one person was served that subpoena, but yes, that's a definite possibility."
'That isn\'t rehosted. It was originally posted to that news station by AP, according to the credit.

Many of them were in place when that sub was genuinely for political discussion, rather than what it has become now, which is a forum for gossip about Melania, opinion pieces, and speculation. It flat out says in the sidebar now that it\'s for "politcal news", in other words it\'s barely a step removed from facebook. If you subscribe to the sub, you know that every month or so, the mods post a sticky to discuss what the subscribers want to see done. The people who show up can\'t even agree on what they want to see, ie, last month, many of us wanted opinion pieces to be clearly tagged as opinion, because they aren\'t genuinely news. Many others didn\'t care. So it isn\'t happening. Democracy in action there.

'But it\'s on overdrive now. Faux "news" is now a state run propaganda arm of the WH and they aren\'t even hiding it anymore. Everyday they obstruct justice, commit sedition, and flat out lie to people all to try and discredit Mueller. It\'s 24/7 these days. They use words like coup and assasination attempts coming from the FBI. Its scary stuff but the FCC is owned by mango Mussolini as well and they already don\'t classify fox as news it\'s entertainment but they can still get away with calling themselves news for some reason.'
'That’s the thing. To accept a pardon you have to accept guilt, you must make yourself available for further questioning, and you can no longer take the fifth. Guess what happens to your pardon if you lie under oath or to the FBI.

At least, not after they see what happens to the first guy that gets pardoned.'

"My guess is if Trump were to really fire Mueller, he'd be sure to do it either the day before or after Christmas. That way most of the country would be too focused on family time to notice and those who do notice at all could easily be labelled un-American scrooges muddying the holiday spirit and trying to politicise in the wrong venue."

Paul Manafort anyone?\n\nInvestigations takes time, and there have been some major revelations that many people feel are quite important and deserve further investigation. And while you may not find the prosecution to have proven itself meaningfully, many of your fellow citizens feel very differently.\n\nAlso. If there isn't anything to discover, then why should anyone on Trump's team even bother with addressing the investigation? If there ain't anything there, why waste breath acknowledging it? Why not just let it run through to the end, knowing there ain't anything there?\n\nTo me the answer is clear because it's just the way life is: people who don't have anything to hide don't really worry about other folks going through their dirty laundry. \n\nYou may see things differently, but I really do want you to hear that I respect your right to your own perspective and hope you'll grant folks like me the same liberty."
"Do you think Mueller is going to invent evidence some how? Trump himself said Mueller will exonerate him when the investigation is complete, why would he fire someone that will be exonerating him?

If there is nothing to hide, why is he always trying to discredit the investigation?   "
"> Unless Mueller pulls something out of thin air soon this case is looking on the verge of collapse.\n\nI'm honestly curious how you can think this. They've indicted 3 people, flipped Papadopolous and Flynn and the investigation has been non-stop getting new information. \n\nThe investigation has only been going on since May and has only been ramping up, never winding down. It's just incredible to me that people can hold the opinion that the case is collapsing..."
'> a long, rapidly deteriorating investigation that has failed to yield any results\n\nInvestigations that are short are generally inconclusive.\n\nIt\'s certainly not "deteriorating", let alone rapidly, considering that charges are *just* beginning to be filed. Remember, this isn\'t the first time we\'ve seen this process, let alone even the first time for a sitting President. You don\'t take down someone like Flynn for just "lying" unless he\'s giving you something truly useful, and *those* indictments have yet to drop, because like anyone who\'s ever bothered to be *actually* involved in a legal case, you\'d know that you want to make it as airtight as possible, since if it isn\'t and they\'re acquitted, you can never bring a second case due to Constitutional protections against "double jeopardy", so you better be sure you\'ve covered everything possible the first time.\n\nAs for "failed to yield any results", I\'m confused what you think five indictments are. Manafort and Gates were the transition teams\' campaign managers, and they\'re going to be defending themselves in court soon against some pretty hefty federal charges, *before* they then get indicted on a state level. They\'re going to prison. Then you have not one, not two, but *three* individuals who have "flipped" and are cooperating with the FBI in exchange for leniency *if* they bring in the big fish. \n\nThat you think *any* of what you said in that sentence I quoted is true means you\'re either pushing your own narrative (for whatever reason, I don\'t care which because it doesn\'t matter), or you\'re willfully ignorant of what\'s actually going on here, if not just in outright denial because your ego can\'t handle the idea of being wrong.\n\nAs for Fox being "state propaganda", I\'m confused as to who exactly you think the Koch brothers are, and how you\'re so uninformed as to what they do, who they\'ve bought, how much power they wield, and as to how *anyone* has managed to just ignore the back and forth between Fox news and the White House. Fox doesn\'t have to be *literal" state propaganda (as in Trump is telling them what to air) to fulfill the *function*. So sure, maybe it is a bit dramatic to *call* it that, but it\'s absolutely SPOT FUCKING ON POINT when it comes to how the conservative propaganda machine works. \n\nI\'d say it\'s more fair to say that the Koch brothers are telling both the Trump administration *and* Fox news what to do. It\'s just a silent coup, no big deal, no need to dramatize it by calling it "state propaganda", it\'s easier and more accurate to call it a "state takeover by private elite citizens".\n\n----------\n\nSo while you\'re either a paid provocateur, an ignorant rube, or a delusional sycophant (and I say those as clinical descriptions of behavior, not pejoratives), I urge you to consider the counterarguments to your position - if you\'re so correct, your idea should stand up to self-scrutiny in the light of full information, shouldn\'t they?\n\n-----------\n\nEdit; one last thing, you used the word "reign" to describe Obama\'s presidency. This isn\'t a monarchy.'

'You\'re welcome.\n\nNo, hiring an opposition research firm to do opposition research is not "collusion", it\'s opposition research. It\'s perfectly legal and ethical, and at the presidential level, you\'d have to be out of your mind not to do it. If those questions lead you to Russia, they lead you to Russia. On the other hand, being approached by Russian agents to receive stolen emails, and agreeing to the meeting, may well be a criminal conspiracy.\n\nUsing evidence to show probable cause to get a FISA warrant is also neither illegal nor unethical, if that evidence was legally obtained.'

The entire process has oversight from US agencies, as well as the IAEA, and good luck getting it out of the country if you steal it. Nothing is being sold - that would be public record, and doesn\'t exist.\n\nThat is what a fact looks like. Primary-source documentation of that can be presented in court.\n\n**The deal itself was overseen by a Republican Congress, which had the power to legislate otherwise** *at any time* from then until now to prevent or stop this. Most of them are the same then as now. If your claim was accurate, they\'d be complicit. Also, Russia would simultaneously be the bad guy taking the uranium and the good guy we can trust to partner our cybersecurity with, which doesn\'t make *any* sense.\n\n-------------\n\nAs an aside, because you don\'t seem to understand anything you\'re talking about:\n\nThe Clinton Foundation is a charitable non-profit, which means they can\'t touch that money.... unless they\'re taking a page out of Trump\'s book and using it as a slush fund, in which case, sure, prosecute them. ^(spoiler: they\'re not, Congress has looked into it several times already, but refuses to look at Trump for some strange reason)\n\nAnything Bill did around shady speeches is probably worth looking into.

'This came from the WSJ, owned by Rupert "Fox" Murdoch.  The publication is ridiculously pro-Trump.  Their editorial board even suggested recently that Mueller be fired - that\'s how defensive they are of their man in the Oval Office.  \n\nWhy would they print this?  To detract from the controversy surrounding "shithole"?  Not likely.  Trump\'s base is firmly behind the comment as they feel the same way.  Apparently, Trump is enjoying the controversy he generated as well.  \n\nI think the reason why WSJ is printing this is because they have a great scoop and they believe it to be true.  While they do support Trump, WSJ also knows that a scoop like this sells subscriptions.  And if they believe this to be true about a person they wildly support, they must have a shitload of evidence to suggest this is true.  \n\nI hope this story has legs.  '

She ended up winning the case.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/11/16/church-flying-spaghetti-monster-massachusetts-religion/75862946/) Between something like that and [The Church of Scientology being recognized as an official religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology_status_by_country), how does this MAGA guy differ? \n\nPeople wear political clothing all the time, which in my opinion is generally a good thing. Before the election I saw more Hillary and Bernie shirts than any other politician I've ever seen. Would it still be okay to kick all those people out of whatever establishment they wanted to go in? I'm a big Bernie guy, if my employer found out and happened to be a Trump supporter could I be fired? \n\nTo me, this sets a dangerous precedent going forward and is more harmful than helpful. \n\n"
'I mean ... I kind of agree with the guy.\n\n>Religions are shared collections of transcendental beliefs that have been passed on from believers to converts, that are held by adherents to be actively meaningful and serious and either based on (1) formally documented doctrine (organized religion) or (2) established cultural practices (folk religion). In both forms, there are religious professionals who embody formal aspects of the religion and who act in positions of leadership and governance, and there are certain rituals reserved for them to carry out. The beliefs generate practical implications for how life should be lived.\n\n>Religions often include: spiritual explanations of our place in the world in an attempt to answer questions about "why we are here"; worship of deities and/or supernatural entities (including ancestors); conceptions of "holy" and "sacred" activities ideas and objects; set rituals, calendar events based on the changing seasons, distinctive dress codes (especially for religious professionals), codes of morality and action that are given a mandate from a supernaturally great being, from a supernatural force or from the will of the Universe itself; and, a caste of privileged and exalted professionals who have particular claims to be in touch with transcendental forces.\n\nEDIT:  Downvotes without response?  Look, I am one of you.  Donald has to go.  His followers are absurd.  However, there is a larger discussion to be had about what *is* and *is not* a religion.  '
'(Not a lawyer.)  \n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe law differs on whether it is a private business or a government entity. (The government is basically not allowed to do this because of the constitution - freedom of speech/assemble.  \n&nbsp;\n\nThe legal term for treating people differently is to "discriminate".  It\'s a negative term when associated with racism/sexism/etc, but it just describes differences in treatment. An employer discriminates when he gives one employee a raise for stellar work and doesn\'t give that raise to everyone. A business discriminates when giving lunch specials or volume pricing.  \n&nbsp;\n\nWith a private business (or an individual person), they have the right to treat different people differently  for any reason provided they aren\'t doing it based on one of several "protected classes" - e.g race, religion, sex and others. (Some classes are only protected on a State level by individual State laws- sexual orientation is the most visible one.)  \n&nbsp;\n\nPolitical party or political beliefs are not protected classes.  \n&nbsp;\n\n\nEmployers can fire people for their political beliefs (at least in most areas as would be "at will" employees).  \n&nbsp;  \n\nThe precedent is not being set here. It is long established. There is a balance between infringing on the behavior of individuals and businesses and protecting the rights of people being excluded for the political beliefs. If this became a significant problem, the state/federal solution would be to create political belief to be a protected class (as was done for race, sex and religion). Given that this isn\'t a routine or widespread issue, that isn\'t about to happen.   \n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe counter argument would be - would you want to prohibit a Jewish owned restaurant from being able to kick out a group of customers in full Nazi regalia?  Does a Trump Hotel have the legal right to refuse Stormy Daniel from doing a press conference from a hotel ballroom if she wants to rent it for the day? Can a landscaper refuse to take the job to tend the grounds of the KKK headquarters?'
'Black people are a protected class, Trump supporters are not. '
'I don\'t know if that\'s fair, because even though it appears to us that the majority of his supporters suffer most in relation to his policy decisions while being sold on the idea they\'re being helped, I don\'t think calling it a cult is constructive. \n\nAlso, "one person\'s freedom fighter is another\'s terrorist" sort of idea applies to the hate group aspect. I think that the best approach is to empathise, seek to understand, and respect them as fellow human beings. I think that the best way to approach someone\'s *faith* without encroaching is to be loving towards them. That doesn\'t entail skirting around topics or tip toeing, it just means not labelling them, leveling with them as a human, not categorizing or disregarding them as being part of a cult or hate group, that will only incite an emotional/ego based kneejerk reactionary response based on their association with those two terms.\n\nI believe that both cults and hate groups are born from the same emotion: **fear**'
'>... if it included anything that a sufficient number of people were especially enthusiastic about.\n\nI don\'t think that is the case here, because to me it seems like many of whom I\'ve encountered are re-allocating *faith* to him. Their support of him typically is rooted in that, which is hard to argue with, and quickly devolves into name-calling and general breaks in communication. \n\nI agree with you, as do many scholars on the legal definition of "religion" but it\'s been evolving ever since that amendment was put on paper. Check out "Defining Religion in the First Amendment: a Functional Approach" from Cornell University. I just read through it, pretty interesting. \n\nThe conclusion is distinctly different from Trump support, but I wanted to offer my perspective to show how this person might think of it like a religion.  The main difference in my opinion being that belief in him is not existential to the self, but to the ego.'
"Black people could theoretically support David Duke, but they can not un-choose their blackness. \n\nSo yes it's totally ok to bar someone for their political support, but it's not ok to bar someone for who or what they are"
'To many at this point the MAGA hat is representative of some pretty repulsive viewpoints. Those that wear them are usually doing it for the same reason someone might wear a shirt that says "fuck you you fucking fuck" but worse because the underlying message is deeper.\n\nIt\'s kind of like when Richard Spencer attempts to soften public perceptions of NAZI/KKK ideology by changing the labeling involved, the looks involved, even the language involved in order to penetrate the mainstream and draw support or influence the easily influenced. \n\nI\'m not saying all people who wear MAGA hats are white nationalists seeking an ethno-state for whites only but they do share a common thread with those people and don\'t make any attempts to distance themselves from it and that is pretty telling.'

The Democrats will likely (if they don\'t fuck things up too hard) win a majority in the 2018 elections and then vote to impeach. \n\nI think the reason the GOP is ramming their "fuck everyone but the rich" tax bill through so quickly is because they suspect they won\'t keep their majority for very long. Soon they won\'t be able to pass anything and they will go back to being the obstructionist opposition party. \n\nThe real question is whether the Democrats can use Trump\'s unpopularity and the GOP\'s moral bankruptcy to peel off enough GOP voters to enable them to take and hold a majority in the House and Senate.

'Robert Swan Mueller III (born August 7, 1944) is an American lawyer and civil servant who was the sixth Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 2001 to 2013. A Republican, he was appointed by President George W. Bush and his original ten-year term was given a two-year extension by President Barack Obama, making him the longest-serving FBI director since J. Edgar Hoover. He is currently head of the Special Counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.'
"I told people before the election that trump was going to win. Nobody in my circle believed it was possible. In fact most people (including trump) thought he was going to lose. I think the people in this sub are guilty of idealistic wishful thinking that is completely divorced from the reality of modern politics. Trumps opponents are totally ineffectual against what he is and what he represents. I want more than anything to be wrong about these things but I doubt things are going to get much better anytime soon. Trump will most likely be reelected in 2020. It's time to wake up to reality. If we want things to change we have to hope for the best BUT prepare for the worst."

Their faith blinds them to the opinions like Trump is supporting the Evangelicals, I am evangelical.   Therefore Trump = Good, because he is forwarding my most important priority, GOD.   Trust me, the whole Christian faith is an apocalyptic faith.  They literally believe jeebus is coming back for them for the magical ascendance into cloudy paradise.   They view the world as ecumenical and for the use of man to reach paradise.

'If Trump wins it will be because the GOP is actively working to limit voting rights and reduce the number of people who vote.'
'**Evangelicalism**\n\nEvangelicalism (), evangelical Christianity, or evangelical Protestantism, is a worldwide, crossdenominational movement within Protestant Christianity which maintains the belief that the essence of the Gospel consists of the doctrine of salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ\'s atonement. Evangelicals believe in the centrality of the conversion or the "born again" experience in receiving salvation, in the authority of the Bible as God\'s revelation to humanity, and in spreading the Christian message. The movement has had a long presence in the Anglosphere before spreading further afield in the 19th, 20th and early 21st centuries.\n\nIts origins are usually traced to 1738, with various theological streams contributing to its foundation, including English Methodism, the Moravian Church (in particular its bishop Nicolaus Zinzendorf and his community at Herrnhut), and German Lutheran Pietism.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

That is anything from discriminating against homosexuals to blue laws like not selling alcohol while Sunday Mass is happening.  To them freedom means, "you are free to be exactly how I want you to be."  THAT makes a group assholes!\n\nSecondly, they hold a distorted, and growing currently, sense of humanity insofar as it being evil.  The math works as follows:\n\nA family has a loving grandfather who is diagnosed with Stage 3 Cancer of some form.  He is healed of his condition.  \n\nThe family MEANS WELL, they hold good intention when they thank their god privately and publicly.  They mean no harm and are just genuinely thankful to their god.  \n\nThey also mean no harm when they do little to nothing to publicly thank the doctors and nurses who performed the surgery and administered care.  Meant no harm when they failed to thank publicly the many thousands, possibly millions of accumulated hours of research that went into finding treatments and cures for only that particular form of cancer.  Meant zero harm when they failed to thank the labor that went into constructing, managing, and directing the institutions that gave care and performed research. \n\nThey gave, publicly, all the praise and thanks to their god. \n\nThat would be alright!  However, they don\'t hate their god when things go wrong.  Instead they hate mankind. \n\nSo their worldview grows distorted when they thank their god where others can hear it for all the good we see, and then blame man for all the bad we see without at least a proportional amount of good we see credited to mankind as well. \n\nNothing accomplishes this better than a congregation of people, meaning no harm, doing this over and over; a church. \n\nThis is a truly evil philosophy.  It\'s manipulative.  It lifts up the church when it did nothing without lifting up those institutions which did everything.  "To God give all the glory" is detrimental to mankind for the sake of the church, the same church that demands you practice this. \n\nThe Church has managed to find a way to take all of the praise, without all of the pomp and stance, by gaining it vicariously through a book it chooses too. \n\nSo evil...'

'**Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections**\n\nThe Russian government interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election in order to increase political instability in the United States and to damage Hillary Clinton\'s presidential campaign by bolstering the candidacies of Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein. A January 2017 assessment by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) stated that Russian leadership favored presidential candidate Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, and that Russian president Vladimir Putin personally ordered an "influence campaign" to harm Clinton\'s electoral chances and "undermine public faith in the US democratic process."On October 7, 2016, the ODNI and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) jointly stated that the U.S. Intelligence Community was confident that the Russian Government directed recent hacking of e-mails with the intention of interfering with the U.S. election process. According to the ODNI′s January 6, 2017 report, the Russian military intelligence service (GRU) had hacked the servers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the personal Google email account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and forwarded their contents to WikiLeaks. Although Russian officials have repeatedly denied involvement in any DNC hacks or leaks, there is strong forensic evidence linking the DNC breach to known Russian operations.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

But, affordable healthcare and college does.  However, it will affect my day to day life in the future if we allow this level of corruption to continue.

'"Microtargeting" of content is really interesting. Because [Robert Mercer](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/27/the-reclusive-hedge-fund-tycoon-behind-the-trump-presidency), the billionaire hedgefund guy behind Trump, is the main investor in Cambridge Analytica - a company that specializes in exactly that. It\'s parent company is [SCL Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica) (Strategic Communication Laboratories) which has been described as a "global election management agency" known for involvement "in military disinformation campaigns to social media branding and voter targeting". In short, **they specialize in military propaganda or ‘psyops’**. \n\n*Cambridge Analytica* was brought in by Mercer to help Trump win. \n\n>Cambridge Analytica:  The company claims to use “data enhancement and audience segmentation techniques” providing “psychographic analysis” for a “deeper knowledge of the target audience”. The company uses the OCEAN scale of personality traits. Using what it calls **"behavioral microtargeting"** the company indicates that it can predict "needs" of subjects and how these needs may change over time. Services then can be individually targeted for the benefit of its clients from the political arena, governments, and companies providing "a better and more actionable view of their key audiences." \n\nCombining data and content obtained through nefarious means (hacking) with sophisticated software and targeting to maximize its effectiveness is evil genius. All the pieces are coming together now. What is becoming much clearer now is that Trump\'s victory was no bumbling accident. \n\nInterestingly, Cambridge Analytica\'s software is based on models developed by Cambridge academic Michal Kosinski - he didn\'t want to have anything to do with the company. The guy that first approached Kosinski was Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian. It was Kogan that apparently introduced SCL to Kosinki\'s models. Kogan then moved to Singapore and changed his name to [Alexander Spectre](http://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/people/ak823@cam.ac.uk). Was he working for Russian Intelligence? **Given the key role Cambridge Analytica and SCL played in the US election (and in Brexit), it would be good to know who exactly is behind them.** \n\n> Who exactly owns SCL and its diverse branches is unclear, thanks to a convoluted corporate structure, the type seen in the UK Companies House, the Panama Papers, and the Delaware company registry. Some of the SCL offshoots have been involved in elections from Ukraine to Nigeria, helped the Nepalese monarch against the rebels, whereas others have developed methods to influence Eastern European and Afghan citizens for NATO. And, in 2013, SCL spun off a new company to participate in US elections: Cambridge Analytica.\n\nIt gets more interesting. The largest shareholder of SCL was on record as being Vincent Tchenguiz, an Iranian-British businessman.  Tchenguiz is a business partner with Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash,  who is known as a Putin protégé. Tchenguiz used the same Guernsey holding company, Wheddon Ltd., to invest both in Cambridge Analytica’s parent company and in another privately held U.K. business whose largest shareholder was the Ukrainian gas middleman [Dmitry Firtash](http://www.reuters.com/article/russia-capitalism-gas-special-report-pix-idUSL3N0TF4QD20141126) - a close friend of Putin who is [currently indicted](http://abc7chicago.com/news/ukrainian-oligarchs-extradition-to-chicago-on-hold/1768041/) and awaiting extradition on corruption and racketeering charges.\n\n> Over the same time period, other documents show, bankers close to Putin granted Firtash credit lines of up to $11 billion. That credit helped Firtash, who backed pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovich\'s successful 2010 bid to become Ukraine\'s president, to buy a dominant position in the country\'s chemical and fertiliser industry and expand his influence.\n\nAnd guess who was Dmitry Firtash\'s former business partner? [Paul Manafort](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-campaign-chief-paul-manafort-named-in-ukraine-anti-corruption-probe/2016/08/15/fa180f20-6327-11e6-be4e-23fc4d4d12b4_story.html) - Trump\'s former campaign manager. Manafort of course worked directly for Yanukovych and [Firtash](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/21/austria-grants-us-request-to-extradite-ukrainian-mogul-dmytro-firtash) was the middleman between Putin and the Yanukovych electoral operation in Ukraine.\n\nSo the largest shareholder of Cambridge Analytica is a business partner with Firtash, who has direct ties with Putin. Firtash is known to operate as a financing middleman for Putin\'s foreign policy "operations". Could SCL, parent of CA, be a front for a Russian Intelligence operation? If you think about it, SCL specializes in new sophisticated technology models for military propaganda. If you read up on new Russian military doctrine, it\'s clear they are placing a big emphasis on information warfare. The [\'Gerasimov Doctrine’](https://inmoscowsshadows.wordpress.com/2014/07/06/the-gerasimov-doctrine-and-russian-non-linear-war/) is quite insightful about how Russia views defeating their enemies:\n\n> The role of nonmilitary means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown, and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their effectiveness....All this is supplemented by military means of a concealed character, including carrying out actions of informational conflict.\n\n> Among such actions are the use of special-operations forces and *internal opposition* to create a permanently operating front through the entire territory of the enemy state, as well as informational actions, devices, and means that are constantly being perfected.\n\nDid Russia view Bannon/Trump and co as the perfect vehicles to ferment and support "internal opposition"? Was Cambridge Analytica one of the vehicles to achieve this and to help execute their ideas around information warfare?\n\nGuess who a Board Member of Cambridge Analytica was? **Steve Bannon.** And it was Robert Mercer that [bankrolled Steve Bannon](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/robert-mercer-breitbart-war-on-media-steve-bannon-donald-trump-nigel-farage) and Breitbart to the tune of $10 million - no doubt to be the front-facing tool to execute on their ideas around influence, manipulation and propaganda. \n\nAnd with the help of Russian Intelligence, it is entirely plausible Breitbart was involved in using bots and social media to help propagate news they knew would damage Hillary and help Trump. \n\nThere are very clear and direct ties between powerful Russian/Ukrainian figures and Cambridge Analytica - which specializes in military propaganda. Steve Bannon was a board member and Robert Mercer was its biggest investor. And of course Mercer, Banner, Cambridge Analytica and Brieitbart all played a key roll in helping Trump get elected. It\'s not a big stretch to suggest that there was cooperation and collusion with Russian Intelligence, who provided hacked data to Cambridge Analytica, who then used it to carry out a sophisticated propaganda campaign, with Breitbart as the lead. \n\n[Cambridge Analytica also played a key role in BREXIT - offering Firage and the Leave campaign their services *for free*](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/robert-mercer-brexit-nigel-farage-donald-trump-breitbart-facebook-advertisement-cambridge-analytica-a7600041.html). \n\n>The firm is said to have advised Leave.eu by harvesting data from people\'s Facebook profiles to decide how to target them with individualised advertisements.  \n\n\nBrexit was of course seen as a big geopolitical strategic win for Putin and Russia.\n\nAnother interesting bit of info that is a bit tenuous but nonetheless intriguing - the largest shareholder of SCL Group was Vincent Tchenguiz. \n\n> In March 2011 the Tchenguiz brothers were arrested in dramatic predawn raids as part of an investigation into the 2008 collapse of the Icelandic bank Kaupthing. Just before its collapse, Kaupthing’s loans to the Tchenguiz brothers totaled 40 percent of its capital. It has been charged that Kaupthing—which had a far-from-transparent ownership structure—was effectively the Tchenguiz brothers’ bank and that they looted the bank, leading to its collapse.\n\n> Kaupthing’s largest shareholder, Meidur, now called Exista, which owned 25 percent of its shares, [had ties to Alfa Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exista), the largest Russian commercial bank; Alfa chairman was “deep state” figure Mikhail Fridman, chairman and co-founder of Alfa Group, the parent of Alfa Bank. Meanwhile, Trump adviser Richard Burt (who also was being paid by Russia to promote a Gazprom pipeline) is on the “senior advisory board” of Alfa Bank. \n\nWas this how Russian intelligence bankrolled SCL in the early days? Perhaps Vincent Tchenguiz was the cutout man, and funds were channeled from Alfa Bank into Kaupthing and on to Vincent Tchenguiz. Russian Intelligence seems to work well with ambitious businessman who are happy to be corrupted if they can make some money. Trump also seemed to fit this bill. \n\n*Alfa Bank was the bank that a Trump Server was mysteriously communicating with and was likely the subject of an FBI surveillance warrant.*  '
'It\'s important to understand the specific nature of legal wording/phrasing.\n\nWhere the language of a Mueller indictment might say the "voting outcome" was not affected by the hacks is to say that the hackers did not alter voting records. This is correct.\n\nHowever, this purposely doesn\'t comment on the indirect effect that entities, including but not limited to the GRU, had on influencing the actual voting outcome.\n\nThere are several reasons to make this distinction, but the legal reason for it is to avoid hanging a legal argument on tenuous threads.  Each of Mueller\'s indictments is compartmented, narrow, specific.... so as to increase the likelihood of securing the Grand Jury conviction.  The FBI has a near 100&#37; conviction rate and they like to keep it that way.  And to that point, the charges made are Conspiracy to Defraud the U.S. (18 USC §371), computer fraud (18 USC §1030), and aggravated identity theft (18 USC §1028A).\n\nAnother consideration reinforced by the legal analysts at Lawfareblog: There is almost no likelihood of extradition for the 12 GRU officers... they will never leave Russia or be extradited by Russia to the U.S.  So, the purpose of the indictment, other than laying groundwork for other indictments and freezing Russian assets in the United States, is to let the American people know.  And in that sense, every word or phrase is chosen carefully.\n\nThe indictment clearly tells us that the vote counts were not changed (which is, again, completely correct), but it clearly excludes any kind of conclusion that the actual votes made were not *influenced*... that was the entire intent of the Russian effort from paragraph one of the indictment.'
'**Cambridge Analytica**\n\nCambridge Analytica Ltd (CA) was a British political consulting firm which combined data mining, data brokerage, and data analysis with strategic communication during the electoral processes. It was started in 2013 as an offshoot of the SCL Group. The company was partly owned by the family of Robert Mercer, an American hedge-fund manager who supports many politically conservative causes. The firm maintained offices in London, New York City, and Washington, DC. CEO Alexander Nix has said CA was involved in 44 US political races in 2014.\n\n***\n\n**Exista**\n\nExista hf. is an Icelandic financial services group formerly listed on the Iceland Stock Exchange.

They must have been requesting information during that time beyond just negotiating for an interview.

"This seems calculated (in as much as anything can be calculated with Trump). If he claims Cohen didn't represent him in the Daniels stuff, then attorney-client privilege wouldn't apply to any of that material.

'There must be a motivating factor for Trump to do this after denying it from the start and it is really fun to speculate.  Trump\'s denial of this made no sense from the start but he still proceeded to deny anyway, so what changed?\n\nTo Trump, he likely finds it plausible to deny while acting differently in the courts.  Then he can simply call "FAKE NEWS, MAGA" on any who reports on it.  After denying the affair and by inference he denied the possibility that Stormy Daniels could have any material to to prove this \\- he entered as a damaged party regarding the NDA that Stormy "breached" meaning that there is an admission that at a minimum the facts as stated in the NDA \\(including that Stormy has materials and proof\\) are in fact true and "DD" is indeed Trump.  All the while he still calls it fake news when anyone reports this.\n\nTo have this shift and to publicly claim otherwise in the public \\- something unexpected and very motivating must be in play.  \n\nThe best guess floating around it seems is that it relates to Cohen\'s legal troubles in his criminal suit.  Remember, Cohen claimed to only have a few clients he does "legal work" for.  Cohen is arguing for documents to remain under the protection of client/attorney privilege and that there is a ton of documents that are privileged.  \n\nYet, two of the three clients he claimed to do legal work for have been claiming Cohen barely did any actual legal work for them basically throwing Cohen under a large bus .  How could there be a ton of legal documents that should be protected when 2 out of 3 clients claim that there was basically a minimal amount of legal services from Cohen being provided? \n\nTrump may be trying to assert to the court that Cohen indeed was representing him legally and trying to make the point that indeed there are protected documents \\(if Trump claimed Cohen did nothing legally for him, then Cohen can\'t make a claim of attorney/client privilege\\).  Alternatively, Trump could be doing this in order to stay on Cohen\'s good side.  Who knows how loyal Cohen will be when/if the chips fall?  This could be a self preservation move to help Cohen and in turn hopefully keep his loyalty.'

I'm not sure on the legalities of that, but he's a slightly below average intelligence, wannabe goon, so he might hunk that's his last angle.  \n  Honestly, who fucking knows anymore, right? 18 months ago I'd have laughed at myself for even thinking something like this is possible.

There was little doubt in his mind that he could bring in people to cover his back, like Sen Sessions, who unlike Trump was elected to office and knew the routine.

"On the other hand, here in the Netherlands we have many parties representing us. It is not hard to find a party which you support, but the impact is marginal. We have 150 seats and need 76 seats atleast to have a coalition. The problem is, when you have many parties, it may require 2 parties to achieve a coalition of 76+ seats (like we had previously) or now 4 parties.\n\nThe problem? Well, the combination involves four different parties with different views. They all have to make so many comprimises that it didn't really mattet after all who you voted for, as the end result is just a comprised bunch of ideas that are just an average and doesn't result in any real actions. Very little changes and it takes a while for something to change.\n\nBottom line: sure, it is not good to have so little options. But although it might be better to have more options to choose from, it is not the ideal situation. We need to rethink the way our political system is shaped. Have a look at Switzerland for example, where many refenderums are taken and the politicians have a supporting role (i.e. implementing the results of the refenderums) instead of a representative role. There are many forms and there may not be a perfect solution that fits each country, but the current state of the system is not sustainable."

'If the article is true, and it appears to be true because Don Jr. just tweeted out complete confirmation of everything (again), then this is one of the many smoking guns that are laying around in the Trump/Russia thing.  This proves that the Trump family was coordinating activities with a hostile foreign intelligence service aligned with Russia.  If this is the kind of evidence that Mueller has (it is), then a pretty strong case can be made for crimes such as Conspiracy Against The United States.  Also, from the beginning of all of this, the Intelligence Community has called the Trump/Russia thing "an **ATTACK** on our election".  This is very important, because if the American government perceives this as an act of war (it does), then any Americans that were knowingly involved in that have committed Treason.  So now we apparently have proof that the Trump family has conspired with a foreign power to commit an act of war against the United States.  Nearly the entire Trump family now has to answer for Treason.  At least, that\'s my interpretation of the facts.  Better buckle up and invest in popcorn.'

In fact, on many non-partisan issues their factual coverage (where they do cover a topic) is more expansive, although tinged with conservative rhetoric. [They were the first outlet covering the recent release of an American from Venezuelan prison to describe his charges and explain why the charges were allegedly false](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/05/26/trump-says-utah-man-in-venezuelan-jail-to-be-released.html).\n\nThe issue isn\'t with the content per se, but with the desire not to be told what to believe or what to do by people with more expertise than you, which is the exact job of a professional press. The anti-elite sentiment drives a desire for sensationalized press, and that populism is why outlets like the Wall Street Journal, which does great reporting from a conservative perspective, are labelled "MSM" rather than being accepted as "conservative media."'

I assume you mean Kilimnik, a *former* Russian intelligence agent, at a time when all Russian men were required to serve in the military.  Kilimnik denies he is involved with Russian intelligence currently, and there is (once again) **zero public evidence** that this is not true.  Maybe he\'s clean, maybe he\'s Putin\'s right hand man.\n\nIf he is working directly for Putin, their relationship is clearly a coincidence with Trump.  There\'s no way in 2005 anyone would have predicted Trump would run for President, much less choose Manafort for a campaign chairman.\n\nWe know about Kilimnik, because Gates gave that information to Mueller.

According to a Reuters report, Tony Podesta was “among the high-profile lobbyists registered to represent organizations backing Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich.” Among these was the European Center, which paid Podesta $900,000 for his lobbying.

Schiff has said he was not really fooled by the call.\n\n>The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner (D-Va.), had extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch to help connect with the author of the anti-Trump “dossier.” Warner reportedly texted at the time that he didn’t wish to “leave a paper trail.” Warner allegedly waited six months before disclosing the contacts to the committee, which is investigating Russia matters. \n\n>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Hillary Clinton campaign funded the anti-Trump “dossier” that relied on Russian sources, who were close to Kremlin officials.\n\nSeems like they can become campaign chairmen for the Clintons.  Oh, you say the dealings with those Russians weren\'t Russian intelligence?

I also don't think undergrad school = your IQ. (IQ is also socially determined, is a biased criteria \nJust using as short hand for intelligence as flawed as it is) People from privileged backgrounds are accepted at a much higher rate into higher ranked universities-- education levels of parents, access to best k-12 schools, all the other privileges of being wealthy, and being white are still huge advantages in life in the US today. In Trump's time, it was even more so... I know someone who is slightly younger than Trump who went to Princeton, he has commented that before his time, it was even harder to get into Princeton being Jewish ... can you imagine how hard in the 60s being a poor minority from a crappy inner city school would have been to get into UPenn in comparison to Trump? Bush, president 43, is the same age as Trump and went to Yale...proving again my point.\n  \nSorry-not sorry but Trump's elitism about education and hypocrisy about ignoring Fordham gets my goat.

"As someone who actually transferred schools, let me assure you its not the same application process, or the same level of competition from other students.

When the NSDAP was created, they released a 25-point program that did include many stipulations and demands that were recognized as socialist, including state ownership of land (point 17) and redistribution of capital (point 14).\n\n>***The Nazis then proceeded to enact precisely none of those policies when they had control of the government.*** All the socialist demands dropped off completely and the nationalist ones became the party platform - the part about citizenship being restricted to the German race (read: not Jews) and demands of land/territory for expansion (Lebensraum).\n\n> There was a wing of the Nazi party that did actually take the "socialism" part of their name seriously and tried to recruit the same working class young people that the communists did. The Strasser brothers (Gregor and Otto) were the most important leaders of this "left wing" of the party, and Roehm was in there as well. The Nazis also worked with the communists in the Berlin transit strike.\n\n>However, ***Hitler himself was definitely in the "conservative wing" of the party and he obviously won***. One of the Strassers was murdered in 1934 as Hitler purged the party of its left wing. The main Nazis who emerged in power, with the exception of Goebbels, who switched from the Strasser faction to Hitler, didn\'t have any attachment to socialism whatsoever and worked hand-in-hand with big business.\n'
'**It Can\'t Happen Here**\n\nIt Can\'t Happen Here is a semi-satirical 1935 political novel by American author Sinclair Lewis, and a 1936 play adapted from the novel by Lewis and John C. Moffitt.\n\nPublished during the rise of fascism in Europe, the novel describes the rise of Berzelius "Buzz" Windrip, a politician who defeats Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) and is elected President of the United States, after fomenting fear and promising drastic economic and social reforms while promoting a return to patriotism and "traditional" values. After his election, Windrip takes complete control of the government and imposes a plutocratic/totalitarian rule with the help of a ruthless paramilitary force, in the manner of Adolf Hitler and the SS. The novel\'s plot centers on journalist Doremus Jessup\'s opposition to the new regime and his subsequent struggle against it as part of a liberal rebellion.\n\nReviewers at the time, and literary critics ever since, have emphasized the connection with Louisiana politician Huey Long, who was preparing to run for president in the 1936 election when he was assassinated in 1935 just prior to the novel\'s publication.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

'It is more than that, Amazon is a company that exist on not a very large profit margin. It is a company made to last, partly due to the time that Amazon came out.\n\nTrump has attached his pride to this wealth, so to see someone who is not make the same profits being successful. It eats him alive to feel like he has fallen from the public eye while someone like him has a fortune and a future. \n\nTrump seems to lost a lot of his fortune and is swiftly running out of a future.'
'From the article:\n\n"While the USPS has for years been losing money, including a $2.7 billion net loss for the 2017 fiscal year, **package delivery is one of the few bright spots.**"  \n\n“That’s actually the solution right now,” former Postmaster General Jack Potter told The Wall Street Journal. “It’s well justified that they deliver those packages, and **they make money on it**.”\n'

"Well there could be grounds for appeal but he's not doing this in a court room, he's doing it on Fox and Friends. "
"That's not a fair comment at all. There are a LOT of intelligent republicans. I know an absolute ton of them. However, most of them are wealthy enough that they support Republicans to protect their assets. They don't typically care (at least not as passionately) about the Republican positions on things like abortion or gay marriage. \n\nUnfortunately, the larger part of the Republican party are those who've been bamboozled into it by the promise of pushing their moral directives. They vote against their own economic, health, and other interests in the hopes that by vilifying the opposing position, they'll eventually get their 1-2 core issues legislated, and they do so completely oblivious to the reality that they're pawns for politicians who honestly don't remotely care about those issues, and often are the largest violator of those morals.\n"
'Most of the smart republicans I know swallowed their pride and voted Clinton, or else "threw their vote away for Evan McMullin or Gary Johnson, because they saw Trump for what he is. Very few have ever been on the Trump train or even tepidly supportive of him. \n\nAnd no, these are not independents. Most have voted straight ticket Republican for decades, still hesitate to criticize anything about Bush\'s presidency, etc. Several were delagates in the Republican primary (my state went heavily to Cruz, something like 70%). '
"The problem is we don't have a viable third (or fourth) party. If your primary interests are economic, you vote Republican. Many of them would probably be Libertarian if it were viable. Others would totally jump on a fiscally conservative/socially liberal or moderate platform.\n\nI totally get what you're saying though. I've had conversations with many of the smart Republicans I know, and they either use mental gymnastics to convince themselves that charity can fill the voids created by Republican policies, or they believe we should fund the social net by reducing the military (obviously dissenting from the R platform on this issue). However, they still feel more strongly about low taxes, lower regulation on their businesses, etc. \n\n"
"Absolutely. Trump was within his legal rights to fire Comey. His motivation is what would make it obstruction. Same thing applies if he were to fire Rosenstein in order to effect the dissolution of the probe. It's legal for him to do so, but the legal act may become obstruction of justice based on his motives."

'[The NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/us/politics/questions-mueller-wants-to-ask-trump-russia.html) specifically says "recently provided President Trump’s lawyers a list of questions he wants answered in an interview" and they got a copy, but "they are not quoted verbatim, and some were condensed."\n\nI don\'t think this jives with what CNN is reporting.  "Extrapolating from topics discussed with the special counsel" is not the same as "recently provided President Trump’s lawyers a list of questions".\n\n(I\'m not saying the leak didn\'t come from Trump\'s team, mind you.)'
'Although at the point they question Trump \\(if ever\\) the investigators will have \\(via months of  interviews, grand jury testimony and evidence collection\\) have a good bead on exactly the story of the case. That is why they will wait to question Trump last.'
"Pretty sure you don't actually understand the concept behind evidence..."

"Interesting stuff! In the UK we don't have a written constitution, so our rights come from an accumulation of years of precedence, custom, and acts of parliament. I think there's equivalent rights over here but it's not as specifically enumerated as in the 5th amendment. There's waning and waxing enthusiasm for a proper bill of rights but nothing has come of it, because by and large we feel that we value being able to change the law as time dictates without having to make it a massive deal (like amending the Constitution is in the US).\n\nIs the 5th amendment a thing that has had its day, do you think? An anomaly that no longer serves its purpose (as it seems to be a bit of a non-starter from my point of view) or is it a vital part of the framework? If the constitution was written today, would it still be in there?\n\nBeyond the scope of the original post I know but I'm curious."

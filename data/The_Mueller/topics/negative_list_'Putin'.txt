Trump actually wrote this: "Putin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded.." Impeach this traitor.
Donald Trump Has Now Met With Vladimir Putin Four Times, Has Visited U.S. Troops In Combat Zones Zero Times
Trump must be removed for 'treasonous conduct' with Putin, former White House ethics chief says
Ted Lieu (Member of Congress): "The Kremlin committed mass murder with the downing of the civilian airliner. Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia interfered in American elections. Now Trump wants to reinstate Russia to G-7. What exactly does Putin have on Trump?"
'Can you imagine what a stone cold killer like Putin thinks of Trump? He must go to sleep every night laughing at how easily he’s managed to completely and utterly fuck the US. '
"I think Mueller should take the Trump lawyers' 60 day challenge proposal.  Imagine 8 more infrastructure weeks for this failing administration."
'NO COLLUSION!'
'Thought this was a recent letter. Too bad this means nothing. '
'This is starting to piss me off.'
'No kidding! This must feel like an intro course back in spy school for Putin. "Intro to Manipulation 102"'
'Big, loopy handwriting, the dot on every "i" is replaced with a small heart, LOTS of CAPITAL LETTERS and EXCLAMATION POINTS!!!!!\n\nThere was also some nonsense in there about being the PeNguIn of DoOm and holding up a spork but I didn\'t read it.'
"I don't like how Ivanka apparently  gets away and is happy...."
'No u dont'
"Is it helpful to be able to ignore all context and focus in on one thing? I can't imagine it helps in any work environment."
'Nooooo Not the penguin of doom'
'What the fuck? Is this source reliable?'
'Really, we needed to be told this the entire trip was at the behest of Putin and Xi. He loves dictators, hates democracy’s complicated checks and balances.  He the epitome of how a society is sucked into the cult of personality. '
'I knew Putin played a role in this. I said it weeks ago and I was called a conspiracy nut. Trump doesn’t do anything without daddy Putin pulling the strings. '
'Was that ever in doubt? '
"Allegedly. There's no source, could be anyone."
'The article has a pretty glaring typo. It says Trump got the idea from an "unusual source" instead of that he got it from "his usual source". The editor should be disappointed that he missed that.'
'Jesus you guys are deluded\n\nHeadline was already grasping at straws so you modified it to make it sound like a statement of fact\n\nThere are a million and a half legitimate things to go after Trump for and you always pick the dumbest ones'
'ITT: Neo-conservitive, and neo-liberal warmongeting fucks. /t'
'"joked"... Nah boo, he wasn\'t joking, but was later informed that it\'s illegal. He\'s gonna need to change some laws first, but I guarantee that\'s on his agenda.'
'Holy plagued your infected heavily with TDS'
'What does any of that have to do with this article and/or the misleading nature of posting the altered headline in this sub?'
"He didn't get played.  He was ordered to do so by his boss, Putin.  Further evidence that he is Putin's cock holster."
'Nope, full blown treason; if true.\n\n/does anyone have a source, that hasn\'t been "disappeared"?'
'We need to move away from this idea of "collusion" this is a [criminal conspiracy to commit treason.](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/thomas-jefferson-street/articles/2018-02-16/why-muellers-13-russians-indictment-could-be-very-bad-news-for-trump?context=amp) Which is **a crime.**'
"**Trump–Russia dossier**\n\nThe Trump–Russia dossier, also known as the Steele dossier, is a private intelligence report comprising 17 memos that were written from June to December 2016 by Christopher Steele, a former head of the Russia Desk for British intelligence (MI6). It contains allegations of misconduct and conspiracy between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and the Government of Russia during the 2016 election cycle, with campaign members and Russian operatives allegedly colluding to interfere in the election to benefit Trump. It also alleged that Russia sought to damage Hillary Clinton's candidacy, including sharing negative information about Clinton with the Trump campaign. The dossier was published in full by BuzzFeed on January 10, 2017.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28"
"Huh.  It's almost like when some people ask questions, they aren't just doing it as an insincere and underhanded way to throw accusations, and they are actually trying to find the answer to the question.  What has the world come to?  "
"Something that shows that Trump isn't a sock-puppet without an independent functional brain in policy. Taking out the war-games was a good idea, but once again it was fucking ruined by Trump lacking a brain and just taking orders from what another RIVAL political leader told him. "
"I don't know whats scarier. Him losing in 2020 or him winning in 2020.  I honestly don't think he'd leave the white house without nearly starting civil war or a constitutional crises. Im certain he mentally can't accept losing. So he'll declare the election fraudulent and fight the results. What happens if a President refuses to step down, and a large armed rabid populace backs him truly believing he is the rightful winner?   \n"
'Millions of Americans are told by Fux news that Trump kicked ass.  '
"I am absolutely certain that is what many Germans were telling those in fear of Hitler's rise during the early '30s"
">People outside this sub read that headline and go, “oh, that’s just some clickbait”. You guys read it and have a brain aneurysm.\n\nPersonally, I read the article.  Headlines aren't a good place to get information or make decisions about your ideological alignments."
'Stupid tariffs\n\nEnvironmental policy\n\nHealth care\n\nAnd so on and so forth. Not “grandmaster Putin planned the whole NK summit”'
'This seems to be an all too common sentiment nowadays - horrifying stuff.'
"> I'm just trying to understand the mentality of many of those who oppose what is actually happening with North Korea?\n\nNobody is opposing a potential deal with North Korea. That is a horrible straw man. The fact that NK is closer than they have ever been to *some kind* of deal that might bring *some sort* of peace is good. Literally everything else around the deal is a flaming pile of shit. \n\nJust because people are skeptical of this administrations motivations doesn't mean people actually oppose the deal itself. "
'Incoming tweetshit about how the Deep State is attacking America (along with some non sequitors about Hillary/Obama) in 3..2..1..'
'I would literally give everything I own to see this cunt spend just one day in jail...'
"Jr: Daddy, Bubba's tyrin to make me his bitch ...\n\n\nPrisoner, 5847355: Shudd-up and keep punching licence plates ..."
"I want an arrest warrant.  Til that happens, these articles don't mean anything."
'Is this what the Trump campaign was bleating about when they accused Obama of wiretapping during the campaign?'
'I’m curious...how bad is this for Jr?'
'Unless the wiretap was illegal ;)'
'Remember a question for a 15 year old son?  That was mine!!  I couldn’t even hear the response because I was sobbing.  My son, however, took notes.  He joked that someone said something about contemporaneous note-taking.  :-)'

"I actually don't mind their breakfast, everything else sucks though."
'He said "Да, я хотел чтобы он выиграл.", which literally means "Yes, I wanted him to win". The translator messed up at the beginning.'
'Makes sense to me that he would support a candidate pro-russia instead of someone who would want to go to war with Russia...\n\n'
'Cold war'
"That's what I assumed was happening. I don't believe for a second that Putin is so stupid as to blatantly admit to influencing the American election, during a press conference, with the American president standing next to him."
'Thanks for this. I was a little suspicious of the translation, it kind of sounded weird even when the translator was speaking it. Doubt Putin would be that stupid to just blatantly say "oh yeah I meddled in the US election".'
'Because this is just a small translation error, but something that changes the meaning greatly, especially when the video is cut. He said "Да, я хотел чтобы он выиграл.", which literally means "Yes, I wanted him to win", and I\'m not sure how this could be a surprise to anyone.'
'And one moron, you.'
"Trump ran part of his campaign on saying how weak America has been, now he wants America to be Putin's bitch."
'For whatever reason /r/news is a cesspool of red hat brigadiers. They flood the fuck out of any article which is remotely critical of dear leader.'
"Which can only be accomplished by America capitulating to Russia, since Russia has lost its circle of influence and might.\n\nHe's literally saying he wants the Cold War back and we should let him act like a fucking belligerent dictator. Trumps supporters are suddenly worried about WWIII after years of calling Obama a pussy.\n\nFrankly, with how crazy Russia is acting, I wonder if they are in a total shambles and this would be a great time to invade. Is Vlad hiding the secret that they lost their launch codes? The only nukes they now have are the ones they are testing now?\n\nNATO from the west and China and Japan from the east. It'll be over in week.\n\nOkay. I swear I'm not drunk.\n\n"
'Makes sense. But am I being downvoted to hell if that’s not being disputed 😂'
'Because trump is an idiot, if he was just more straight forward. '
'> I was more referring the fact that the translator ignored the part where he said “Yes, I did want Trump to win”, simplifying it down to a simple “Yes”.\n\nBut he didn\'t, he simply jumped the gun after the "Da" from Putin by translating it right away as "Yes, i did!". And then had to repeat the "Yes" so the rest of Putin\'s response would make sense as a full phrase.  '
"I'm beyond disgusted right now. That was the most brutal takedown of democracy that I've witnessed in my entire life. This is beyond partisan politics or policy disagreements. Please, PLEASE call all of your representatives and help protect the Mueller investigation.\n\nEdit: Typo"
'Here ready to fucking vote the fucker out, John.'
"If you've gone this far you are no longer a supporter. You are a cultist and it will be very difficult to change. Until the red hats face consequences that kick them right in the balls,nothing will change.  "

'Go fuck yourself'
"Easy. Propaganda and a constant intelligence campaign being run by foriegners. Murdoch has done more to erode America than anyone else. Putin just took advantage of an already weakened and ripe electorate. Murdoch tried to play Putins's game, but lost control of his subjects to the master"
"They're just as gullible as Trump is. "

"He's setting up the stage to either postpone elections, or contest and attempt to nullify the results. He's laying the foundations for consolidation of power."
'And the fake news. “See they’re doctoring videos now!”'
"Even if someone else made the error, the White House known about it for a full week and has not corrected it yet (I checked). At this point, regardless of whether the original error was made by an oddity in the Bloomberg feed, it's a willful omission for it to have not been fixed."
"It's easy to forget given the torrent of bullshit that comes out of this admin... but during the election, when questioned if he would accept the outcome of the election if he lost, Trump wouldn't answer in the affirmative. "
'I sure the fuck hope not.  \n\nTo me that just seems ..... dangerous from a civil unrest perspective.'

TFW Comey tweets and you just know he fucking knows the next shoe's about to drop
Giuliani: Trump fired Comey because he wouldn't tell Trump he wasn't target in Russia probe
'This is why George Washington warned us about the dangers of parties. '
'Lol what a shit show'
'Wahhh!\n\nI mean, oh you poor dears!'
'They’re  being attacked for being partisan hacks'
'Comey is the epitome of a partisan attack! '
"Why would he not be biased? Do you know of Comey's connection to the Clintons? Isn't the fact that the FBI did not prosecute because no intent proof enough? If Comey was going to be unbiased he should have recused himself all the way back in the beginning, same with Mueller. Witch Hunt, worse than Watergate. We all know it. "
'Well, so much for them being the “let’s manage our deficit party”'
"Yeah, I'll never forgive him for that."
'Republicans are a big criminal organization. '
'Putin is a dick head '
'"Only Pro-Trump Republicans should be able to to investigate Trump!"  \n  \nSo only Democrats can investigate Democrats then, right?  \n  \n"What? Of course not. That would be a conflict of interest."'
"Wait.. so to be unbiased means you have to completely ignore the entire situation? It's not just act with honor and integrity in a manner consistent with professionalism? \n\nGet the fuck on troll. "
'>Witch Hunt, worse than Watergate. We all know it. \n\nNo, most people around here follow reality based media.'
"Don't you have better things to do?"
'>We all know it.  \n  \nAnd by "we" you mean all the Russians, bots, and morons over on r/the_dipshit, right?'
"Pedophilia just isn't an issue for them. They could have forced Moore out and replace him with a non- Democrat, but when the president himself is a sexual predator, there is no threshold for decency or morality any longer."
'My taxes will go down by 0.1% and then back up by 0.2% in the mid 2020s. It has virtually no direct impact on me and millions of other middle income Americans.'
'Agreed, ‘party’ is no longer accurate for them. Organization is much more appropriate.\n\nSo instead of GOP, it’d be GOO'
'The same argument could be said about Trump and Russia '
'Including GWB for just being too stupid to handle anything more than the trash'
'So by my count, Trump has issued 3 pardons now:\n\n1 for lying\n\n1 for leaking\n\nAnd 1 for leaking and lying'
'I think he did this to show his power to those whom he\'s asked to perjure themselves on his account.  "See?  I\'m the president.  If you get caught lying for me, I\'ll pardon you."  Can anyone point me to info discussing this as his motive?\n\nEdit: grammer'
'A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds.  Or, um, something.'
"If he didn't have double standards, he would have no standards. "
"It's like when he pardoned the evil monster Arpaio, as a signal to potential witnesses that he's willing to use the pardon power even on the most despicable of people. This time he's signaling that lying to federal investigators to cover up the administration's crimes is also pardonable, in case anyone didn't get the hint. "
"It's like the Donald did something completely irrational that no one can understand."
"Amazingly he'll go down for lying down while hookers were leaking on him. "
"There's also the fact that anything even remotely resembling criticism is immediately removed by the mods."
'One step closer to Mueller getting canned, then the rest of the GOP has to shit or get off the pot.'
'Any one of those people who take a gamble on his hints are going to seriously regret it. '
'Maybe he just knows where the bodies are buried and threatens to talk.'
'Admins really removed the dumpster mods? '
'...and they have a stickied megathread about it.\n\n> They shut it down to buy some time to reorganize and figure out what the fuck to do since all of the top mods are gone. \n\n!!!!! '
"Brainwashing?  No, it's education.  Who are you to stand in the way of what Putin wants?  /s"
'My bad. NY Feds are still Federal agents! '
"He's not a smart man. "
"Remember how Mussolini's regime ended.  Of course, he'd destroyed his country first...."
'No fucking way dude!? Really!!'
"Don’t act like Trump intended for that nuance to matter.\n\nThe man is literally that stupid.\n\nEdit:  Stupidity is the idea of people still supporting this man when we're ever closer to nuclear war due to his fucking ego and his twitter account"
"   [Here you go](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-cia-director-mike-flynn-and-turkish-officials-discussed-removal-of-erdogan-foe-from-u-s-1490380426)\n\nDevin Nunes, a California Congressman, who has been the most vocal about  stopping Special Counsel Mueller's investigation, has also been alleged to have been in the same room as Michael Flynn, Michael Flynn's son, and Turkish officials when discussing the possible kidnapping and return to Turkey of an American citizen who Erdogan has labeled as the leader of the failed coup attempt in June of 2016."
'He obviously means he wants them to go to prison, not jail.'
"SHS: the presidents tweets are official white house statements\n\nAlso SHS: the president doesn't actually mean everything he says\n\nThese people are retards and criminals. "
'I can believe it. There is simply sooooooo much crap with the cheeto in chief that something will inevitably get through '
'Oh, I thought he was a deranged, drunk Nazi. Hard to keep up with the left in their constant pursuit of confirmation bias.'
'That’s why we call it stupid watergate. It’s just like watergate. Only really stupid.'
'Same, this was a big part of the dirt about Flynn.'
'When all is said and done the democrats will no longer exist.'
'You’re a funny guy. You and the Colluder in Chief have a lot in common, you both seem completely ignorant of the mountain of bullshit you’re buried in.'
"Republican appointed, republican registered impartial special council, republican obstruction of investigation, republican majority congress. Sorry to inform you of this, but this is only even capable of looking bad for republicans. If something turns up (like what already has) repubs look bad. If nothing turns up, repubs interfered with investigation. If something turns up and no one is held accountable, repubs are claiming to be above the rule of law. \n\nThe simplest way for them to have looked good would have been to comply with an investigation and be found innocent (hmm, wonder why they didn't just choose that option...) \n\n It's funny that people who freaked out over fake conspiracies like Obama's birth certificate aren't interested in investigating actual shady issues like inappropriate business dealings and unofficial, deliberately concealed meetings with foreign representatives. It's almost like you don't care about holding government offices to high scrutiny anymore for some wierd reason."
'Burden of proof is on you guys. Lotta big talk. We have the White House.'
"Troll level the past 24 hours: ludicrous. They've gone to plaid."
'Trump admitted that he fired comey because of the Russia thing on live tv w lester holt. And then bounced around, backpedaled and couldn’t get a full sentence out. I can’t wait to hear the details of what really happened when comey speaks. '
'\nMaan.... fuck James comey'
"Call me I'd you're going to jail idiot"
'It\'s a calculated risk, but if he doesn\'t do it and she wins, it\'s a republican house and senate and an FBI director that withheld information during an election. Oh, and that candidate that just lost is Donald Trump, who\'s now legitimized in yelling "rigged".  Not to mention the gift that would have been to anyone that peddles in conspiracy.\n\nIt could have very much been it\'s own shit show, possibly worse over a longer timeline.\n\n'
'Almost as dumb as your first comment. '
'Baddest man in the whole damn town.  Mueller, that is.'
'He has no idea. Probably googling what his next talking points should be.'
"Silly troll; how come the current, Trump-controlled Justice Department hasn't brought charges? Could it be they know they can't convict her because there is no crime? I mean, they are almost 14 months in office and haven't done a thing.  \n\nBy the way, how's the weather in St. Petersburg this evening?"
"No it wasn't Hillary it was that dastardly traitor Snowball!! "
'LUDICROUS SPEED GO!  '
'From his letter on the same day:\n\n>Of course, we don’t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I **feel an obligation** to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed. **I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.**\n\nSo he wanted the public to know about the ongoing investigation when he sent the letter.\n\nAlso note the “feel an obligation” part, it’s different from “having” an obligation. I believe this shows that it was his own decision to send the letter, not because the rules obligated him to.\n\nEDIT: changed from "From the letter" to "From his letter on the same day"'
'Nice try, though, I don’t doubt that trolls and fake news farms are the primary way you get information. Keep on keeping on.'
'Somebody give this guy some comic books and send him on his way. He has a thumb suck. '
"The truth is McCabe is no different than Flynn. They both lied under oath and don't deserve a platform or to be trusted."
"Part of me wonders if this wasn't timed exactly to minimize exposure a bit.  Friday night and right before St Patrick's Day.\n\nFew months ago I would've dismissed this as being a bit too much like a conspiracy theory but wouldn't surprise me now if this was the case.\n\n- [MoveOn.org if Robert Mueller fired](https://act.moveon.org/event/mueller-firing-rapid-response-events/search/) "
'Nice try. Too bad your nonsense totally backfired :)'
'He could have gone a long way to restoring some character if he had told Trump no. I’m not really surprised he didn’t though. \n\nHe probably wants to last as long as possible so he can write a tell all or something...'
'I hope Sessions opens himself up to obstruction and witness intimidation charges by doing this. '
'It’s a right to work wet dream. Fire people for whatever reason you want with no consequences. They just forget that currently there might be some consequences '
'My bad. I thought you were responding to /u/Jaehaerys3.\n\nRegardless, /u/ka1913 is incorrect. At least with his first point.'
'My bad, McCabe and Trump'
'Did Sessions boss, Donald Trump every try to influence Sessions to fire McCabe?'
'Comey is going to subtle trump every chance he gets, and trump is so dumb he will never understand how hard Comey is jabbing at him.'
'It just occurred to me, James Comey & Robert Mueller would be the greatest crime fighting duo ever.'
'i feel you tbh\n\nbut when the president is 9999999x worse it might be called for'
"I doubt any 14-year-old has read Edmund Burke or know who that is. It doesn't apply there unless it is something a 14-year-old would even know. "
"Comey was doing what the job required him to do - if blame is assigned, cast more on Chaffetz: he's the one who leaked the Comey memo before it was supposed to go out. edit- spelling\n"
'Was it considered classified as part of an ongoing investigation? Because what he did should be illegal. '
'If they released proof of that, would it help you to have a negative opinion of him?'
'Reminds of the Nambia incident. It seems like that happened a thousand stupid comments ago.'
'9.2 Mooches ago.  Nearly an eternity in this political climate.'
'I trust in Mueller; a dedicated war veteran and public servant his entire life.  You trust in Trump; a fat, lazy and sex-addicted trust fund baby, con man and child rapist  (Ivanka was the first victim).  Let\'s see which one of us wins out.  Remindme! 1 year "Child sex rapist POTUS ststus"'
'Yeah see how your key word is alleged.\n\nWhile Mueller and Comey both actively framed an innocent man and your tax dollars paid him 5.8 million dollars.\n\nAlleged vs actually.\n\nSo you have no issue with law enforcement agents attempting to pin crimes on innocent individuals that have zero evidence pointing at them...\n\nOh sorry there were 2 dogs and a handlers interpretation... which a California judge threw out of court in a different trial in 97.\n\np.s i dont care about trump. Im just not a fan of shady law enforcement. We all lose when corrupt people like Comey exist and climb the food chain.\n\nHe should have been fired long ago and never allowed to work in law enforcement.'

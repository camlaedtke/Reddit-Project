Flynn charged with lying to the FBI
Trump's latest whine -- "why didn't the FBI warn me Russians might try to infiltrate my campaign!?!" -- which totally makes sense, if you ignore that the FBI warned Trump that Russians might try to infiltrate his campaign.
In 2002 (when Mueller was Director of the FBI) the CEO of Enron, Jeffrey Skilling, called the investigation against his company "a witch hunt." Skilling is still in prison.
White House reels as FBI director contradicts official claims about alleged abuser
So Trump just confessed that he knew Flynn lied to the FBI when he fired Comey in order to stop the investigation.
'And what really gets me he is a Republican not that it should matter but with how these crazy right wingers act you would think he is die hard liberal well like myself.'
'Listened to an angry talk show host on the radio who was bitching about Mueller not having any proof against Trump and Russia colluding because Mueller "refused" to release the evidence he had to the public. That\'s not how it works at all,dummy.'
'So bad ass'

">Another was Natalia Veselnitskaya , the Russian lawyer whose June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with Donald Trump Jr. has become a focus of the Russia investigation. She attended a black-tie inaugural party hosted by the campaign committee of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), according to an associate who accompanied her\n\n>In a statement, Veselnitskaya told The Post that she attended a private event in Washington that night at Akhmetshin’s invitation. She added that she did not go to the inauguration and was in the area because she was meeting the next day with an American woman frustrated by the Russian ban on adoptions by U.S. citizens.\n\n>Michael Tremonte, a lawyer for Akhmetshin, said his client recalls that he was given tickets by a person involved in organizing the event and that he invited Veselnitskaya to join him because he knew she was in town. Tremonte said Akhmetshin did not attend any official inaugural events.\n\n>Kenneth Grubbs, a spokesman for Rohrabacher’s congressional office, said the campaign has no record of Akhmetshin’s invitation to the party or of tickets purchased by him or Veselnitskaya.\n\nAs a reminder, Akhmetshin is the one who was with Veselnitskaya at the famous Trump Tower meeting with Don junior, kushner and manafort.\n\nSomehow I'm not surprised the two of them made an appearance at these events at Rohrabacher’s invitation and that Rohrabacher’s office doesn't seem to have any recollection of inviting them. It's so strange that his name keeps popping up and that he has the same kind of bad memory as everyone else who interacts with Russians. Maybe the real story here is that there is an outbreak of amnesia brought upon by contact with Russians. Probably the Clinton's and the other lizard people running the world who are deliberately doing this to frame these innocent patriots in an effort to sabotage Trump and subvert democracy. "

'I\'m a lawyer. You\'re in the right ballpark, but you\'re missing some important terminology. To get a search warrant, you need to show a judge probable cause that there is evidence of a crime. Believe it or not, the specific level denoted by "probable cause" is still open for debate in the legal community, but it\'s generally considered to mean that it\'s probable, or more likely than not. As I understand it (I don\'t practice criminal law but I\'ve done a bit of research), you don\'t need any higher level of evidence to obtain a no-knock warrant; you need to show a likelihood that evidence will be destroyed if you execute a standard search warrant.\n\nPut more simply, this confirms that Mueller\'s team was able to show a judge that it was likely Manafort had evidence of collusion-related crimes, and that he was likely to destroy it if they didn\'t get a no-knock warrant.'

The executive has accumulated too much power in the last 80 years. Trump is so chaotic and incompetent he's struggling to get much of anything done.

'Look at who sweats over Russian money investigations. Who is shitting themselves to put a stop to it.\n\nWhen this goes down, we are looking at- at very least- President Hatch. The rest will be "retired" or behind bars.'
'Usually the difference between a subject of an investigation and a target, is a simple piece of evidence. Mueller probably already has that evidence. However, the general consensus among legal experts is that when you are investigating the President of the USA, you do not need one piece of evidence, you need three of four corroborating pieces of evidence, to make him a target. Mueller is building his case from the outside in, gathering evidence against Trumps circle, indicting or flipping them, and slowly working itself inward.\n\nOne of the curious things about the article on he Trump meeeting is that the translator in the meeting is hardly ever mentioned. Its because Mueller is protecting him from any pressure from the press or the right wing press. The interpreter, as part of his practice, cannot divulge what was talked about in the meeting, but Mueller can compel through subpoena or request and most likely Mueller already knows what Manafort may or may not have received in information at that meeting. But the fact that they raided his house and business and was linked to the meeting means that there was something substantial from that meeting. All of the charges against Manafort are leveled to convince him to flip and corroborate that particular evidence, and other pieces.\n\nThe next order of business will be indictments against the hackers of the Democratic Party emails, and anyone caught trafficking in those documents, will be caught up. The emails are considered stolen property, a felony, and those holding those, as a computer files, or trafficking them by offering or asking for them, are co-conspirators and accomplices. What Mueller is doing now, is finding out who knew what and when. Its meticulous work, but these types of investigations become airtight and were the same tactics used by Mueller in prosecuting a the Gambino Mafia crime family. They were professional criminals who tried to be diligent and careful in covering their tracks, Trump and his "family" are clueless idiots'

He wasn't even a Republican years ago. \n\nYet, for some reason, even as the National Review and other conservative journalists, and even present and former Republican politicians, come out against this guy, *they* get thrown aside and attacked. \n\nIt's like watching everyone at a family reunion suddenly embracing a cousin's drunk-ass new boyfriend and telling anyone who criticizes him to go the fuck home.

'The voices crying out for reason are the core GOP,  or "real Republicans".   \n\nThe people supporting Trump are the crazy people the GOP co-opted during the 1970s (when Nixon brought racists into the fold) and the 1980s (when Regan brought religious nuts in the fold).  \n\nThe Democrats had been in power since the New Deal.  Then the the GOP united the Three R\'s (**R**ich people,  **R**acists,  and **R**eligious nuts) under the Republican\'s anti-big-government banner and had a good few decades from the 1980s through the 2000s.\n\nBut an entire generation of right wing crazy people grew up supported by an establishment that told them their crazy ideas were legitimate.  And like Frakenstein\'s monster they broke free of their masters,  and are lurching half-aware through the public discourse with no clear idea of what is going on.\n\nThe GOP doesn\'t feel that they can tell the crazy people how crazy they and maintain a hold on power.  They are broken.  If Trump hadn\'t won the Republican Primary,  it would have gone to Ted Cruz.  Consider the significance of that.  Trump didn\'t hijack the Republican Primary from the GOP.

But how about we maintain a rated list of who got what, and how terrible they\'ve been at it? Setting illegal behavior aside, we have a nation to defend from *that list of judges*, even after we vote folks out of Congress.'

"How are you guys legit this delusional?\n\n1. Comey literally lost the election for Clinton. He publicly announced that the investigation was reopened like a week before Election Day for fucks sake. How do you even remember to bathe with memory this poor? This was like a fucking year ago. Muh bias.\n\n2. Trump ostensibly had comey fired because he acted in a way that arguably lost Clinton the election. That's what I love about this, you idiots are so brain dead you don't even actually know the supposed reason the DOJ fired him. You think it's because comey was biased *towards* Clinton, when in reality Trump is arguing the opposite. But you fuck nuts literally do not comprehend shit, so in your mind it's because he was biased towards Clinton. Fucking. Imbecile.\n\n3. Witch hunt? Lmfao. 4 indictments and 2 pleas dipshit.\n\nCan I be real with you? Why are you guys so fucking delusional and stupid? Honestly. Do you not remember cheering for comey a year ago?

Why not openly say something like "so he\'s bounced a few ex wives around, so what? we aren\'t paying him to be a boyscout at home" and move on?\n\nThe reason, of course, is that it\'s a big deal, others have explained why with a lot of detail, but keep asking yourself this question: if it\'s not important, why lie about it?

That is not a crime, and I know you said to set that aside an all but I just can\'t help but harping on it because it is pretty important, we are talking about something that *may* have happened as if it where the end of the world, when it\'s not only NOT a crime but its something *our* government does to other countries all the time. It\'s not illegal. Sorry but it\'s not.\n\n\n"Do you agree that that\'s probably why Russians would give money to an American gun-rights organization? If you agree, then please tell me, does that bother you?" \n\nIf it\'s true, and that\'s a big IF, no. It doesn\'t because that sort of shit has been probably going on sence the dawn of the cold War. Did the Russians cast counterfeit votes at the ballot office? Did the Russians infiltrate the election HQs and rig the number? I\'d certainly care about that kind of shit. but the Russians allegedly donated money to an American activist organization who advertised for one American candidate over another that the American citizens had the choice of weather or not to vote on?

"[When Paul Manafort met Ferdinand Marcos in the 1980s, each had something the other wanted. . . . Marcos earmarked huge sums of cash for Reagan’s 1980 and 1984 campaigns — as much as $57 million, according to one claim made to Philippine investigators. There’s no evidence that any cash ever made it into Reagan’s coffers, which would have been illegal since U.S. election laws ban donations from foreigners. And, despite extensive government investigations on both sides of the Pacific into the freewheeling spending of the Marcos regime, there’s never before been much serious inquiry of what ultimately happened to the cash intended for political contributions. ](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/2016-donald-trump-paul-manafort-ferinand-marcos-philippines-1980s-213952)\n\nYeah, that Manafort.

That Mr. Mueller could have roasted Donald Trump six months out using nothing more than the $103,000,000 loss claim in that 2005 federal 1040.

And have effected repayment for the double-counting of these losses from 1995 through 2004 as well.\n\nComplex tax fraud has no statute of limitations. There's also forgery in there as well as conspiracy between Trump and the actual crooks who prepared that filed document. RICO, yes.\n\nThis is not about Trump alone.

'Growing up as a “white minority” is certainly nothing like what the cowards are afraid of.  You fit in the way people do- befriend people with similar values and have a spine.  The fear of black Americans is in some ways understandable, there’s a higher poverty rate in black communities and crime follows poverty.  Add that nearly all ethnic communities tend to be tough on outsiders and you have the stereotypes. All of which is manageable and not an issue if you’re thoughtful and capable.  \n\nJust as there are some places that black Americans don’t leave the car, the same is true for whites.  Both are wrong and need changing, but there’s definitely more history and prevalence in modern society of white on black racism.  Whites have blocks to avoid, blacks have cities.\n\nThe hysteria is simple to understand through a historical lens.  If you’re simultaneously calling a group weak and dangerous, you’re pretty well a sack of racist crap and not a viable modern human.  Be thoughtful when encountering problematic elements and you’ll be ok regardless of what angle you’re coming from.'

'I have a feeling that no matter what, he’ll be able to hide behind plausible deniability for any collusion involving interference with the election.

To me, “no collusion” is just shorthand for, “I’ve done a bunch of illegal and unethical shit that I’m trying to hide, but you won’t get me on this collusion thing.” '
'Yeah, as we come to learn more about the facts of what happened, a time will come when the media will need to substitute "conspiracy" for "collusion." Collusion is a broad term that essentially refers to under the table communications to achieve certain goals, in bad faith. Conspiracy is a crime, but the important thing is that it goes along with other crimes. E.g. Conspiracy to commit murder is a crime which exists apart from the actual crime of murder. Colluding with a foreign government to win an election could be a broad description for any number of acts which may have taken place, most or all of which would be illegal.\n\nBut until we know what *exactly* are the laws he is alleged to have broken, I think the shorthand "collusion" is probably better for everyday discussion than "conspiracy," without identifying the attendant crime.'

"Fantasies. Unrealistic crap for people who haven't actually had to navigate the real world very much. Minimum wage laws meant I was able to feed and house myself when I was younger. And none of your other things here make any sense in the real world either. Libertarianism is as unrealitic as Communism. Neither takes into account the shitty nature of human beings."

'So if _I_ was McCabe I would be retaining council to file a wrongful termination lawsuit and fight to get my pension back. Even if he has a weak case, he only has to get it to the discovery phase, then he can subpoena all the documents related to his firing. If Trump was trying to cover anything up there it will have yet another avenue into the public record (besides Mueller, stormy,  etc obv)'
'Finger pyramid of evil contemplation!'
"Nobody cares what you guys think. You're like the angry 5% of the population that everyone hates.\n\nGet back in your safe space. The rest of us will fix the country, while you make up bullshit about why you're right and fantasize about revolutions you're to weak and stupid to take part in."
"Why do so many of the people that Trump appointed hate Trump and think that he is an idiot.  Tillerson called him 'fucking moron' Nunberg thinks that Trump is a vile human being and hates him.\n\nAll the best people think that Trump is a piece of shit."
'So how long has McCabe been sitting on this evidence? Was he just waiting to be fired to use it as retaliation?'
"Gave his wife money for her campaign run in local politics while McCabe made sure ahead of time to violate no ethics rules. People in Democratic and Republican parties give money to the campaigns of other members of their party. McCabe made sure to follow the rules. Lots of Republicans in influential positions gave to Trump's campaign. So did Russia, which is so much worse, because they're a hostile foreign government. It sucks to be wrong but you gotta come back man - Donald Trump is a traitor to America who is using fascist tactics to confuse you. You're confused and angry, but that doesn't make you right. You're being played dude, you're not being an American patriot. You're being manipulated into supporting treason."
'>\tSo how long has McCabe been sitting on this evidence?\n\nHe’s probably been keeping memos on his meetings with the President sInce he started meeting with the President. \n\n>\tWas he just waiting to be fired to use it as retaliation?\n\nYou’re assuming there’s something incriminating in these memos. You’re also assuming that Mueller doesn’t already have them. That’s a lot to assume. '
"I'm not a Democrat and not a fan of HC and I say Trump is dirty as they come. Anyone who can't see it is stupid dumb or paid to troll."
"Wait are you agreeing with me or disagreeing with me? You do know political contributions / lobbying is legal in America right? Shouldn't be, but it is. This is the DNC supporting the DNC, which isn't nearly as shady as say a gun lobby or a prescription lobby. A hostile foreign country doing this is called treason.\n\nTreason - the crime of betraying one's country, especially by attempting to kill the sovereign or overthrow the government.\n\nTrump is beholden to Russia, he won because of working with Russia and he is clearly fulfilling his end of the bargain by defending them in so many ways that hurt America. Just gonna suck when your children and their children are ashamed of where you stood on this. Not too late for ya man. "
'And judging by your comment history you have shitty critical thinking skills as well.'
'Apologies for trying to shame man, I get heated. Look, America has done what Russia has done a hundred times, influenced elections, established our preferred rulers, undermined democracies with disinformation campaigns. From the LA Times: \n\n"The U.S. has a long history of attempting to influence presidential elections in other countries – it\'s done so as many as 81 times between 1946 and 2000, according to a database amassed by political scientist Dov Levin of Carnegie Mellon University.\nThat number doesn\'t include military coups and regime change efforts following the election of candidates the U.S. didn\'t like, notably those in Iran, Guatemala and Chile. Nor does it include general assistance with the electoral process, such as election monitoring."\n\nI don\'t think this is right, but I\'m an American patriot, I love this country. But when Russia does this to us, fuck them and fuck their puppet. Trump is a traitor to my country.'
"Exactly. But that's us doing it to another country, which as an American I far prefer to goddamn Russia doing it to us. I'm a Republican, I don't like Hillary, she's shady as hell, I didn't vote for either of them, I think the fact she screwed Bernie so bad is an assault on our democracy too. But that doesn't discount that Russia did this shit to us. Hillary is irrelevant and a distraction to the fact Trump is Russia's bitch, and when an American president is Russia's bitch, he should go to jail for treason. Hell maybe I'm wrong tho the facts make it overwhelmingly seem like I understand this, but at least first let us look into it thoroughly shall we? Let's make sure we're not being forced to be Russia's little bitch. "

'There are always a few comments that are so dumb they stop you in your tracks. This is one of those comments.'
"Anything you do for security is a matter of shifting the balance of cost to circumvent and expected value. Most information that people shred wouldn't be particularly valuable to the FBI, and while it might be useful to a criminal, private investigator, etc., if its value is less than the cost of reassembling it (which still requires labor and computational resources), then it's relatively safe.\n\nYou can apply the same idea, for example, to a bike lock. Say your bike can be sold for $50 stolen, and you put a lock on it that will take a skilled thief five minutes to pick, and a chain that can't be easily cut. Sure, it's completely feasible to steal it, but it's probably not economical to do so. Any smart thief will move on to a bike with no lock, or one with an easily snipped cable, or a lock that can be raked in 30 seconds. And even if _everyone_ uses the same lock and chain as you used, thieves will focus on more expensive bikes, or on non-bike opportunities which are either easier or higher value."
'I am going to go on out on a limb here but I am really starting to think Donald Trump is a real piece of shit. '
'Well... username checks out but u should probably leave a /s just in case.  Still, I hate those words even in a sarcastic context.'
'The evidence was compelling?\n\nThe evidence was 2 dogs.\n\nWhile a tip given by a women was ignored that pointed directly at the correct suspect. a suspect who had shared ownership of anthrax patents, was diagnosed as being paranoid and had a habit of stalking and threatening people with anonymous letters.\n\nBut yeah those 2 dogs were such compelling evidence even though a Judge in 97 ruled that blood hounds aint reliable as evidence to base a criminal conviction on.'
'Classic "whataboutism". Let me play too! Trump is an alleged rapist. Your move, loser. '
"Trump is a failed tinpot dictator who has literally only passed 1 piece of legislation in his first year and has spent 20% of his time so far golfing and 20% of his time firing the shitty hires he picked.  Another 20% of his time is spent bitching about how unfair the adults are to his crappy Presidency on Twitter.  The other 40% is devoted to watching TV, eating fast food and changing his diapers in the residence. He's a fat, demented old man with Alzheimers whose biggest accomplishment in life has been fathering all of Ivanka's children.  Pathetic."
"I'm not sure what money you're talking about the only money I mention to the five point eight million dollars that your government had to pay to the innocent man that Muller and call me attempted to frame for the anthrax attacks of the year 2001 when they had anonymous tip who told them about a person that pretty much had access to Anthrax who had a history of psychotic behavior and also a history of sending Anonymous threatening letters to people but they decided to ignore that Witnesses tip and they decided to go on a guy who was innocent because to bloodhounds\n\nAnd for your information in 1997 California judge threw out Bloodhound evidence as the sole evidence to order a murder conviction and called it asinine pretty much\n\nAnd yes the other part is your people are allowing your Presidents to waste millions of your dollars while doing things like golfing or for example Obama when he spent millions of dollars flying around the country campaigning for Hillary Clinton I mean it's his job to run America or is his job to ensure that his Democratic party gets reelected again obviously you guys have an issue in your country that you don't care about fixing because you're fighting against each other instead of teaming up with each other against those m************ were robbing you blind but you're all idiots so keep doing what you're doing"
"Your argument might hold on Judge Judy, but factually, your argument does not hold water as it pertains to Mueller's stellar  character and skills as a prosecutor."
"[NYT:](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/us/politics/trump-michael-flynn.html)\n\n>If Mr. Trump had known at the time that Mr. Flynn lied to the F.B.I., that could amount to obstruction of justice.\n\nWhat the Trump team is going to argue is that Trump's intentional meaning of the Tweet is that he confused the current allegations with the initial firing. Whether a court/Congress would believe that to be reasonable doubt is questionable. It's the same reason that Trump's admission on live TV that he fired Comey because of Russia can have reasonable doubt. \n\n"
'I do not normally watch Fox News, but the local channel broadcasts it. The TV was left on today, and they were talking about this.  One of the guys on this "panel" actually had the audacity to say (paraphrasing) "Since Flynn admitted he lied to the FBI, anything he testifies could also be a lie, so don\'t listen to anything he says!".\n\nDo these folks even believe what is coming out of their mouths?  Can they be that dumb?   If Flynn is testifying, heads are gonna roll, full stop.  Which head(s) exactly, remains to be seen.'
'What? He fired Flynn because he lied. Comey was fired for not doing his job. Obama administration gave Flynn permission. Another failed anti Trump sub '
'You must be fit for you to undergo such rigorous mental gymnastics to come up with that conclusion from this tweet.\n\nOr an outright liar, which is typical of you disgusting antifa Democrats.'
'I tried to step back for a second last night and think about all of this from a historical context and what kind of precedence (or "presidents" if you\'re Trump) this sets. Trump\'s ascension along with the series of scandals in its wake just seems so far beyond the pale of normalcy. \n\nMy concern is that removing Trump from office via impeachment or  through elections, will not restore order to our institutions and government. We\'ve crossed the bridge and burned it down. Even if Trump is gone, we have a sizable population of people that are fiercely loyal to Trump as a person, as well as his tactics and political philosophy. That is a major problem. The institutions, checks and balances  and civil order that our nation is founded upon is under attack - removing a President will not shore up the systematic framework of the nation; it will still be on fire.\n\nAbraham Lincoln\'s Lyceum Address has been echoing in my head during the election and throughout Trump\'s first year in office:\n\n> "Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow? Never! All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not by force take a drink from the Ohio or make a track on the Blue Ridge in a trial of a thousand years. At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer. If it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us; it cannot come from abroad. **If destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen we must live through all time or die by suicide.**"\n\nLets hope we are able to recover, both institutionally as well as a community of people, from the divide that we find ourselves in currently.'
"Caligula?  Why's that?  From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula#Scandals):\n\n> Philo of Alexandria and Seneca the Younger describe Caligula as an insane emperor who was self-absorbed, angry, killed on a whim, and indulged in too much spending and sex.[102] He is accused of sleeping with other men's wives and bragging about it,[103] killing for mere amusement,[104] deliberately wasting money on his bridge, causing starvation,[105] and wanting a statue of himself erected in the Temple of Jerusalem for his worship.[98] **Once, at some games at which he was presiding, he ordered his guards to throw an entire section of the audience into the arena during the intermission to be eaten by the wild beasts because there were no prisoners to be used and he was bored.**"
'I had a Western Civs history professor that, after covering the fall of the Roman Empire made it clear that he believed that we were experiencing the American analog to the [Pax Romana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Romana) (the Pax Americana, if you will) and that America would likely suffer the same problems and was destined for a decline, or worse, and would follow in the footsteps of the Roman Empire.\n\nAlways found that to be really interesting.\n\nEDIT: link'

"I don't think there should be a coup but I don't think it's far-fetched to think about what the military will do if Trump orders them to do something stupid. If he orders air strikes on Tehran, does Mattis have to do it?"
'Still, somebody has to be arrested; in fact, I would choose to be cops and the FBI and not the military. You know Trump will refuse to step down. :( If Trump were to somehow become a "president" (Read: Dictator) for more than 8 years, then yes, a coup would be a necessity.'
'I think it will take a bit more than that to reach that point. Basically, if you think of both that oath and the second amendment; the requirement for violent action when the government evokes something that will stop people from speaking. Meaning people in the streets with guns to force your silence or secret police. There is no sign of that at this moment, his current defense against them is two fold. Despite what you think, there is still many high ranking members of the military that will not agree to these types of actions. Secondly, the DoJ is separate for the White House, so there should be the ability to hold Trump accountable, and at the very least vote him out.   '
'Mattis would have to resign. The Joint Chiefs could refuse an illegal order, along with every officer below them. The question is, would they see it as an illegal order? And would they have the balls to say no, since they would almost certainly be arrested for insubordination by somebody.'
"Those weren't illegal orders. Now, refusing refugees entry is illegal, but ICE/CBP have already shown for 17 years they don't care about the law. Remember when they shot and killed a Mexican kid from across the boarder? Or when they trespassed on private land to destroy water reservoirs? Or left fences open so cattle could escape?"
"> Shit at this point he could just take the money, put it in stock and have the pension that he lost.\n\nI bet if he was a Trump appointee he would do that. The problem with McCabe is integrity.

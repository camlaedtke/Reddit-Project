'> Not a "Trumpian" but the flip side is, any other person on the planet would be in jail or have lost their security clearance had they handled classified material the way in which clinton and her team did.\n\nHere\'s the portion of the FBI investigation press release at the conclusion of the investigation dealing with their recommendation to the DoJ, emphasis added:\n\n> In our system, the prosecutors make the decisions about whether charges are appropriate based on evidence the FBI has helped collect. Although we don’t normally make public our recommendations to the prosecutors, we frequently make recommendations and engage in productive conversations with prosecutors about what resolution may be appropriate, given the evidence. In this case, given the importance of the matter, I think unusual transparency is in order.\n\n> Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before bringing charges. There are obvious considerations, like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent. Responsible decisions also consider the context of a person’s actions, and how similar situations have been handled in the past.\n\n> In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. **All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here.**\n\n> To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions. But that is not what we are deciding now.\n\n> As a result, although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case.\n\n> I know there will be intense public debate in the wake of this recommendation, as there was throughout this investigation. What I can assure the American people is that this investigation was done competently, honestly, and independently. No outside influence of any kind was brought to bear.\n\n> I know there were many opinions expressed by people who were not part of the investigation—including people in government—but none of that mattered to us. Opinions are irrelevant, and they were all uninformed by insight into our investigation, because we did the investigation the right way. Only facts matter, and the FBI found them here in an entirely apolitical and professional way. I couldn’t be prouder to be part of this organization.'

"What might be the motivation behind this? Some theories are being offered..:\n\n- An attempt to gather favor with Republicans and the Trump base in general?\n- Some unknown quid-pro-quo where Trump is doing this to gain someone's help?\n- Driven by spite against Comey (who was FBI director when this incident happened)?\n- Just Trump's usual erratic behavior?\n- Some combination of the above?"
'This is such sleazy messaging to scum like Cohen, Kushner, Donny Jr. , little Eric and all the other known, and as yet unknown, liars who carried the can for Trump.  All Trump toadies and criminals will be pardoned he collaterally declares. Everyday there is a new convulsion in the body politic. Democracy has to expel the bile and toxins to be well again. Scooter Libby is emblematic of the bile, and secondarily is consistent with Bolton getting his way to boot. Libby was the kind of neo-con slug that Bolton sees as a loyal soldier to his cause and instincts. Mueller and his team will not lose their nerve and despite the abuse of Executive power Trump and his kind will be humbled and brought to justice. Finding the pee-pee video, isn’t essential, or for that matter important, it’s just the metaphor to put the period at the end of the sentence: Here is the end of the Trump presidency. '
'But is Libby still important enough and connected to the GOP establishment where they would owe him a favor. If Trump wanted support in the firing of Mueller or Rosenstein, I imagine the GOP would exact something far more valuable to them than the pardoning of a disgraced aide no one has really thought about for years. '
'This article made some good suggestions as to why, I believe.\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2018/04/13/politics/trump-scooter-libby-pardon/index.html\n\nPersonally, I think railing against the decisions of a special council in general (and *specifically* one appointed by Comey) makes the most sense, as does the connection between diGenova and Toensing with Libby, who have apparently still been talking with Trump despite declining to represent him.\n\nTake "revenge" on an enemy while doing a favor for a couple supporters? Seems to check out.'
"Great point - hadn't thought of that."
'Its such a terrible way to approach politics. To treat it like a team sport to which you choose a team and owe that team unwavering support regardless of that team constantly doing things that go directly against your self interest. Nobody owes any politicians or political party that type of loyalty. You owe them loyalty only while they are living up to what you feel is bettering your life and country. This blind faith and cult like support is pathetic and has much more to do with a personality cult and a sad need to feel like you "win" something than it does political policy that they agree with.'

'just what i’ve gathered from following this saga, but i looked it up\n\n>[In the United States, the pardon power for federal crimes is granted to the President of the United States under Article II, Section 2 of the United States Constitution which states that the President "shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment". The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted this language to include the power to grant pardons, conditional pardons, commutations of sentence, conditional commutations of sentence, remissions of fines and forfeitures, respites, and amnesties. The pardon can also be used for a presumptive case, such as when President Gerald Ford pardoned Nixon over any possible crimes regarding the Watergate scandal. There is a strong consensus among legal experts that a president cannot pardon someone for state crimes. Experts disagree as to whether a president can pardon himself.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_pardons_in_the_United_States) '

'I hope so. That said, Comey\'s handling of the emails certainly gave Trump a sizable boost that he may not have won without, so it\'s hard for me not to be suspicious of any claim of "honor."

Maybe you don\'t know what those words mean, but endearing means "inspiring affection" and pensive means "reflecting deep or serious thought." It is very unlikely I would say that comeys postings are senial babble, mostly because senial isn\'t a word and the phrase has no meaning. Hopefully you aren\'t too dense to understand.'

Other then constantly putting his foot in his mouth and alienate himself further. I support that.'
'Absolute not, he knew it was his ass if the truth came out, but you\'re right in that he was so stupid that he fired Comey and actually thought that would end it all and he was safe.\nTrump was a private citizen all his life and did not know thing one about public service and the expectations when given the responsibility. There was little doubt in his mind that he could bring in people to cover his back, like Sen Sessions, who unlike Trump was elected to office and knew the routine. Sessions chose the Sgt Shultz defense of "I see nothing,..nothing" and quickly disentangled himself with a recusal.\n\nNo, trump knew he conspired with those who suggested a covert operation WITH the Russians to help him win and knew there is always a payback.\n\nAnd I am also sure that Trump never envisioned that there would be such a reaction to all this, as this campaign  was just like he did business all these years, made himself wealthy and thought it could all be applied to his new job and work just as well.\n\nHe made a **huge miscalculation** and now the walls are closing in and he thinks some *miraculous* foreign policy achievement, or a massive growth in the economy or a large change in direction of our society would somehow save his ass.\n\nThat is what he thinks and he is dead wrong.'

'Eh, Trump supporters are actually a small minority of the country.

'They’ve cut out all of the useful help programs in most state and federal prisons. He won’t get help. '
"I tried but the man is a wind bag. Folks who like Trump, what is it that makes you feel to this day that he's capable of the job? You can like the policies but just fucking listen to him. He says NOTHING."
'More like an old man on his porch yelling at the neighbor kids to; "GET OFF MY LAWN"\n\nSeriously, ["The Meltdown will be televised"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Revolution_Will_Not_Be_Televised)\n\nThere was so much the world missed when we watched the Watergate scandal unfold and exposed. Nixon had the FBI neutralized by his man Patrick Gray, the CIA was asked to look the other way (they did not) He fired the Special Prosecutor, and we had at the time; no social media, no internet, no 24 hour news programs, but had a Republican party who had some outstanding and honest individuals. We had a Democratic party that refused to pull a fast one and get a Democratic President put in place as, at the time Watergate was exposed, Spiro Agnew had resigned, and there was no VP, so if Nixon was impeached or resigned, the Speaker of the House, Carl Albert, a Democrat, would become President. This despite the Republicans winning the \'72 election in a landslide over McGovern. The Democrats (who controlled the House and Senate), confirmed Gerald Ford, the Republican House Minority leader, to be VP, knowing full well he would become President.\n\nIt was true democracy in action.\n\nWhat do we have now? A couch full of vaporous talking heads, who  talk to the President of the US with softball questions into a first class meltdown on live TV.'

"Macron got in front of joint sessions and gave a real presidential speech, the likes of which we haven't seen since 2016, in his second language. It's pretty good you should watch it. \n\nEdited for clarity"
"Well what happened was that Macron [held a speech](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/25/politics/emmanuel-macron-donald-trump-congress-politics/index.html) in congress, highly critical of Trump's policies. Yet ol' Donnie was so enamored with Macron that he was [gushing like a schoolgirl](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6136166/donald-trump-emmanuel-macron-dandruff-white-house/).\n\nMacron understands how to play on Trump's narcissism very well, and Trump came off looking like an un-statesman-like tit who is completely out of his league.\n\nAdd to that some other [bizarre and awkward moments](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/24/politics/macron-visit-gifs/index.html) and the Presidential farce is complete."

"I really want Hillary to win. She isn't my first choice for who deserves it most, but by jove it would be so entertaining to watch Trump's reaction to Hillary dethroning him as Person of The Year!"

"The Taylor Swift subreddit has linked to the poll, but even there you can find people who admit that she hasn't really been particularly influential this year."
'We should at least be better than Taylor Swift. What monumental thing did she do this year? Get to work, team!'
"The good news is that some internet poll doesn't actually mean anything and the investigation will go on regardless of who wins. Although Putin winning would be sadly accurate "
'Even the Taylor Swift subreddit admits that she hasn’t done anything particularly influential this year, other than the groping trial.'
'If Mueller won, Trump would definitely fire him lol'
'I’m 100% NC with most of my family for other reasons but I have an older brother who I’ve always looked up to. He’s wildly smart, works for the government in water quality/health and I always saw him as a level headed person. Holy wow was I wrong. His Facebook page is like a diarrhea storm of pragerU shares, links to Fox News, and plenty of Sean Hannity propaganda. I just unfriended him and am now NC with him as well. Also deleted my Facebook so my brain feels better. 🤷🏻\u200d♀️'

'> how does Putin get away will this stuff if we all know its happening?\n\nWhat can the intelligence community do if the President of the United States is unwilling to act on their recommendations and you have a Republican-controlled Congress that is complicit?'
'Their recommendations would definitely be classified at probably the highest levels but they would certainly provide the President various technological and other responses.'
"Does anyone know of an intelligent republican subreddit where they might discuss this type of subjects?  I'd like to know from their point of view what they think about this. "

"Well there could be grounds for appeal but he's not doing this in a court room, he's doing it on Fox and Friends. "
"That's not a fair comment at all. There are a LOT of intelligent republicans. I know an absolute ton of them. However, most of them are wealthy enough that they support Republicans to protect their assets. They don't typically care (at least not as passionately) about the Republican positions on things like abortion or gay marriage. \n\nUnfortunately, the larger part of the Republican party are those who've been bamboozled into it by the promise of pushing their moral directives. They vote against their own economic, health, and other interests in the hopes that by vilifying the opposing position, they'll eventually get their 1-2 core issues legislated, and they do so completely oblivious to the reality that they're pawns for politicians who honestly don't remotely care about those issues, and often are the largest violator of those morals.\n"
'Most of the smart republicans I know swallowed their pride and voted Clinton, or else "threw their vote away for Evan McMullin or Gary Johnson, because they saw Trump for what he is. Very few have ever been on the Trump train or even tepidly supportive of him. \n\nAnd no, these are not independents. Most have voted straight ticket Republican for decades, still hesitate to criticize anything about Bush\'s presidency, etc. Several were delagates in the Republican primary (my state went heavily to Cruz, something like 70%). '
"The problem is we don't have a viable third (or fourth) party. If your primary interests are economic, you vote Republican. Many of them would probably be Libertarian if it were viable. Others would totally jump on a fiscally conservative/socially liberal or moderate platform.\n\nI totally get what you're saying though. I've had conversations with many of the smart Republicans I know, and they either use mental gymnastics to convince themselves that charity can fill the voids created by Republican policies, or they believe we should fund the social net by reducing the military (obviously dissenting from the R platform on this issue). However, they still feel more strongly about low taxes, lower regulation on their businesses, etc. \n\n"
"Absolutely. Trump was within his legal rights to fire Comey. His motivation is what would make it obstruction. Same thing applies if he were to fire Rosenstein in order to effect the dissolution of the probe. It's legal for him to do so, but the legal act may become obstruction of justice based on his motives."

You'd all be better served organizing all of this and keeping it quiet until you actually have something real to say. \n\nThese tactics used to work very well. Generally known as an October surprise. (October surprise is a news event deliberately created or timed or sometimes occurring spontaneously to influence the outcome of an election.) The event created doubt about the candidate. After the election, the story would go away. (Remember the recent Gloria Allred mess with the yearbook with the hilariously forged signature that included his assistant's initials?) \n\nAny road, the people who actually decide the elections are the 'undecided' people. Ironic that the people who break the 'tie' are the least informed, right? In the age of fingertip information, TV & newspapers have much less power to influence these voters. It takes almost no effort to do a little research on your own. Plus, it's been widely reported for years how dishonest main stream media can be. That said, the October surprise doesn't work anymore. Used to be calling someone a 'racist' was the coup de gr√¢ce for anyone. It's impossible to defend. Now the word of the day is 'pedophile.' People see through it now.

"A startling lack of trust with people on Twitter. We need to focus on the facts of the matter in the investigation, which is what this sub is about. I don't go to Twitter for my news. And it's not wise for anyone to be swayed by the popularity of a hash tag on Twitter. That's what the Russian trolls and bots tried to do first. Let's not feed the system with more bullshit."

I had just turned 18 that summer! \n\nBut I kept the copy of the sample ballot they give you to mark up, before you get the real one. And when I matriculated to Ca-Berkeley in the winter of \'73, it was a badge of honor, and in the summer \'74, I was asked by several other students if they could have it. LOL'

He'll flip, or if he gets pardoned by Trump that's when the Republicans who have just been on TV claiming the FBI investigation is valid will vote yes to impeach him.

"If that can reassure you, Mueller's office is purposely kept secret, and he has round the clock security."
"I honestly think that people might protest for a day or two. But will give up very quickly.\n\nI don't see any way that Trump loses this. The Republicans and their supporters just don't care."
'It will be good for ethereum and litecoin. Bitcoins growthrate is traditionally slower. '
'I‚Äôm fairly sure he‚Äôs planned ahead for it. Comey was intentionally disseminating information on the investigation throughout the FBI long before he was fired so the information couldn‚Äôt be easily destroyed. \n\nThese agencies hire the smartest people they can find, and Mueller is one of those people.'
"Yeah how is this not said more often? I'm starting to think that the GOP has gotten most of their funding from Russia for the past 10 years. Ratting out Trump is ratting out themselves."
"The alternative is he goes to prison. It's not impossible Trump leaves the Oval Office in handcuffs.\n\nPersonally I don't expect that. I think Trump leaves office, far before the end of his term, without any further legal ramifications beyond lawsuits, because he'll find some way to weasel out of everything. Rich and powerful people usually do. Most likely, pardoned completely by Pence.\n\nI hope I'm wrong however."
'Did anyone else read this like he said it with a russian accent ?'
"Almost certainly. Enough of them at least. If you're ever unsure if someone will follow orders, the answer is yes nine times out of ten."
"Our founding fathers did give us the Right to Revolution; the right or duty of the people of a nation to overthrow a government that acts against their common interests and/or threatens the safety of the people. It's just up to us to actually do it."

"This. Come on, guys ... *settle down*. Dozens of people take selfies with politicians every day. Doesn't mean they actually talked to them, let alone are a Russian asset.\n\n(FWIW, I hate Santorum's guts with a purple passion, but he IS still a patriotic American based on all available evidence, and I find the idea that he's a Russian asset preposterous.)"

Even though it's tilted to republicans, I still have faith that they would not allow our democracy to be completely destroyed because of partisan bullshit. I don't even think Gorsuch is enough of a Trump puppet to let that cast it's own vote. These people already serve for life, they have nothing to fear except from their own conscience. The only problem is the supreme court has no way to actually enforce their own rulings, and would rely on congress to impeach. You would certainly be signing your own career death warrant if the president was convicted of high crimes/misdemeanors by the SUPREME COURT then you decided not to impeach.    \n    \nI honestly think people are taking the speculation a bit too far on this one however. Why hasn't congress impeached him? There is an investigation underway. Even the dems won't fight for impeachment yet because they know it's not time. You only go for it when you have all your ducks in a row, and the process is underway to find out exactly where those ducks are."
"That's interesting. I was not aware that a US Marshall had that sort of legal authority on the President.  That authority may exist in theory but I would be surprised if they could pull it off without his cooperation.  Is the Secret Service really going to let the President be placed into custody for this purpose?"
"What you're talking about is arresting a sitting President.  There is much debate about that however he cannot be arrested unless he is impeached and removed from office (thus becoming an ordinary citizen).

Mueller is a patriot and won\'t play chicken with that on the line.\n\nThat\'s why the most likely outcome to all this is status-quo. Trump goes back to shady dealings. Feds look the other way on treason. And the music starts again. \n\nIf you\'re hoping for a "cleaning house" from Mueller, you\'re gonna have a bad time. \n'

'Not necessarily.  In a perfect world scenario it‚Äôs possible for FBI directors to have issues that prevent them from properly doing their jobs.  But I do not think it applies here.  There is evidence that Trump just didn‚Äôt want anyone investigating him, his family, or the campaign.  For the inept FBI director idea to be valid there would have to be proof that Comey and Mueller were not doing their jobs well.  If that evidence existed it would be public news.  \n\nAt best all Fox can do is misdirect, lie, and not present actual evidence.  This is why the nothing burger claims simply do not pan out.

They will continue to serve Putin until democrats are back in power because the entire republican party is complicit. They know what\'s going on but won\'t say it because "that\'s how we know we\'re family here, no leaks" ~ Paul Ryan.

It provides much better definitions of the actual differences between jail and prison than what I've provided.  They do, however, match what I said before.  \n\nJails are local facilities for holding for trial, short sentences (usually local or state violations), primarily misdemeanours but felons awaiting trial are mixed in.  Jails generally do not have separate facilities for high security/medium security prisoners.  That is generally handled in-house through segregation.\n\nPrison is synonymous with penitentiary.  These are post-sentencing facilities that are generally defined by their security level.  However, some prisons will include multiple security levels but held in separate facilities on the compound."

The fact that his team is comprised of people with CLEAR conflicts of interest. The Mueller investigation is a direct result of the Clinton email cover up. Corrupt elements at the top of the FBI and members of Obama's cabinet risked exposure if Trump took office unimpeded.

If they lie, cheat, and defraud the people, the people have a right to call a spade, a spade and choose a new leader.

'I don\'t know how much the Senate can do, honestly. They can "get back" at Trump in a variety of ways by going against him on legislation, or even an official statement of censure, but I don\'t see that deterring Trump.

Those pardons absolutely should be preserved. This is different. This is not normal. It‚Äôs different from every other pardon ever.'
'What if the courts got it wrong? Should a governor not be able to stay a looming execution in light of unquestionable exculpatory evidence when going through the courts would not be expedient enough to save an innocent life? '
"I'm not sure if he's setting up to pardon himself as much as he's trying to signal to anyone considering flipping on him that if they stick it out and don't cooperate with the probe instead he'll pardon *them*."
'A stay of execution to re-examine evidence is quite different than simply letting someone go free with no reason needed whatsoever.'
"And a majority of that 35% think it's a good thing and Trump should be above the law because MAGA!. "
'Its a little far-fetched to claim that a Trump supporter knows things.'
"History is written by the winners.\n\nI hate Trump as much as the next guy, maybe more, but for all the shots it seems like everyone on earth has taken at him, he's still standing.\n\nDon't be so cocksure.  "
'Yeah? What‚Äôs the weather like in Moscow today ? '

"Fucking this.\n\nMy country's filled with people who have progressive views that somehow thought Erdogan and Duterte did good job. Not to mention my parents that so often got duped by conservative hatred despite being much more pragmatic than i could ever be, not to mention they're still nice people overall.\n\nThe best way to stop these people to keep fooling themselves is to make people both more engaged to politics and more regulations to stop harmful news like Fox News and Breitbart. These people have almost no skill in technology, let alone the tool to distinguish good journalism and borderline propaganda, and even smart people can easily duped by propaganda."

'So the head of the SVR, Russia‚Äôs equivalent of the CIA, who is banned from entering the US, was allowed to come here and enter the country, along with the heads of the GRU and the FSB, the agencies responsible for meddling in our 2016 elections, to have a secret meeting with Trump appointed CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Trump appointed National Intelligence Director Dan Coats and others unnamed. And then, the Trump administration decides not to enforce Russian sanctions voted nearly unanimously to go into effect by congress. Coincidence? Kompromat?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4RIeL5VEGlw'
'Well, guys, we had a nice run, but America is done. Pack it up.'
'I wouldn\'t assume anything nefarious with Pompeo or Coats until proven otherwise.\n\nThey were doing their job. Trump is their boss. If he says "I\'m allowing these foreign diplomats into the country and want you to meet with them", that\'s what they do. I know Pompeo is a Trump ally, but Coats pushed hard to punish Russia over the annexation of Crimea. By many accounts, Coats was a Pence pick. Now, that may mean he\'s a hardcore Republican, but I don\'t think its fair to assume that he is involved based on what we know today.\n\nPart of Russia\'s plan is to undermine the public\'s faith in our institutions like the CIA and FBI. Lets not let them win by making blanket statements like this with no proof of their involvement in Trump\'s decision to forgo enforcing the sanctions. We know Trump and many of his closest allies are implicated, lets not start assuming everyone in the government or everyone with any ancillary connection to Trump is compromised. Russia wins when we do that.'
'Your post is what Russia winning looks like.\n\nHave some back bone. Stand up for what you believe in. 2 generations ago, its likely you and a large chunk of able bodied young people would be heading off to war over this. All you have to do is stay engaged, vote and not throw your hands up and be done with it. So grow up and get that done.'
"The America we knew is done.  This isn't unfixable.  We're fucking better than that."
'I‚Äôm not implicating any wrong doing on Pompeo or Coats. They simply could have received a message from the messengers. Or were delivering a message to the messengers. Let‚Äôs not shoot the messengers just yet. This meeting could have been about a lot of things unrelated to Russian election interference. But it‚Äôs highly unusual in the senior rank of the attendees and the organizations they represent, as well as the timing and the fact that they met wasn‚Äôt made public by the US government. However, we found out about it only after the Kremlin bragged about it to Russian Media, plus letting the head of the SVR onto the very US soil from which he is banned, had to be green lit by someone in the Trump Administration, and the timing with the decision by Trump not to enforce sanctions, makes the whole thing smell a little like man trough.'
'In what way would you be okay with our government officials meeting with the top coordinators for Russian interference in the election? '
"I really hope the 'pee tapes' refer to urine, and not **p**-edophilia like some folks suspect...we know he liked to violate female child pageant contestants by barging into the dressing room unannounced.  I hope it didn't go any further..."
'wow, i dunno how you guys come up with such high-effort, compelling posts.  Surely, *this* is what will stump the trump'
'In all fairness he rolled while alive too.'
'You misunderstand. I‚Äôm not okay with it at all. I simply don‚Äôt know the reason for the meeting. Could there be a legitimate reason for them to meet that doesn‚Äôt involve Russian election interference? Yes. Is that likely? No. I definitely lean to these two events being non-coincidental. (Please take note, this is my post. Check the username. I‚Äôm the person who connected these two events and spelled it out in the top comment.) '
"True, but the money laundering won't cause a change of heart in many Trump supporters. The idea that he's a sexual deviant who's been blackmailed by Russia in order to be more amenable to their needs will."
'Chin up. Never give in. Too many have given their lives for our freedoms for us to give in to this. We can do it. \n\nNo need to apologize, I just know this is part of the plan: exhaust the voting public with controversies to the point of giving up. We can never give up. I know Putin won‚Äôt. '
"I understand what you are saying. And I've been binging on these subs for some time. I've seen quite a few of your comments. I'm asking about the legitimate reasons that they could meet. Do you think there are possible legitimate reasons that they could be meeting?  You seem to say yes but that is not likely. What is an example of a legitimate reason?"

'He who lusts for gold is never satisfied by gold. I get you, the rich always want more. But who\'s gonna pay enough to make it worth it? Bill Clinton was paid by $500k by Russian Officials to give a "speech" after Hillary and Mueller sold enriched uranium to Russia through Rosatom/Uranium One. $500k for them is big bucks when you\'re a multi millionaire. When you\'re a multi billionaire, the price has to be substantially more than that to make it sweet. So who\'s gonna pay 5 mill? 10 mill? 20 mill +? And what exactly are they paying Trump for?? Build a case? There was no good reason for Russia to want Trump in office. They don\'t give a crap. If anything Russian would want Hillary since her and Bill and have already been making deals with them. Mueller investigation has gone on for a year now and there\'s zero evidence of collusion. His investigation is likely to end in the next couple weeks. Mueller asked for a 6 month extension and was denied. So what did Trump get paid for, by whom, and what did he do in return?? Seriously asking because I just don\'t see the pieces lining up. '

"The problem is that Mueller can't bring Trump to trial. The only charge that can be brought against a sitting president is impeachment, and that's done through congress, not the judicial system.\n\nI think Mueller is actually quite deliberate and intelligent in this: He's building a huge, undeniable case against Trump, with charges/convictions all around Trump, so that the house/senate will be compelled to impeach Trump. Remember, this is the only way any charges can be brought against Trump.\n\nSo yeah, Mueller will never be able to charge Trump with any crimes.

If an article is re-reporting an article from an original source, then it's rehosted. \n\nWe don't have this rule on /The_Mueller, so scuffling about it is of no value, and neither here nor there. The source rule applies to /politics, but on this sub, that's just semantics and doesn't matter. However, we do manage to post some articles here where the OP's headline is wildly editorialized. Might it happen that what OP posted wasn't really what is reported in the article? Yes, indeed, and reddit is notorious for having it's users jump off cliffs because they don't actually read articles, they only react to headlines. \n\nAgain, on this sub, it doesn't matter. The rules that apply to a legacy sub with millions of subscribers, ruls which have been worked out via long, hard experience, don't apply here. This sub was designed for Mueller memes. I'm glad to see it take a more serious direction, for it to become a real source of info, but if that's the direction it's going to take, we owe it to ourselves to be more accurate with headlines and postings. \n\n"

"Trump has so far given me no reason to trust him. He's given me plenty of reasons not to trust him. Like when he fired comey for doing light investigative work into Russia's, at the time, potential interference into the 2016 election. Then proceeded to start shouting fake news when they appointed a special counsel to get the job done. Now, if I was Trump, and I didn't collude, if have absolutely no problem with the investigation into me. Because they'd find nothing. Trump, however, can't stop acting irrationally whenever the water starts to get even a little warm. Oh Trump. Keep flailing like that, the chef will turn the heat up to max."

'There were plenty times when Obama was held accountable by MSNBC. Sure they lean to the left, and Fox leans to the right. The difference is that Fox doesn‚Äôt hold Trump accountable at all.\n\nThe investigation is less than a year old, and you say it‚Äôs deteriorating. How so?'
'Thank you.'

If the Democrats win and change leadership, chances of impeachment are 100%.\n6. Chances of conviction in the Senate are about 50/50 right now.

Then I hope you don\'t mind me asking clarifying questions on what is? Where is that line, what is the truth? \n\nOr is that not important on this sub because we only hate Donald Trump? As long as someone he knew had a meeting, or an interview, or a phone call, those would more clearly constitute collusion than say an actual dossier. \n\nNow that we are clear that I am curious.

'As I understand American campaign finance laws, trump simply took from campaign funding to pay hush money to these women. The funding was then cloaked by trumps personal business funds making it look like there was just minor moving of contributions through Michael cohens legal holding accounts. And campaign finance laws require that campaign funding be used to finance the campaign and not be used for personal or profitable gain.\n\nBasically trump pays girl with donor money (which breaks campaign finance law). Then Michael Cohen shuffles money in between personal and campaign money to cover up the mistake (which is basically money laundering and breaks campaign finance laws.)'
"All of Trump's actual lawyers would meet with him in pairs to protect themselves from him trying to lie about what they discussed. Since Cohen didn't have anyone to double up with it makes sense that he'd record instead. "
"I've got such a raging ~~clue~~ Lordy right now.\n\nOf course, nothing will happen to Teflon Don, but it's fun to imagine that Stormy would bring him down."

'You are completely wrong.\n\n\nThe allegation is that Cohen paid McDougal et. al. out of his own funds to keep them from influencing the election. This is an in-kind campaign donation, the same as if Cohen had given the Trump Campaign free taxi rides within the Five Burroughs.

This would make the timing of the payments so close to the election just an unfortunate coincidence.  However, RG has also said "can you imagine what would happen if this came out the week before the election?"\n\nSo if Trump is on tape alluding in any way to the importance of making the deal before the election then this is a huge deal.'

That idea is abhorrent of every good journalist and is something that is fundamentally drilled into EVERY journalism student over and over and over again. Much of the information journalists receive is false or wrong. It is your job to find the facts and report them.\n\nGood journalists chose their words extremely carefully. They are the stock and trade of the profession. \n\nLiterally minutes after her tweet and follow up, where she blasts Michael Avenatti for tweeting that there are more tapes, we receive reports that there are more tapes.\n\nHere is Haberman\'s tweet "Not sure how he would know what exists between Trump and Cohen, but that‚Äôs what we are referring to." \n\nWhy is she even tweeting this at all as a journalist? As a good journalist your job is not to criticize incoming info, but to shut up and follow the leads to see if that info is correct or not. Once you find out - using real actual facts, not opinion - you then report on what you have found. You let the facts speak for themselves. You NEVER state your opinion as Habberman did in this specific instance.\n\nHaberman acts very professional, but this incident alone should disqualify her from being a reliable source of information as a journalist. \n'

'I would say its inevitable. Firing Mueller would have zero effect on this case as Mueller is not prosecuting this case, but his office and either Mueller or his successor will receive the benefits (evidence) and a witness (Cohen) that can be pretty powerful against Trump, and he can do nothing, even the illegal promise of a pardon would not help in that it will ensure that some counts would be prosecuted at the state level. Even states have campaign contribution laws. However the evidence and even the venue may not support a prosecution of Cohen or Trump. I think though, the presecution of the abuse of the Taxi medallions, if they can rise to a felony level, will be prosecuted at the State or local level, although I am not sure of the penalties.'

"It's a counter intelligence investigation not a criminal and according to Mueller Trump is not a target. Why is Cory Booker lying? "
'Actually, Obama made **TWO** appointments to SCOTUS, Sotomayor and Kagan. The GOP Senate, however, denied him a third. by not allowing a Senate vote. Any SCOTUS appointee would normally recuse himself for a COI on any matter relating to the President who appointed him. You can bet that if any potential appointee who get to a Senate Hearing, that will be the no.1 question. I do not think though, that Trump will get enough GOP votes to confirm (he needs all of them) and if he waits until after the election and the Dems win the Senate, the likelihood of getting a SCOTUS appointment through the Senate hearing and to a vote before Mueller releases his report would be slim.'
"Garland did not get a hearing because Mitch McConnell, the Senate leader, did not schedule a hearing or a vote, especially for a Democratic Presidents choice..But Gorsuch had a hearing and a confirmation vote, it was early into Trump's administration and it was before the GOP lost a seat in Georgia and McCain was still voting., it was before the Mueller investigation and before all of his other bad choices. The GOP are down to a one vote margin, with 6 senators not willing to vote for just anybody, anymore.\n\nGorsuch was (is) a conservative Jurist, but not a Scalia and was even acceptable for a few Democrats considering what Trump may have chosen.\n\nMy point is that it will be very hard for McConnell to ramrod a Trump choice for SCOTUS through the Senate this time around. And the choice is against the clock as Congress adjourns in August, even though Mcconnel has told them to stay put, even the Republicans want some time to vet Trumps choices Should he not get a vote before September, he wont until after the election as some  Senators, GOP and Dems, will be leaving to campaign for their own seats in September to November. after November and if there is a new Senate Majority in Jan, Mcconnell will have one final hurrah, but most likely a contentious candidate will not have a vote."

'Oh he has *a lot* of sense. He hampers the investigation by publicly  criticizing the tactics. Tens of millions of Americans eat up anything he types on Twitter like gospel fodder. Past presidents have played the public to their favor for better or worse but Trump takes it to another level. Public perception matters sometimes even more than facts.'
'He might be psychologically compromised but definitely not an idiot.'
"Usually the Mueller team doesn't announce anything at all, even after the fact, but the Trump administration is a leaky sieve, so the Trumpsters who have meetings with the Justice League might talk about what was discussed in those meetings.

He doesn't even have any money that's not coming from his Kremlin Kronies."

Trump should burn regardless of whether or not the guy investigating him has a few black marks in his past. Trump is a blackened shit-stained mark on humanity and whatever can be done to prevent him from leaving a skidmark on the future can and must be done. '
"I'm not sure what your last sentence means.  Going through your post history, you're not American so I can't even see why you'd care much about this.  I do trust Mueller.

"In my personal perspective, the republications are wanting unbiased information that President Trump is involved. The Justice Department is ensuring they are doing a proper investigation and taking their sweet time. I'll wait for Special Prosecutor Muller to disclose publicly his findings. Everyone is innocent before proven guilty, even if he acts like a guilty three year old on twitter. I'm really trusting whatever the findings of the Muller investigation are. \n\nCan confirm comment about DNI.\n\nThe U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) is highly aware of home grown terrorism, state sponsored actors, and state threats. President Trump by attacking one intelligence agency with misinformation is destroying his credibility with all.\n\nAll intelligence agency's work together, and disclose information based on need to know.\n\nI fucking promise you nobody in the IC is falling for his bullshit on Russia."
'Technically yeah. Nowhere in the constitution does it say that elections have to be on the first Tuesday of November. It says that congress picks them. But moving them up would take the coordination of fifty states and hundreds of independent local election systems. \nBut yeah. You could. '

Also Mueller is conducting a massive investigation and may decide he wants to finish everything else before he moves on Trump.\n\nAll of the facts of the investigation *should* spell Trump's removal this year, but honestly, the above combination could very well drag this all the way to 2020.\n\nTrump is going down no question, and I do sincerely hope it happens this year, but we may be in for a *looooong* ride.\n\nMoral of the story?

That's literally the tip of the iceberg. "

Also strange that his "interference" didn\'t seem to interfere with anything at all...\n\nYoure being manipulated by a complicit media for a political establishment who\'s very survival is dependant on getting you to hate and fear Trump. If he\'s a successful president (and so far he truly is, by most objective standards) then what do you think that would do to the political landscape from here on out?

The preferred variety was originally the Gros Michel, which essentially became extinct by 1960, thanks to a fungus called Panama disease.\n  \n ***  \n ^^^I'm&#32;a&#32;Bot&#32;*bleep*&#32;*bloop*&#32;|&#32;[&#32;**Unsubscribe**](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=BananaFactBot&subject=I%20hate%20potassium&message=If%20you%20would%20like%20to%20unsubscribe%20from%20banana%20facts%2C%20send%20this%20private%20message%20with%20the%20subject%20%27I%20hate%20potassium%27.%20)&#32;|&#32;[**üçå**](https://np.reddit.com/r/BananaFactBot/comments/8acmq6/banana/?st=jfof9k8d&sh=acd80944)"
"Mueller doesn't leak. "
'Are any of you surprised by this?'
"Silly White House, public opinion doesn't mean shit as far as the Mueller investigation goes."
'He was hoping someone would fill in the answers for him.'
"I've heard it said that no good prosecutor asks a question without knowing the answer first. Pretty chilling thought for this White House."
'I think that applies in court (and applies to any lawyer) but asking questions like this at the investigation stage is normal for simply gathering information and seeing how the person answers the question.'
"Oh.  Hmm that's actually not that stupid.  Won't work on mueller though"
'all the evidence fit to be created, laughable.  '
'"Spokesman for the Special Counsel, Peter Carr, declined to comment."'
'Looking forward to the day he pleads fifth like the cartoon politician that he is.'

"The Republicans have proven that they're entirely complicit in Trump's targeted destruction of the US, its cultures, and its allies.  We have no choice but to remove them.  I gave to Heitkamp, Beto, and Bredesen.  Every little bit helps.  [Act Blue LLC](http://www.ActBlue.com) makes donating easy, and even $5 goes a long way."
'We all have to show up and vote though. I guarantee the MAGAts will. '
"Mike Pence has already sold his soul to the 43% that elected Trump, nothing will change. He'll immediately pardon Trump and Trump will basically run the presidency from the outside. Trump would probably even go through with his original plan to start his on TV network, maybe even spinning off Fox News opinion as Trump TV.\n\nThere's no happy ending here where Trump disappears, we're stuck with him for the next 10 years."
'This reads like a fucking draft pool. Alien vs. Predator. Whoever wins. We lose. Game over, man. Game over. '
"Even if the Dems win a simple majority in the Senate, they'll still be far short of the 2/3 super majority needed to convict. This is a foolish post no offense. "
"You can impeach Trump until the cows come home. But can America *remove* Trump? That's the real question this article hand waves away."
"I don't know about Pence pardoning Trump.  That's a complex question.  I do agree though that in one way shape or form we're stuck with Donald Trump until he dies."
'10 years? Dudes 70 something now. Hopefully he‚Äôll pass away eating a Big Mac.'
"Yeah, none of that is happening.  We just have to vote and make sure that everyone votes.  We have the numbers.  That's all we ever had to do.  But for some reason, Democrats keep trying to divert to a thousand alternatives to voting, and that's brought us where we are.  Just get everyone to vote."
"I'm well aware of the conviction requirements.  They will have to get Republicans on board to convict regardless, but it's far less likely to meet the required number if Democrats can't even get a simple majority."
"Maybe on civil stuff, they already are, but it's a stretch to think they have anything criminal on him. And if they do it better have been committed in a Blue state."
'I promote registration and voting. üëç'
'Definitely not a stretch to think they have crimes by him. '

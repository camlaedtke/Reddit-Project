And why would trump want to keep an old man when he can get a younger justice that could stay in there for 30 years? It would be stupid to pass up an opportunity to put in a new justice when the possibility of losing in 2020 or getting impeached is real.\n\nAlso it is possible trumps obstruction case may make it to the supreme court in which he would have to recuse himself anyways.\n\n> These conspiracies make zero sense and are embarrassingly-lacking in evidence. \n>\n\nActually they fit with everything that has been going on, especially deutsch banks shady loans that nobody else would offer.

After the election, the story would go away.

Ironic that the people who break the 'tie' are the least informed, right? In the age of fingertip information, TV & newspapers have much less power to influence these voters. It takes almost no effort to do a little research on your own. Plus, it's been widely reported for years how dishonest main stream media can be. That said, the October surprise doesn't work anymore.

'Agreed the millions are lost that could otherwise be put to good use . Now maybe Trump could golf less, like consciously shave 8- 12% off his golf time and then we might not feel the burn so much of losing a dozen or so million in money well spent protecting our Democracy.  '
"Melania was reportedly crying the night that Trump won the election and they were not happy tears at all. Well I think she dug her own grave by marrying this guy, she had to know who he was as a person, but in a way I kind of feel sorry for her. It doesn't sound like she's got much of a life at all living with this guy. Has anybody ever seen her smile like a genuine smile and not a model smile? She seems profoundly miserable."

'>The information has been transmitted by Deutsche Bank to the German Financial Supervisory Authority Bafin. They are also to approach the US special investigator Robert Mueller, who is researching possible security-related financial ties of the Trump clan - including Russia.'
'Well, if previous behavior is any indication, Mueller will take an interest in this, and if there’s substantial evidence of criminal activity, he’ll do the same thing he did with Flynn and Manafort: indict him and give him the choice to cooperate in exchange for dropping some charges. In that case, Kushner will sing like a canary. I don’t think he’s really that smart, but he’s a member of the trump family clan, so there’s a good chance he’s privy to any of Trump’s worst campaign transgressions.'
'Surprise!  Germans want to help democrats go after a Jew!'

'Sure comrade'
'Deal. And if it turns out the the FBI, DOJ, and other top officials acted illegally in obtaining FISA warrants to spy on American citizens you do an AMA on t_d and declare that you are a CNN/ WAPO shill. Deal? '
"I'm not saying that never happened, I'll wait for hard evidence on that. Trying to use this to try to discredit the Trump/Russia investigation is laughable though. Also, Nunes doesn't really have a track record of being the most honest person, so you'll understand that I won't just take his word. "
'What do I need? I need any evidence of Russian collusion. Any. Please. You referred to 4 indictments and 2 guilty please. None of these are related to so called "Russian collusion". None. \n\nMy neighbor was fined for not paying a parking ticket. Let me guess, that is proof enough for you. '

'So, the protesters are “paid” in food.  Seems like if you were sincerely protesting you’d come prepared, long term or not.'

"> I mean to say that Russia seems to care about sowing discord, not about protecting trump per se.\n\nTrump is their number one chaos/discord machine.  To some extent the damage is already done, but if they didn't care about keeping him in office they would've made the kompromat public by now."
"A startling lack of trust with people on Twitter. We need to focus on the facts of the matter in the investigation, which is what this sub is about. I don't go to Twitter for my news. And it's not wise for anyone to be swayed by the popularity of a hash tag on Twitter. That's what the Russian trolls and bots tried to do first. Let's not feed the system with more bullshit."
'Really? Because what it looks like you did is implied that I was somehow dismissing the Russia investigation as a whole because I joked about the poor quality of a popular show that was trending on Twitter. That would make my last response very relevant to clarifying that misconception on your part.'
'Fair point. Pizzagate did trend for a bit, after all :/'
"I guess I misunderstood. I'm still trying to parse this sentence you wrote (not trying to be a dick, it's very early).\n\nWhat I mean is that people pay attention to stupid shit.

I had just turned 18 that summer! \n\nBut I kept the copy of the sample ballot they give you to mark up, before you get the real one. And when I matriculated to Ca-Berkeley in the winter of \'73, it was a badge of honor, and in the summer \'74, I was asked by several other students if they could have it. LOL'

Had Hillary been president, same result. No, the Paul Manafort thing is about to happen on Friday, and I don't think he's ready for jail. He'll flip, or if he gets pardoned by Trump that's when the Republicans who have just been on TV claiming the FBI investigation is valid will vote yes to impeach him.

'Is there any way that Mueller is betting on Trump firing him? Is he prepared for it? Like somehow he has a backup plan? Fuck sakes I hope so.'
'This is getting pretty scary...'
"I don't agree with a lot of what Seth Abramson is saying about the reaction to Mueller getting fired.\n\nI just don't think we'll see market volatility or mass strikes.\n\nPeople haven't shut down DC over anything else he's done, why should they care about this?"
'This is frightening. We’re living in some dangerous times but we can not let this fly. Not for you, not for your current/future children or grand children.'
'"Further confirmation of this is that we don\'t hear from the media or Congressional Republicans any evidence—even claims—that Trump and his associates are innocent.

'It will be good for ethereum and litecoin. Bitcoins growthrate is traditionally slower. '
'I’m fairly sure he’s planned ahead for it. Comey was intentionally disseminating information on the investigation throughout the FBI long before he was fired so the information couldn’t be easily destroyed. \n\nThese agencies hire the smartest people they can find, and Mueller is one of those people.'
"Yeah how is this not said more often? I'm starting to think that the GOP has gotten most of their funding from Russia for the past 10 years. Ratting out Trump is ratting out themselves."
"The alternative is he goes to prison. It's not impossible Trump leaves the Oval Office in handcuffs.\n\nPersonally I don't expect that. I think Trump leaves office, far before the end of his term, without any further legal ramifications beyond lawsuits, because he'll find some way to weasel out of everything. Rich and powerful people usually do. Most likely, pardoned completely by Pence.\n\nI hope I'm wrong however."
'Did anyone else read this like he said it with a russian accent ?'
"Almost certainly. Enough of them at least. If you're ever unsure if someone will follow orders, the answer is yes nine times out of ten."
"Our founding fathers did give us the Right to Revolution; the right or duty of the people of a nation to overthrow a government that acts against their common interests and/or threatens the safety of the people. It's just up to us to actually do it."

"This. Come on, guys ... *settle down*. Dozens of people take selfies with politicians every day. Doesn't mean they actually talked to them, let alone are a Russian asset.\n\n(FWIW, I hate Santorum's guts with a purple passion, but he IS still a patriotic American based on all available evidence, and I find the idea that he's a Russian asset preposterous.)"

"I think Trump will refuse to be interviewed, even after receiving a subpoena.  There is no one to hold him accountable.  He can't be arrested or compelled to go anywhere inside the United States if doesn't want to.  That interview will have to wait until Donald Trump is out of office which will be at the minimum 2020."

"Well, we do have the supreme court if a subpoena is being ignored, they could hold him in contempt (I think, not a lawyer) but as everyone keeps saying, a lot of this is speculative as it's never been so bad that it needed testing. According to my high school constitution classes, there are three branches of government that check and balance each other and the supreme court would be on equal footing. Even though it's tilted to republicans, I still have faith that they would not allow our democracy to be completely destroyed because of partisan bullshit. I don't even think Gorsuch is enough of a Trump puppet to let that cast it's own vote. These people already serve for life, they have nothing to fear except from their own conscience. The only problem is the supreme court has no way to actually enforce their own rulings, and would rely on congress to impeach. You would certainly be signing your own career death warrant if the president was convicted of high crimes/misdemeanors by the SUPREME COURT then you decided not to impeach.    \n    \nI honestly think people are taking the speculation a bit too far on this one however. Why hasn't congress impeached him? There is an investigation underway. Even the dems won't fight for impeachment yet because they know it's not time. You only go for it when you have all your ducks in a row, and the process is underway to find out exactly where those ducks are."
"That's interesting. I was not aware that a US Marshall had that sort of legal authority on the President.  That authority may exist in theory but I would be surprised if they could pull it off without his cooperation.  Is the Secret Service really going to let the President be placed into custody for this purpose?"
"What you're talking about is arresting a sitting President.  There is much debate about that however he cannot be arrested unless he is impeached and removed from office (thus becoming an ordinary citizen).

Replaces Pence with a suitable interim and they all live happily ever after. \nIf americans knew the breadth and depth of the rot, they would be out in the streets with pitchforks and torches.\n\nTrump will most definitely double-down and put the Republic at risk in order to save his own skin if necessary. Mueller is a patriot and won\'t play chicken with that on the line.\n\nThat\'s why the most likely outcome to all this is status-quo. Trump goes back to shady dealings.

'Of course he fucking did, who is surprised by this at all?'
'Definitely good optics to fire the head of the FBI and then try to get the special counsel fired the same year.\n\nIf nothing else, more headaches for Republicans in an election year'
"I assume this is leaked by Mueller and it's a great time to do it with the thinking that Trump could actually really do this soon.  You know Trump, he will deny this...then what is he gonna do, fire him?  This seems really brilliant by Mueller.  It gives a bigger hit at obstruction is he were to do that."

"I'm a bit confused, the article says Mueller found out about it months ago during the interview. I know that he's building up a strong case, but why did he not act back then? This seems like something that would hold up on its own against Trump."
'Not necessarily.  In a perfect world scenario it’s possible for FBI directors to have issues that prevent them from properly doing their jobs.  But I do not think it applies here.  There is evidence that Trump just didn’t want anyone investigating him, his family, or the campaign.  For the inept FBI director idea to be valid there would have to be proof that Comey and Mueller were not doing their jobs well.  If that evidence existed it would be public news.  \n\nAt best all Fox can do is misdirect, lie, and not present actual evidence.  This is why the nothing burger claims simply do not pan out.  And that’s ignoring all the testimony Mueller has acquired.'

"See, I'm not crazy, self-destruct mode was activated before he got inaugurated. "

'that would be the united states of america!'
'pretty short sighted priorities... how long do they think they can keep it up?'
'I doubt that - if the republicans haven\'t brought articles of impeachment yet they\'re not going to. Donald drumpft is a traitor, Paul Ryan is a traitor, Mitch McConnell is a traitor, Jeff Sessions is a traitor - and Putin is their boss. They will continue to serve Putin until democrats are back in power because the entire republican party is complicit. They know what\'s going on but won\'t say it because "that\'s how we know we\'re family here, no leaks" ~ Paul Ryan. They\'re letting Russia dictate US policy, they\'re ignoring the president\'s numerous scandals that prove he is unfit for office, they\'re playing politics to protect a president who is actively engaged in a campaign to strengthen Russian influence in the US and undermine US interests.

In Britain the words are interchangeable.*** \n\nThe linked page provides much more clarification.  It provides much better definitions of the actual differences between jail and prison than what I've provided.  They do, however, match what I said before.  \n\nJails are local facilities for holding for trial, short sentences (usually local or state violations), primarily misdemeanours but felons awaiting trial are mixed in.  Jails generally do not have separate facilities for high security/medium security prisoners.  That is generally handled in-house through segregation.\n\nPrison is synonymous with penitentiary.  These are post-sentencing facilities that are generally defined by their security level.  However, some prisons will include multiple security levels but held in separate facilities on the compound."

The fact that his team is comprised of people with CLEAR conflicts of interest. The Mueller investigation is a direct result of the Clinton email cover up. Corrupt elements at the top of the FBI and members of Obama's cabinet risked exposure if Trump took office unimpeded. The Mueller investigation will find nothing because their is no evidence of Russia's impact in our election at all.

"Did this subpoena require a judges approval? I'm wondering how much of this request is general fishing and how much is targeted because Mueller already knows what he's looking for. I'm guessing mostly the latter."
'I don\'t know how much the Senate can do, honestly. They can "get back" at Trump in a variety of ways by going against him on legislation, or even an official statement of censure, but I don\'t see that deterring Trump. They could legislate a special counsel-type position for him, but that\'s a political non-starter because it would require the House, not to mention either Trump\'s signature or veto-proof majorities in both houses. Never gonna happen.\n\nI\'m not sure what other options there might be.'
'A grand jury, but not a judge. '
'On a related note, this New York Magazine deep dive was published just last night:\n\n[What if Trump has been a Russian asset since 1987?](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/07/trump-putin-russia-collusion.html)\n\nAnd regarding NATO Article 5:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_Treaty#Article_5\n\n>It has been invoked only once in NATO history: by the United States after the September 11 attacks in 2001.'
"Enough excuses. Trump must talk to Mueller. If he doesn't, we will impeach him for Obstruction of Justice. End of discussion."
"The US should reduce its contribution into NATO if others can't put their amount in.  This will allow for less spending on military and let us invest in other things. "
'China too would be loving this'

'Do you believe the Robert Mueller investigation is worthwhile and important and should proceed?'
'That is true. Theyve been funding projects across the globe to establish a new shipping powerhouse and they will be the worlds leading producer of green energy by 2024'
'Do you even understand how much security NATO gives us? Like do you really not understand what was the norm before it? 1. They dont stiff us out of $1trillion 2. Youre a fucking idiot if you think we pay for THEIR security and not ours'
'Leading producer of green energy by 2024. That’s quite a claim. Where can I read more about this? '
"Then you should understand what geopolitical advantage Russia might seek from a potentially compromised relationship with Trump, that the destabilization of NATO would be high on the list, and that Muller's task is to root out the nature of any such compromised relationships."
'I meant for the benefit of NATO members. That would be defending America after September 11. '
'It’s collective self defense. Ukraine wasn’t in NATO so it wasn’t protected (it did receive security guarantees for giving up its nukes though). \n\nAfghanistan was fought for American defense after 9/11, but Iraq was not. '

I agree that there is a significant amount of hysteria and people have seemingly concluded that Trump is guilty without any real knowledge of what Mueller may have.

He\'s still young, and it is certainly conceivable that if he stuck around long enough, he could be the GOP candidate for President.  \n\nBut at the height of his career, and just a few years away from a likely Presidential run, he decides to give it up to "spend more time with his family".

"I'd support ending it. I don't think anyone should have that kind of power without having to go through the courts."
'Pretty much all presidential pardons are miscarriages of justice. That’s the point. It’s done specifically to say “you’re guilty but you get to go free”. It’s not like a pardon from the governor, which can save a death row inmate before the switch wrongly gets flipped. It’s almost always for political or publicity purposes. \n\nTrump is trying to set it up so he can pardon himself. That’s an entirely different thing than anything any governor does or president tries to do. Governor pardons can often save innocent lives from being wrongly taken. Those pardons absolutely should be preserved. This is different. This is not normal. It’s different from every other pardon ever.'
'What if the courts got it wrong? Should a governor not be able to stay a looming execution in light of unquestionable exculpatory evidence when going through the courts would not be expedient enough to save an innocent life? '
"I'm not sure if he's setting up to pardon himself as much as he's trying to signal to anyone considering flipping on him that if they stick it out and don't cooperate with the probe instead he'll pardon *them*."
'A stay of execution to re-examine evidence is quite different than simply letting someone go free with no reason needed whatsoever.'

'So the head of the SVR, Russia’s equivalent of the CIA, who is banned from entering the US, was allowed to come here and enter the country, along with the heads of the GRU and the FSB, the agencies responsible for meddling in our 2016 elections, to have a secret meeting with Trump appointed CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Trump appointed National Intelligence Director Dan Coats and others unnamed. And then, the Trump administration decides not to enforce Russian sanctions voted nearly unanimously to go into effect by congress. Coincidence? Kompromat?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4RIeL5VEGlw'
'Well, guys, we had a nice run, but America is done. Pack it up.'
'I wouldn\'t assume anything nefarious with Pompeo or Coats until proven otherwise.\n\nThey were doing their job. Trump is their boss. If he says "I\'m allowing these foreign diplomats into the country and want you to meet with them", that\'s what they do. I know Pompeo is a Trump ally, but Coats pushed hard to punish Russia over the annexation of Crimea. By many accounts, Coats was a Pence pick. Now, that may mean he\'s a hardcore Republican, but I don\'t think its fair to assume that he is involved based on what we know today.\n\nPart of Russia\'s plan is to undermine the public\'s faith in our institutions like the CIA and FBI. Lets not let them win by making blanket statements like this with no proof of their involvement in Trump\'s decision to forgo enforcing the sanctions. We know Trump and many of his closest allies are implicated, lets not start assuming everyone in the government or everyone with any ancillary connection to Trump is compromised. Russia wins when we do that.'
'Your post is what Russia winning looks like.\n\nHave some back bone. Stand up for what you believe in. 2 generations ago, its likely you and a large chunk of able bodied young people would be heading off to war over this. All you have to do is stay engaged, vote and not throw your hands up and be done with it. So grow up and get that done.'
"The America we knew is done.  This isn't unfixable.  We're fucking better than that."
'I’m not implicating any wrong doing on Pompeo or Coats. They simply could have received a message from the messengers. Or were delivering a message to the messengers. Let’s not shoot the messengers just yet. This meeting could have been about a lot of things unrelated to Russian election interference. But it’s highly unusual in the senior rank of the attendees and the organizations they represent, as well as the timing and the fact that they met wasn’t made public by the US government. However, we found out about it only after the Kremlin bragged about it to Russian Media, plus letting the head of the SVR onto the very US soil from which he is banned, had to be green lit by someone in the Trump Administration, and the timing with the decision by Trump not to enforce sanctions, makes the whole thing smell a little like man trough.'

'In all fairness he rolled while alive too.'
'You misunderstand. I’m not okay with it at all. I simply don’t know the reason for the meeting.

His investigation is likely to end in the next couple weeks. Mueller asked for a 6 month extension and was denied. So what did Trump get paid for, by whom, and what did he do in return?? Seriously asking because I just don\'t see the pieces lining up. '

"Personally I hope they find Pence was involved so they can both be gone. I think he's been intentionally staying away to give himself plausible deniability because he believed it was inevitable that Trump would be removed from office one way or another. "

'Nate Silver says their pollster is actually a pretty decent pollster. '
"I'm surprised (but also not) at how damn quiet he is. Surprised because of how much Trump insists people defend him and yet Pence has gotten away with *not* doing so, not surprised because he knows it's only a matter of time before he becomes president and he needs to keep his hands clean. "

"Actually you got a good point on line 0-3, gonna keep that in mind.\n\nI'm still convinced with my theory, that mueller already got enough evidence to throw orange tidepod (honestly) into jail but he's holding back because he wants to come forward with ALL the evidence,including ppl around him."
"The problem is that Mueller can't bring Trump to trial. The only charge that can be brought against a sitting president is impeachment, and that's done through congress, not the judicial system.\n\nI think Mueller is actually quite deliberate and intelligent in this: He's building a huge, undeniable case against Trump, with charges/convictions all around Trump, so that the house/senate will be compelled to impeach Trump. Remember, this is the only way any charges can be brought against Trump.\n\nSo yeah, Mueller will never be able to charge Trump with any crimes. Instead, he's setting it up so he won't *need* to charge Trump with any crimes."

Now, if I was Trump, and I didn't collude, if have absolutely no problem with the investigation into me. Because they'd find nothing.

'As I understand American campaign finance laws, trump simply took from campaign funding to pay hush money to these women. The funding was then cloaked by trumps personal business funds making it look like there was just minor moving of contributions through Michael cohens legal holding accounts. And campaign finance laws require that campaign funding be used to finance the campaign and not be used for personal or profitable gain.\n\nBasically trump pays girl with donor money (which breaks campaign finance law). Then Michael Cohen shuffles money in between personal and campaign money to cover up the mistake (which is basically money laundering and breaks campaign finance laws.)'

Appears to be the only one. \u2066@nytmike\u2069 \u2066@mattapuzzo\u2069 and me" (sic)\n\nAs a former editor and journalist, using the word "appears" would be enough to get called on the carpet over. Rule #1 of any decent journalist is not to assume or claim something "appears" a certain way. That idea is abhorrent of every good journalist and is something that is fundamentally drilled into EVERY journalism student over and over and over again. Much of the information journalists receive is false or wrong. It is your job to find the facts and report them.\n\nGood journalists chose their words extremely carefully. They are the stock and trade of the profession. \n\nLiterally minutes after her tweet and follow up, where she blasts Michael Avenatti for tweeting that there are more tapes, we receive reports that there are more tapes.\n\nHere is Haberman\'s tweet "Not sure how he would know what exists between Trump and Cohen, but that’s what we are referring to." \n\nWhy is she even tweeting this at all as a journalist? As a good journalist your job is not to criticize incoming info, but to shut up and follow the leads to see if that info is correct or not. Once you find out - using real actual facts, not opinion - you then report on what you have found. You let the facts speak for themselves. You NEVER state your opinion as Habberman did in this specific instance.\n\nHaberman acts very professional, but this incident alone should disqualify her from being a reliable source of information as a journalist. \n'

'I would say its inevitable. Firing Mueller would have zero effect on this case as Mueller is not prosecuting this case, but his office and either Mueller or his successor will receive the benefits (evidence) and a witness (Cohen) that can be pretty powerful against Trump, and he can do nothing, even the illegal promise of a pardon would not help in that it will ensure that some counts would be prosecuted at the state level. Even states have campaign contribution laws. However the evidence and even the venue may not support a prosecution of Cohen or Trump. I think though, the presecution of the abuse of the Taxi medallions, if they can rise to a felony level, will be prosecuted at the State or local level, although I am not sure of the penalties.'

"It's a counter intelligence investigation not a criminal and according to Mueller Trump is not a target. Why is Cory Booker lying? "
'Actually, Obama made **TWO** appointments to SCOTUS, Sotomayor and Kagan. The GOP Senate, however, denied him a third. by not allowing a Senate vote. Any SCOTUS appointee would normally recuse himself for a COI on any matter relating to the President who appointed him. You can bet that if any potential appointee who get to a Senate Hearing, that will be the no.1 question. I do not think though, that Trump will get enough GOP votes to confirm (he needs all of them) and if he waits until after the election and the Dems win the Senate, the likelihood of getting a SCOTUS appointment through the Senate hearing and to a vote before Mueller releases his report would be slim.'
"Garland did not get a hearing because Mitch McConnell, the Senate leader, did not schedule a hearing or a vote, especially for a Democratic Presidents choice..But Gorsuch had a hearing and a confirmation vote, it was early into Trump's administration and it was before the GOP lost a seat in Georgia and McCain was still voting., it was before the Mueller investigation and before all of his other bad choices. The GOP are down to a one vote margin, with 6 senators not willing to vote for just anybody, anymore.\n\nGorsuch was (is) a conservative Jurist, but not a Scalia and was even acceptable for a few Democrats considering what Trump may have chosen.\n\nMy point is that it will be very hard for McConnell to ramrod a Trump choice for SCOTUS through the Senate this time around. And the choice is against the clock as Congress adjourns in August, even though Mcconnel has told them to stay put, even the Republicans want some time to vet Trumps choices Should he not get a vote before September, he wont until after the election as some  Senators, GOP and Dems, will be leaving to campaign for their own seats in September to November. after November and if there is a new Senate Majority in Jan, Mcconnell will have one final hurrah, but most likely a contentious candidate will not have a vote."

From the aftermath, it is glaringly obvious that the Trump Administration was counting on the Nunes memo in order to fire Rod Rosenstein. When the memo became a dud, the need for the Democratic response was null. Although in the interest of fairness they should have released it without delay. But Trump doesn't waste any political Capital that he has because he doesn't lose political Capital the way the other people around him do making the same decisions. His supporters are rabid."

He doesn't have any favors owed to him by people in positions of power in the US or elsewhere. He's no political genius like Kissinger with valuable advice and guidance. No reputation to exploit like Snowden; Trump's already embarrassed the West as much as he could from here, nothing to be gained by doing it in Moscow. He doesn't even have any money that's not coming from his Kremlin Kronies."

'No, my key word is "whataboutism". It\'s the classic move for idiots and losers. Whether or not the shit dripping out of your mouth is is true or not doesn\'t impact the investigation. Trump should burn regardless of whether or not the guy investigating him has a few black marks in his past. Trump is a blackened shit-stained mark on humanity and whatever can be done to prevent him from leaving a skidmark on the future can and must be done. '
"I'm not sure what your last sentence means.  Going through your post history, you're not American so I can't even see why you'd care much about this.  I do trust Mueller.

He's evil, not stupid, and he was a prosecutor himself, so he knows the law. This is to save his own ass, which is apparently the only thing that will stop people in the Trump camp from doing more evil."

'Just like he did right before the election.'
'He will definitely get the republican nomination. He is everything they’ve been dreaming about! Except that time when he said he would take away everyone’s guns and deal with due process afterwards. '
"No, as Trump was saying that the Republicans were defeating a bill that would have helped protect our election from Hacking.[[1]](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/07/19/us/politics/ap-us-congress-election-security.html)\n\nThe GOP *wants* our election to be compromised because they'll win, or if they lose they can do what the meme says."

"Oh I have. My Dad's family is from Missouri. I won't give up. Our country is at stake. Can't stop. Won't stop. I was on the Fox News Facebook page this morning telling everyone to read the Federalist Papers. \n\nWe need to hit their subconscious with Trump is a traitor.  "

"Trump didn't send her to jail like he promised?"
"Investigations were concluded. Also, had she become president I'd hope that there would be the same level of scrutiny in vetting illegal activities as there is now. Republican or Democrat, you should want justice regardless of if you voted for them. "
"The only good thing about trumps presidency is that the answer to this question stayed 'NO!'."
"Sorry, but the 'Russia narrative' is far from fabricated, you know foreign intelligence agencies informed the fbi, cia and nsa of these hacks since 2014. Americans get scary little information (and truth) from watching fox news all day, but you'll be surprise how deep the trump team was invested in Russia and how deep the reach of the Russians went. Every European country has a list of meetings with, for instance, kushner and Russian spies and investors, yet the only news you ever get is the trump tower meeting. That's literally the tip of the iceberg. "
'>Those FBI agents were fired six months ago.\n\nNope. Strozk and Page were. And thats after being on the investigation for a year already. \n\n>Comey was working on a draft of a statement after the bulk of the investigation was complete.\n\nBefore the investigation was complete. Before she was even interviewed. Your semantics doesnt change the fact. \n\n>We don\'t know what the draft stated because the whole thing was redacted before the Republican Congress released it.\n\nWe do know it exhonerated her before the investigation was complete. We also have texts from investigators explicitly stating they were going to go easy on her because they expected her to be president. And apparently shes quite vindictive. \n\n>If you can\'t see you\'ve consistently allowed yourself to be misled by the tweets of a narcissist who has already publicly admitted to interfering with the FBI\'s investigation, well I\'m guessing the eventual guilty verdict will not change your mind.\n\nI follow the facts. Not the narrative, as you seem to. Considering youre state hes a narcissist as fact despite zero proof of it. Your opinion is not fact. Also strange that his "interference" didn\'t seem to interfere with anything at all...\n\nYoure being manipulated by a complicit media for a political establishment who\'s very survival is dependant on getting you to hate and fear Trump. If he\'s a successful president (and so far he truly is, by most objective standards) then what do you think that would do to the political landscape from here on out? Its bad enough foe them that he was elected, but could you imagine how many career politicians would be out of the job once we realized you dont have to be part of the ruling class to be a successful president?\n\n'
"But  there is video evidence of him looking like a moron   in everything you just listed   soon you'll tell me he never said   what he said on the access Hollywood tapes.  Or he didn't  fire comey  who he previously  praised  and is highly regarded as ethical.      You are only a few  steps away from    Hitler never gassed Jews.   How can you not see this is the same blind shit  that happened the last time."
'Jesus Christ those texts were laughable, they don\'t ever talk about "going easy" on Clinton. They just want to keep their jobs if she\'s elected. Ironic yes. damning? Not even a little.\n\nQuoting trump directly:\n"You fight back, oh it\'s obstruction"\n\nAlso Trump already tried to fire Mueller but half his administration threatened to quit. Confirmed by everyone. Even Fox News.\n\nIt\'s funny though, this argument would have gotten me banned over at the_D, but look at you still free to float around this sub. That in itself says a lot about the culture of trump supporters.\n\nI\'m done. Feel free to respond with your last retort.'

"Langhoffer's letter to Congress states that:\n\n> TFA [Trump for America] directed the GSA to handle PTT data in a manner consistent with the MOU and the reported disposition of data from President Obama’s presidential transition in 2008; **computing devices were to be restored to original settings and reissued to federal personnel** and, to the extent that PTT records were not required for the winding down of TFA’s affairs, the PTT email archives were no longer to be preserved.\n\nBut I guess the question is whether the GSA guy appointed by Trump actually did what he was told."
'Don’t care if they were taken legally or. Or. '
'Nobody can be that much of a mob caricature and it just be coincidence.  If he acted like he does in a movie, the whole audience would be angry at the hero for not realising immediately that Guliani was so obviously the baddie.'
"Well, at least this is clearly meant as news analysis, reading significance into a sentence buried deep in a reputable outlet's story, whereas Mensch gets her scoops from the anonymous sources in her head.

"We are **NOT** the same as the st_D NAMBLA sub.  Some key points of difference:      \nWe don't ban dissenting opinions and can argue our points.     \nOur memes make sense and don't look like Nazi frog bullshit.     \nWe hold our subscribers/posters to a higher standard.  I've had my posts deleted for being too mean-spirited (Sarah Huckabee Sanders being compared to Uncle Fester, for example).      \nWe back up claims with evidence.      \nWe're self-correcting when we make mistakes (the Mueller Vietnam photo).      \nWe have awesome image tags we can post.      \nWe support justice and the instrument of that justice, Robert Mueller, whereas st_D supports corruption and lies.      \n       \nThose are some key differences just off the cuff I can think of.       \nEdit:  Now I realize what you were trying to say but you shouldn't call us a twin.

'I think they are too breathless and the stories are poorly sourced.  It is like the National Enquirer.  They are setting up people for disappointment.'
'I am unsure about the original reporting on the cellphones and laptops.  No doubt Mueller probably has gotten some information from laptops and cellphones already but if he had gotten a warrant for the physical laptops and cellphones we would have heard about it already.  The Palmer Report is associated with fabulists like Mensch, so the sources are likely not that good.'

'> I think they do, but obviously nobody has it all figured out, and politics is always up for debate.\n\n\nThat’s an agreeable statement, the problem is that most conservatives, the Republican Party, and Trump supporters aren’t interested in debate or discussion. They come up with phrases like “fake news” and attack the press and FBI when someone is critical of their ideas. For example this recent tax bill. It’s a horrible tax bill that’s had no debate or discussions on. It’s going to end up costing millions their healthcare and raise the taxes of millions who make less than $100,000 per year, all so those who need money the least get a “break.” Furthermore, when those who don’t support these policies point out how horrible of a bill is, Trump, Republicans, Ben Shapiro, etc. just call them leftist socialists. They are interested in discussion. The vitriol was started by their side of the political spectrum. '

'Yes, and the Postmaster General has said that package deliveries are one of the few areas where USPS is actually profitable. '
'How do deliver at a loss? I did not read the article wrong. Maybe you did. Here, try again.\n\nThat’s actually the solution right now,” former Postmaster General Jack Potter told The Wall Street Journal. “It’s well justified that they deliver those packages, and they make money on it.”\n\nWhile Trump has attacked Amazon for its use of the USPS before, its contract by law is reviewed and has to be profitable, CBS News notes.'
'Not according to Trumps’s doctor.

"Because many/most of them simply aren't politically informed. They get their political information from a very small, isolated group, rather than independent research. They accept the word of a single news source as Gospel, and take the word of pundits  as being researched and vetted, when the actuality is those pundits are blatantly twisting facts to the point of being propaganda (and the news source admits this by pointing out that they're political commentators and not news anchors every time they are proven wrong). \n\nWe could fix a lot of wrongs in our system with a couple legal changes for cable news networks.

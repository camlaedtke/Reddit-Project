“Donald Trump’s press conference performance in Helsinki rises to & exceeds the threshold of “high crimes & misdemeanors.” It was nothing short of treasonous. Not only were Trump’s comments imbecilic, he is wholly in the pocket of Putin. Republican Patriots: Where are you???” - John Brennan
This deserves to go Full Streisand. At the Trump/Putin conference, Putin said he wanted Trump to win. Next... 1) the White House cut that from the transcript; Next... 2) the White House edited the video itself; Next... 3) Trump declared that Putin is pushing for Democrats and "definitely" not him.
Two weeks before his inauguration, Donald J. Trump was shown highly classified intelligence indicating that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had personally ordered complex cyberattacks to sway the 2016 American election
We surrender! You’ve defeated T_D fair and square. Clear ties between Putin and Trump have been discovered.

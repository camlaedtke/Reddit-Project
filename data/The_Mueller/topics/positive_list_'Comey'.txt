James Comey, just now: "Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon. And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not."
James Comey subtweeting: "Applause is the spur of noble minds, the end and aim of weak ones.” - Edmund Burke (1730-1797)
FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe backed up James Comey's claims that President Trump requested his loyalty

'We are approaching true political dystopia is America. Gotta try hard to get these old fogies out of power.'
"Of course it is, and I'm afraid they might have a good shot of swaying low-information Fox types."
'I swear to god there needs to be consequences after this or it will most likely happen again.'
"Lol, yeah right.  But let's say you're right.\n\nHow does it feel when it happens to you? "
'They will still claim to be all those things because there is literally nothing worse than being a Democrat.\n\n>"Sir, should an accused pedophile hold office for Alabama?"\n\n>"Well, we certainly don\'t want a liberal Democrat in office..."\n\nThe president said that being a pedophile is nothing compared to being a Democrat. Let that sink in...'
'Then why hasn’t she been prosecuted now even with Trump’s FBI pick in charge? Why hasn’t Trump “locked her up” like he promised he would?\n\nCould it be because no crimes were committed, as Comey said?'
'Like how Trump’s family and team did?'
'Did Hillary Clinton have a security clearance at the end of the investigation?'
"Come on bro, they don't want to hear that Peter Strzok and Bruce Ohr had a back-up plan with Andy to undermine the American elections. Thank God for Mueller though, or we would have never heard of this collusion."

'GOP put party above EVERYTHING..'
'Also like half the Trump administration. '
'My first thought is this has to be part of a deal with someone in the GOP establishment. He pardons Libby, they do something to support him in the pending firing of Mueller or Rosenstein. The timing is too weird otherwise.'
'At this point does anyone expect something like consistency from Trump? Or fairness? Or truth? Or anything but raw self interest?'
'Anyone else worried trump may just pardon anyone that gets indicted by the special counsel?\n\nIf so, what can Mueller do?'

'Could be Bolton pushing him to pardon him. Trump barely seems to know who Libby is. '

'State charges, which are especially deadly if the guy is pardoned by Trump, since pardons require an admission of guilt.\n\nFor source, look at the Arpaio pardon.'
"He'll certainly try"

'That sounds like the one for lying.'
'Source? Not attacking you just curious '

"Yeah my brain didn't really register that first time through"
'Thanks but I meant do we know for sure Mueller is working with the state of NY for state crimes ?'
'Yeah check it out. It’s hilarious. '
"You would have thought he'd have learned from that time he asked Comey if he will go easy on Flynn is considered an order and is the reason why Mueller started his investigation into him."
"Trump is a huge reason why we need to stop giving the rich a pass in the court system.\n\nA millionaire accused of white collar crimes and with a great lawyer needs to be treated with the same hostility and velocity as somebody arrested for drug offences.\n\nTrump doesn't understand the difference between a Republic with due process and an authoritarian police state. The way he lives, he treats everybody he meets as though he's a dictator. And he's got lawyers to defend his whims."
'Basic security protocols? What about the part where trump holds meetings at mar a lago and people took selfies with the man holding the nuclear launch codes? '
"And still nothing will happen. I'm getting the feeling that nothing is going to come of any of this. We are all just watching the president commit crimes and embezzle money and nothing ever happens."
"I feel like he hasn't realized Twitter has doubled their character limit. "
'Wouldn\'t "actually" be a better word for the title?  '
'I love the open accusation of so many people put into so few characters to the point where he just sneaks people in at the end “also Comey and others.”'

You’re going to have quite the hangover when all’s said and done. '
"You keep using British references (The Guardian and the OED) to support your point.  Like I mentioned before, I am strictly talking about the US definitions.\n\nInternational Radio Journalism - Page 156 - Google Books Result\nhttps://books.google.com/books?isbn=1134863004\n\n>***Jail, prison The Americans make a distinction between jail and prison. In Britain the words are interchangeable.*** \n\nThe linked page provides much more clarification.  It provides much better definitions of the actual differences between jail and prison than what I've provided.  They do, however, match what I said before.  \n\nJails are local facilities for holding for trial, short sentences (usually local or state violations), primarily misdemeanours but felons awaiting trial are mixed in.  Jails generally do not have separate facilities for high security/medium security prisoners.  That is generally handled in-house through segregation.\n\nPrison is synonymous with penitentiary.  These are post-sentencing facilities that are generally defined by their security level.  However, some prisons will include multiple security levels but held in separate facilities on the compound."
'Except in the case of covfefe, in which case it was Trump’s intentional tweet, but you just aren’t important enough to understand. Enjoy!'
"You realize their is a whole contingency of establishment republicans who would love nothing more than to see Trump lose his office? Mueller being a republican matters about as much to me, a Trump voter and registered independent, as what Miley Cyrus had for breakfast... which is to say not at all.\n\nI'll base my opinions on the facts. The fact that his team is comprised of people with CLEAR conflicts of interest. The Mueller investigation is a direct result of the Clinton email cover up. Corrupt elements at the top of the FBI and members of Obama's cabinet risked exposure if Trump took office unimpeded. The Mueller investigation will find nothing because their is no evidence of Russia's impact in our election at all. And empty headed water carriers of an establishment on the way out will be crying when we finally get justice for the crimes of the last three decades of political corruption."
'You also have the worst presidential approval rating of any president EVER at the one-year mark. Enjoy that White House while you’ve got it. '

"When you look at the whole emails situation, and I say this as a registered democrat, it's obvious that bad, not necessarily criminal but bad behavior on the part of members of our party led directly to the email investigation, and then comey being more or less forced to publicly announce the reopening of that investigation. Comey is a victim of ugly politics and a good illustration of how important it is to play by the rules and how failure to do so can have unintended consequences. See also Andy McCabe.\n\nThe good news is that Comey played by the rules and AFAICT the guy is good as gold. And lordy there's memos."
'For daring to investigate emporer shitkek'
'Comey intended that the letter be publicized: he himself stated that in sending the letter, he believed that the American public deserved to be given an update on the Clinton investigation. Yet, for some petty reason, he didn’t bother to do the same thing on the greatest threat to our democracy and save this country. Especially when he was the person who knew the scope of the Russian interference more than anyone else in America.\n\nI hope in his book he holds himself accountable in his decision.'

'God, i hope McCabe will sue Trump and Sessions.'
"Why wasn't McCabe fired months ago, or even 18 months ago?  Why wait until just before he is eligible to collect his pension?"
"The way Trump celebrated it on his Twitter speaks volumes. That's how you act when you're gloating about getting away with something.

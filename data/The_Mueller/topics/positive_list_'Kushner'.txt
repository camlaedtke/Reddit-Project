'To be fair, the chief calligrapher is likely far more trustworthy.'
'Is the chief calligrapher responsible for the State of the Uniom tickets? If so...'
'But peace between Israel and Palestine, now how?'
'Soulless eyes, like a dolls eyes'
'Probably a better grasp on domestic and international politics too. '
'Maybe a greater net worth.  That’d be funny.'
"Son: I'm hungry.\n\nDad: Nice to meet you, hungry. I'm dad."
"Or for Trump: You can't transcribe the daily intelligence briefing into crayon drawings if you don't have clearance to read that text."
'Of course. Invitations to dinners, balls, various functions, placards, letters to foreign officials, cards, medals and honorific certificates...'
'Director of rooms...\n\n>Just checking the walls, dear'
"Well when you're hired for an important international position if you don't have access to the information your job is about you can't do it. Also, he's still on an interim, which is unbelievable considering his investigators already know he lied on his eqip form and it's been well over a year. If they even find out a regular Joe did that they'd deny his clearance in a heartbeat and he wouldn't be able to get one for a long time, if ever."
'And filling in security clearance application forms.'
'Domestic and international politics is actually also the name of his favorite pen.'
'I like how you’re getting downvoted just for saying you voted for Trump'
"He still got to look at the Daily Briefing: the most classified material the US has. \n\n\n> He wasn’t actually ever cleared\n\n\nAnd it's even worse that he was never cleared. I seem to remember someone running \t a presidential campaign on handling of classified material and a refrain about jail that related said handling. (That's Trump and *Lock her up!*). Now everyone is sticking the knife in about how the calligrapher has a higher clearance than Jared, forgetting it seems, that the damage is done. It's unreal that this even happened. Corrupt, unqualified son-in-law has access to the highest levels of US intelligence for over a year and when he finally loses the access he *should never have had and only gained through nepotism)* everyone treats it like a win. You're kidding yourselves."
"They had no reason to say it. It adds nothing to the conversation and looks like they're just fishing for upvote (for laughing at Trump even though they voted for him) or downvotes (for saying they voted for Trump)."
"And Corey's idiot friend Kyle. The kid broke his arm last week when he rode his bike into a parked car because he wanted to see how far he could ride with his left hand on the right handlebar and his right hand on the left handlebar. Nice kid, but not bright."
"This is probably a perfect metaphor for something related to the current presidency but I can't figure out what."
"That's actually very interesting.  But now I find myself wondering what Braille calligraphy would (or would not) look like."
'Yes, yes, yes... but apart from that, what have the Romans ever done for us?'
'It seems like Trump\'s followers are like that scene in Life of Brian "What has Some ever done for us?"\n\nOther than Manafort, Papadopoulos, Stone, Cohen, Trump Jr, etc... What evidence is there of conspiracy? None!!!'
'Sater is a piece as well. '
'You guys are still here? Lol'
'Show me evidence of Trump Russia collusion specifically and I’ll be happy to board the mueller train.  So far there’s been none.  '
'All right, but apart from the sanitation, the medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, a fresh water system, and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us?'
"You misunderstood 'Senior Advisor', 'Campaign Chairman', and 'Long time personal attorney and loyal foxer', clearly that just means coffee and errand boys."
"Sater turned FBI informative agent 13 years ago. So...I would bet he's been playing them. "
'surprising that the republican house didnt find anything and gave up so quickly.'
'Are you sitting on a grand jury? Then why do they have to show you anything yet? It’s an ongoing investigation, evidence will be presented when it’s ready, and if there is none, Mueller will say so. \n\nMost likely scenario is that Trump was insulated against any specific collusion but people around him will go down for a long time. '
"I would be interested in hearing a conservative voice on this:\n\nDo you know how long these types of investigations typically last?\n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/how-long-special-prosecutor-mueller-trump-2017-6\n\nI don't understand the conservative talking point of, 'this is taking too long'. Compared to what?"
"If I was rich enough to have my own fixer, I actually think coffee might be the #1 thing he spent his time on. I don't need to pay and threaten people to stay quiet about stuff though..."
"For some it's about wanting a strong leader in charge of things and who sticks it to other countries, not some wimp who goes around apologizing for our mistakes and talking through disputes.\n\nWell, that and some of them are just racist."
'Seems like a difficult way to go about things if you’re trying to play the FBI in the middle of all this. '
"Meanwhile they didn't say shit when we spent 4 years looking into Benghazi. Not a word. "
'It’s very suspicious but not exactly proof.  Our justice system is based on evidence and not how something makes you feel.'
"What do you mean? What does this post mean? What does this sub mean? \n\nHow I define it, and seemingly the law and Mueller, nothing has come to light, as been shown by the specificity of his indictments with regards to the charges. I'd love to know your definition though."
"I'd rather pee on him while he's alive. "
'So it sounds like Russia’s endgame is the destabilization of the USA, right? They worked with both sides at this point. They win if we fight each other, right? Or am I missing something?'

'What a coincidence that they find this now, now that the fusion GPS testimony is out and their integrity called into question. '
'>The information has been transmitted by Deutsche Bank to the German Financial Supervisory Authority Bafin. They are also to approach the US special investigator Robert Mueller, who is researching possible security-related financial ties of the Trump clan - including Russia.'
'Well, if previous behavior is any indication, Mueller will take an interest in this, and if there’s substantial evidence of criminal activity, he’ll do the same thing he did with Flynn and Manafort: indict him and give him the choice to cooperate in exchange for dropping some charges. In that case, Kushner will sing like a canary. I don’t think he’s really that smart, but he’s a member of the trump family clan, so there’s a good chance he’s privy to any of Trump’s worst campaign transgressions.'
'Surprise!  Germans want to help democrats go after a Jew!'
"Wow, that's the exact same reaction of a totally different person earlier in the thread, like word for word! What a very strange coincidence comrade!"
'Yeah, you should eat more of that fruit, it’ll help rid the country of your idiocy. '

'Sure comrade'
'Deal. And if it turns out the the FBI, DOJ, and other top officials acted illegally in obtaining FISA warrants to spy on American citizens you do an AMA on t_d and declare that you are a CNN/ WAPO shill. Deal? '
"I'm not saying that never happened, I'll wait for hard evidence on that. Trying to use this to try to discredit the Trump/Russia investigation is laughable though. Also, Nunes doesn't really have a track record of being the most honest person, so you'll understand that I won't just take his word. "
'What do I need? I need any evidence of Russian collusion. Any. Please. You referred to 4 indictments and 2 guilty please. None of these are related to so called "Russian collusion". None. \n\nMy neighbor was fined for not paying a parking ticket. Let me guess, that is proof enough for you. '
'As I said elsewhere this, uh, sounds pretty friggin bad. I don\'t think it bodes well when our leaders have a ton of stuff floating out there foreign nations could use to blackmail them. Even if I were a nationalist anti-Globalist or whatever, I\'d sure hope my "fuehrer" wasn\'t dancing to the tune of any random foreigner with dirt on him.'
'Well now the Qataris have compromat on several Trump folks. This sucks any which way you care to consider it. '

'pretty short sighted priorities... how long do they think they can keep it up?'
'I doubt that - if the republicans haven\'t brought articles of impeachment yet they\'re not going to. Donald drumpft is a traitor, Paul Ryan is a traitor, Mitch McConnell is a traitor, Jeff Sessions is a traitor - and Putin is their boss. They will continue to serve Putin until democrats are back in power because the entire republican party is complicit. They know what\'s going on but won\'t say it because "that\'s how we know we\'re family here, no leaks" ~ Paul Ryan. They\'re letting Russia dictate US policy, they\'re ignoring the president\'s numerous scandals that prove he is unfit for office, they\'re playing politics to protect a president who is actively engaged in a campaign to strengthen Russian influence in the US and undermine US interests.

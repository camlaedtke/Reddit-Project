Trump actually just said this: the Russian lawyer/spy who met with Trump Jr., Kushner, Manafort at Trump Tower -- she wasn't a spy at the time, and only became a spy recently, to make him look bad. He really just said that.
Remember how Tom Arnold said he had a tape of Trump on the set of The Apprentice, but then stopped talking about it? Turns out Keith Davidson (Stormy Daniels' first lawyer who supposedly represented while also conspiring with Michael Cohen) was also involved with silencing Tom Arnold.

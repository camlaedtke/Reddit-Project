Trump actually just said this: the Russian lawyer/spy who met with Trump Jr., Kushner, Manafort at Trump Tower -- she wasn't a spy at the time, and only became a spy recently, to make him look bad. He really just said that.
Trump/Russia Collusion is obviously #FakeNews if you simply ignore: Michael Cohen, Michael Flynn, George Papadopoulos, Jared Kushner, Michael Caputo, Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Donald Trump Jr., Carter Page, Jeff Sessions, J.D. Gordon, Rick Gates, Erik Prince (bonus: Sam Clovis)
Deutsche Bank finds evidence of dubious business of Trump's son-in-law Kushner (german)
Deutsche Bank is willing to report Jared Kushner’s "suspicious transactions" to Robert Mueller, report says
'Does anyone else look at Kushner and think he’s probably a drag queen on the weekends? I think its his eyebrows. 🤔'
"No, it's a person who writes things really fancy, but that's not important right now."
'At least it isnt the same old "nothin gburger" horseshit, but come on.\n\nConservative tribune? Fuggin propaganda site.'
'I’d still want to see the words. Unreadable calligraphy is more useless than printing documents that are possible to read in comic sans.'
"Is this a full-time gig? Pay well? I'm a little disappointed my guidance counselor did not mention this vocation to me..."
'>Please argue against the facts,\n\nIf only you had any to present\n\n'
'Just because you aren’t dispatiinate enough to recognize propaganda does not invalidate the point that there is only propaganda-not facts - on the site which you linked. '
'Never heard of em, must have been low level coffee runners to the most caffeinated staff in history'
'Which Witch is Which?'
"How am I supposed to ignore  Michael Cohen, Michael Flynn, George Papadopoulos, Jared Kushner, Michael Caputo, Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Donald Trump Jr., Carter Page, Jeff Sessions, J.D. Gordon, Rick Gates, Erik Prince and Sam Clovis.\n\nWhat's *your* secret?\n\nI want to get back to worrying about our imminent extinction already!"
'Must just be waiting to arrest Trump.'
"Buddy, it's not about the candidates or the issues, or the morals, or the family values, or the guns, or the weed, or any of that shit man....\n\nIt's about 3 things:\n\n1. The (R)\n\n2. Lower taxes (because greedy fuckers)\n\n3. Abortion.\n\nThey will vote for Hitler himself if he comes running as a republican, promising to end abortion, and lower taxes.\n\nIf that Hitler then goes and starts bombing Israel these voters won't even know about it. They don't care."
'At the very least conspiracy to commit treason.'
"That's a mouthful. How about ISoHFAtSoD?\n\nI was expecting a terrible acronym, but I So Fat Sod isn't that bad."
'>There is only power and those to weak to see it.\n\nThank you for this Harry Potter reference.'
'Both sides met to discuss getting a deal made.   Both sides claim no deal was made, but both sides got what they wanted out of the deal.    The outcome alone makes it obvious.   Especially when Trump asked Russia to release the emails on national TV.   That’s not a miraculous coincidence when they met to discuss the exact same goals.'
'Tell me why you think that with all these people associated with Trump, colluding with Russia, how is Trump somehow innocent?'
'My favorite part is that if Trump didn’t exist, these guys would all be going to jail anyways. Shady ass motherfuckers.\n\nPlus, we should all make it a point to dance on Eric Prince’s grave. '
'He is a puppet who jumped at the opportunity to be important while his cohorts rob the country blind. '
'I remember back in the day when you didn’t have to use /s for saying obviously ridiculous things on Reddit. After the rise of T_D it’s almost mandatory.'
"you should read Hitcher's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. Predicted the Trump presidency like 50 years ago, just not by name. President is just a distraction from the real work of governing, and the more trouble they get into, the better."
'Classic anti-intellectual behavior. Openly mocking people who aren’t afraid to challenge your narrow-minded views rather than listening to them and engaging them in thoughtful conversation is straight out of the fascism handbook. \n\nBetter get off the internet before you miss tonight’s book-burning. I heard they’re burning the entire history of the FBI tonight. I’d hate for you to miss that. '
'Weird kinda like the Senate did under Bill Clinton when he lied in sworn testimony and perjured himself.'
'Yet, the title of this post implies that it is clear cut and obvious that there is no need for a grand jury because he is guilty of collusion. One has to "ignore" all the evidence to believe he is not already guilty... Makes your tone a little strange here.'
"Nah, it's still and always been show me evidence of Trump colluding with Russia. Flynn talking to a Russian AFTER Trump was elected doesn't meet the standard. Manafort/Page working with Podesta in Ukraine in 2012 doesn't meet the standard. 13 Russian memers spending $2.5 million on Facebook posts that actually worked for and against both sides with a company that didn't exist at the time doesn't meet the standard... I'm just still waiting. "
'Not reading this incoherent nonsense.  '
'sad times for American history books'
'Bad bot'
"That's not a nice thing to say to anyone"
'And an insult! :-)'
"It's scary. Even scarier when you realize just how much of the plan has come to fruition. "
'Why is this getting freaking downvoted? Because political lit puts me to sleep? Jesus you guys are a little too hard core. '
'Same Deutsche Bankthat made teh news yesterday? \n[Trump Administration Waives Punishment For Convicted Banks, Including Deutsche — Which Trump Owes Millions](http://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/trump-administration-waives-punishment-convicted-banks-including-deutsche-which)\n\nIronically, the same pic is used.'
'I. Am. Shocked. 😧'
'Dubious? wtf'
'What do you mean? The fusion GPS testimony seems to indicate they suspect money laundering from russian sources through trumps real estate holdings.  Wouldnt looking at his and his close associates banking be the most logical next step?'
'This whole "investigation" is fruit of a poisonous tree. '
'Same bank, but that story is a dud.  It was a continuation of an Obama-era policy.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/7qsj5u/what_we_learned_in_the_russia_probe_week_of_jan_7/dssvogv/'
'I don’t know. More dirt comes out everyday, and everyday we forget what happened yesterday. '
"Of course it's the next logical step, but it's not like this has been some sort of secret to Deutsche Bank that they *just* learned about last night, and miraculously found evidence of this morning."
'Wtf makes you think Deutsche Bank ever had integrity? '
'So its outed that Simpson pointed them toward Deutsche bank and them releasing to the public that they found doubious activity makes it suspicious.  Not following the logic here.  '
"Qatar aren't so squeaky clean themselves. For a start, I know the way they 'gathered' the evidence will have been through the use of questionable methods. "
"Because being a Republican is a religion now. It's a belief system. And they have faith.\n\nAnythung else is heresy and you're a pagan if you disagree or believe anything else. "
'That has exactly how mafia crime families operate. '
"Maybe they just don't want to be screwed again?"
"There is literally no way they're doing that"
'Honestly, the only altruistic anecdote of Trump that i ever read was him helped some people loan because they fixed his car in nowhere road. But his behavior and other stories made me very doubt the authenticity.'
'Until Cheeto is not longer useful. '
'They also know that the election was fraudulent, and are all in on keeping that from ever being proven. '
"It's a risky calculus; they longer they wait to throw him out, the more agenda they get to ram through, but the more long term political damage he does to them. They're trying to shoot the fucking moon AFAICT. I mean wouldn't Pence be MORE useful at this point? Or maybe right after the midterms? Or do they honestly think Drumpf is getting a 2nd term? Or maybe they're scared of what will come out on Pence et al if they impeach Drumpf? He's really an albatross around their neck."
'I’ve got some bad news for you if you think Russian hookers get paid particularly well.'
"Look, I hope you're right, and I do think it's going to get worse before it gets better.  I'm just saying that any thinking person has more than enough to come to the conclusion *right now* that not just Trump, but the entire GOP has been compromised by this mess.\n\nI personally think Trump will lose the next election if he makes it that far so long as the Democrats don't pick a walking SNL caricature or a person with ethics problems that dampen enthusiasm.\n\nI'm just saying that I'm concerned that the current partisan equilibrium is not being changed by the facts that we already know, so why should more facts matter?  I fear this will continue to be an enthusiasm game rather than an objective assessment of who is good for America."
'**Demagogue**\n\nA demagogue  (from Greek δημαγωγός, a popular leader, a leader of a mob, from δῆμος, people, populace, the commons + ἀγωγός leading, leader) or rabble-rouser is a leader in a democracy who gains popularity by exploiting prejudice and ignorance among the common people, whipping up the passions of the crowd and shutting down reasoned deliberation. Demagogues overturn established customs of political conduct, or promise or threaten to do so.\n\nDemagogues have appeared in democracies since ancient Athens. They exploit a fundamental weakness in democracy: because ultimate power is held by the people, it is possible for the people to give that power to someone who appeals to the lowest common denominator of a large segment of the population.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'
'Ive never heard anyone on TV make the following point:\n\n\nIf he is so open minded about who was responsible for stealing the emails, like when he says "it could have been china, or a 400 lb guy in a basement", then why is it that that day he asked Russia and only Russia to produce the missing emails?\n\nWhy now he is always in need to muddy the waters with the "it could have been anyone" objection, when that day he adressed Russia diectly and explicitly?\n\n'

'I swear you can almost watch him realize that it\'s more convincing to claim it could be anyone during that interview. He steals it right from Katy Tur and every mention from then on is all "who knows who leaked the emails right?"'

"> It doesn't matter if he was directly involved or not, he has money invested into Reddit, which means they may be influenced at some level to keep that subreddit running amok.\n\nThe problem is assuming that just because the guy has the last name of Kushner that he is a supporter of Trump, when it's the exact opposite. This guy has no ties to the trump organization. If anything the influence would be exerted in the opposite direction."
'I wasn\'t attempting to say any of that, I want people to realize stuff like this is the liberal version of what T_D does.

"> Kushner’s business interests are generally family business interests\n\nThat isn't true. My business isn't my brothers business. Neither is the Kushner's.

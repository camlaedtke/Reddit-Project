Trump ‘venting’ about deputy AG Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller: ‘Let’s fire him, let’s get rid of him.’
Trump actually just said this: the Russian lawyer/spy who met with Trump Jr., Kushner, Manafort at Trump Tower -- she wasn't a spy at the time, and only became a spy recently, to make him look bad. He really just said that.
Erik "Real Life Bond Villain" Prince lied to Congress to hide his now-revealed (thank you, New York Times!) traitorous meeting in Trump tower with Don Jr. and agents from Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Israel. Way to go, Republican party! #basta

Giuliani: Trump fired Comey because he wouldn't tell Trump he wasn't target in Russia probe
"Where has Giuliani been recently? Apart from the Iran regime change stuff, I haven't heard him saying anything crazy for a few weeks."
"Considering the day after the meeting Trump was stating he will soon have dirt on Hillary's emails, proves he knew.\n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-jr-hillary-clinton-russia-email-press-conference-dirt-democratic-us-president-election-a7836826.html"

"It's treason, then."
"Cohen and Nunberg are flipping because they're scared shitless.\n\nGiuliani is just randomly running his mouth on live TV again without realizing that he totally shouldn't be admitting these things."
'Everybody around him is dealing with the Russians but he has absolutely no clue?'
"NO COLLUSION!  Just secret meetings that everyone lies about and were totally all about adoptions if they did occur. And that Joke about Russia If You're Listening afterwards was just a Joke. No collusion."
'You mean to say trump is a liar? Well I’d never! '
'Of course he did.  Donald Trump is guilty.  Hes not the guiltiest because hes not even the guiltiest named Donaled Trump.  But hes guilty of everything.'

"Cohen doesn't give a fuck anymore. It doesn't even seem like he wants a pardon. Trump fucked the one person that COULD have kept him out of impeachment/resignation/prison."
"Time to impeach was last year, now we are finding out Russia hacked the GOP and the DNC primaries, Putin has emails from most of the GOP Congress critters, that's why we have not seen any impeachment, not matter what proof is in front of them."
'It\'s fairly easy to pinpoint the exact moment when Trump decided to run for President: you can see it on his face at 1:19 in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eJpWOY3r18) of the 2011 White House Correspondents\' dinner.  You can practically hear the thought as it enters his mind and coalesces: "this man dared to mock me for slandering him, and I\'m going to destroy his legacy at all costs...though, preferably while golfing and raking in cash from the American taxpayers." '
"Trump has been talking about running for president since like 1988. He actually ran in 2000 and got some votes. He talked about running for 2012 and even made an announcement in 2011 that he wasn't going to run. Why is he lying now .. ? This is really weird. "
'Timing makes sense, it was right after Obama hurt his feelings at the WHCA dinner.'
'Man, people really hate the Cheeto! \n\nThe "scholarly" type here say theres no chance of him going to jail, just impeached. But i\'m gonna go out on a limb and say theres a chance'
"Trump's a fucking liar and he will reap what he's sown. Remember when Trump was #1 Birther? Russian Collusion will haunt Trump until he's impeached, and the years he gets to spend in federal pokey because of it. I just hope all the motherfuckers in congress that are conspiring to obstruct justice get thrown in prison, too. "

"It's got conspiracy, it's what republicans crave."
'It would be pretty difficult to deny it at this point. The only open question is: is he a stooge, a dupe, or an agent?'

Kennedy has been on the Court for almost 30 years and has been a rumored retirement since W. If Trump had Kennedy by the balls, why would he force him to retire instead of, idk, using that leverage to get Kennedy to keep making decisions that benefit the Dotard? These conspiracies make zero sense and are embarrassingly-lacking in evidence. \n\nThink critically ffs. I know everyone here wants to buy into any narrative that makes Republicans sound corrupt, but this theory is ridiculous.'
'The GOP are lying, hypocrite, scumbag pieces of shit but you know what......THEY ARE WINNING.     \n\nWhen they go low, we go high and get our asses kicked.'

"The best part is, a lot of those questions Mueller probably already has the answers to, from grilling all the people he has indicted. And every time Trump lies, it's a felony charge."
'I\'ve started coming up with my own conspiracy theories and really want to share. Can you guys critique this one for me before I take it to CNN? \n\nDuring the meeting with the FBI, Devin Nunes and Co were allowed to listen to the bombshell evidence of Trump Jr committing treason on tape. They could not figure out a single way to spin this in a positive light, and rightly assumed that informing the president of his son\'s likely incoming indictment would help in absolute no way. So they said nothing. Trump, watching Fox News 24/7, noticed this and ordered Rudy to state on air that they will only agree to an interview if Trump was allowed to review the information seen in that meeting. Mueller, because he\'s not a sucker, probably either refused to respond or told him something far less important.\n\nTrump, now feeling like people are "getting over on him", starts seething in rage and unleashing a legendary stream of crazy tweets. Melania clearly noticed something was wrong, and brought him his favorite meal: Well-done Filet Mignon with Ketchup with a side of doritos. Trump cut into the steak and saw that, once again, his pathetically worthless wife served him meat that was slightly pink. Tired of her shit, he threw her on the floor and whaled on her kidneys. She was then sent to the Emergency Room, where she quietly filled out divorce papers-- knowing full well that the pre-nup and NDA Michael Cohen had her sign prevented the truth from coming out, and allowing Trump\'s team to make up whatever bullshit story they wanted about what happened. When they did, she silently dropped a hint on her twitter page that she was fleeing the white house and returning to NYC.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Sure it\'s a bit nutty but it\'s not like I\'m saying he was born in Kenya or something.'
"Sounds like they've got them dead to rights, just need to let due process work its way through. (I hope)"
'Please indict this Ass Clown already.'
"At this point in time Nunes just has to be considered a traitor to democracy.  It's also time for him to get trumps tiny little dick out of his mouth."
'Every modern democratic country has court over congress..\n\nWhat I cannot comprehend is why court does not give warning to any individual or party if they spread lies?\n\nSaying loudly a false claim is good to damage, when claim is falsified majority would say conspiracy or might not even come to know about it.\n\nWhy is public speaker not accountable for things they say? '
"I wish, but i'm also cynical. "
"I know he's probably only a jack-ass, but I hope Mueller  has something on fucking piece of shit Nunes."
'People so easily forget that, back when the investigation started, Devin Nunes recused himself because he had a undisclosed personal investment in seeing the investigation fail'
"Unfortunately, I don't think anyone could be prosecuted for leaking classified stuff to the president. He is the ultimate source for classification and declassification. He probably doesn't know that though."
"> **Congress shall make no law** respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or **abridging the freedom of speech**, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.  \n  \n-United States Constitution, Amendment 1 (emphasis mine)  \n  \nTo ask the courts for a remedy, you would have to prove that the speaker did actual harm to you. In this case, it would be proving that Nunes' lies obstructed the functioning of the US Government and that it did actual harm to you, personally (not general harm). No court would take that argument seriously."

'More fake dossiers huh guys?  Paid for by anyone other than the dnc and Crooked Hillary this time?'
'Porque no los dos?'
'Or maybe (most likely) this is just more fake news BS, made up by CNN.'
"Mueller can do more for him than Trump can. Trump can't do anything about state charges, and pardoning him for federal crimes will very likely damn him for related State crimes."
'Ultimately it probably doesn’t matter that much. Mueller most likely already has a ton of evidence against Trump (and everyone else). If Cohen flips, there will just be that much more evidence but Mueller has them both dead-to-rights at this point. Still, on a psychological level, it’d be amazing if Cohen flipped; President Bonespurs would lose his shit. '

"The book may be all exaggerated or made up horseshit, and I'd be inclined to not believe any of it. But nobody reacts this aggressively to something that's completely false. "

'I guess we learn now if there truly is no such thing as bad publicity.'
'So I read the excerpt in New York magazine, and I’m worried that it’s an unsubstantiated narrative. If the sources aren’t verified, and evidence shown to back up some of the more extraordinary claims, then it’s just going to be more fuel to aggravate us. I want there to be some real useful evidence here that will have real consequences for Trump and his goons. Otherwise it’s just more circle jerk.'
'So Trump Jr meeting with a Russian lawyer who had dirt on HRC= collusion.  \nDNC paying a spy to come up with an unverified dossier which the Obama administration used as an excuse to get a warrant to spy on the opposing campaign= meh\nThis is why the left is insane. '
'The threats were asking wolff to pull the book. Instead of pulling the book he moved up the release date. Therefore it was moved up despite threats. Additionally he knows that all the media surrounding it will boost sales so it is also to take advantage of threats.'
'It has no effect on him'
'The lady doth protest too much, methinks.'
"Honestly at this point.... I think just like it's really hard for the onion to lampoon the insanity, i suspect it's hard to exaggerate the trump administration "
"They're certainly going to make the argument that it's libel. To do that, though, they'll need to prove that Wolff published the statements either knowing they were false or with reckless disregard for their truth. "
'And since he swore an oath to uphold the constitution doesn’t this mean he has broken that oath, thus should be removed from office. '
'Most of them knew they were being recorded. A lot of the White House staff were too stupid to confirm the interviews were off the record — they just assumed. This is what happens when you don’t know what you’re doing dealing with the press. '

'They will, it’s called prior restraint, but it’s extremely limited. You’re right that this is posturing but just FYI there are extremely limited circumstances where a court could grant an emergency injunction (that would most likely get overturned on appeal). But the real reason his lawyers won’t actually file a case is that it would open up Trump and his associates to discovery which would just be a goldmine (plus they’ll never prove malice, so they’ll lose).

"Even if he meant it as a joke, a presidential candidate shouldn't make such comments. But this is the problem, isn't it. He's such a low bar, we overlook things that would be unacceptable to anyone else. And that's how trump gets away with thing many with his supporters. "
'Frankly, I don\'t see how this would change anyone\'s mind who is still supporting Trump at this point after everything that has happened. They\'ll just side with his reasoning about "Crooked Hillary." Before I continue, I want to say I do not support Trump. I\'m a liberal. However, this sub and most of reddit is so biased one way, everyone sees any bit of evidence that could be interpreted as damning as hard evidence. Everyone\'s hopeful and yet nothing has really stuck to Trump. This video is more of the same of him saying his dumb shit about Hillary and honestly doesn\'t prove anything. If he was recorded or otherwise somehow proven to meet with a Russian contact and directly asked for this information, that would be different. This is just more of him spouting his usual BS and it\'s hard to separate what\'s real and what\'s not. This won\'t change the mind of anyone who is still pro-Trump.'

His PSA test score is 0.15 (very low). His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary.\n> \n> Mr Trump has suffered no form of cancer, has never had a hip, knee or shoulder replacement or any other orthopaedic surgery. His only surgery was an appendectomy at age ten. His cardiovascular status is excellent. He has no history of ever using alcohol or tobacco products.\n> \n> If elected, Mr Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\n> \n> Harold N Bornstein, MD, FACG\n> \n> Department of Medicine, Section of Gastroenterology\n> \n> Lenox Hill Hospital, New York, NY\n\nEdit: For the sake of comparison, [here's his 2018 physical report from Ronny Jackson](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Summary-of-Physical-Exam-for-President-Trump-12-Jan-2018.pdf)."

'recordings and documents are all excellent forms of evidence, but having an eyewitness to corroborate the documentary evidence are considered as close to what you may consider a "slam dunk" in evidentiary terms, they are extremely hard to knock down.\n\nBut Cohen brings in another facet; he can give leads or hearsay evidence that may not be ready for court, but may allow Muellers team to track down further witnesses and evidence. \n\nI guess it was Avernatti who said that Cohen was an evidence hoarder and lets hope that\'s true, but he has also destroyed evidence as indicated in the seized content of his shredding machine. If indeed, evidence pertaining to Donald Trump was shredded, then they only remaining probative link to that evidence is Cohen\'s own admissions of that evidence, which may (or may not) be as good as having the documents, but is a hell of a lot better than NOT having his testimony. Most lawyers do not think evidence is truly lost, if witnesses to that evidence are available. Cohen availability to corroborate as an eyewitness of evidence destroyed is indeed a goldmine. '

"where's mccabe, strzok, and lisa page? Clinton, Obama, Soros, Satan, Hitler?\nthat painting is missing quite a few people. "
'Trump fired one of his employees and Mueller had to do the same. So far they are even. '
'Except maybe the 4 or 5 Meuller had to let go because of conflict of interest?'
'Good. Weed out the bad ones. Let the investigation be fair'
'Nope. Quit watching Fox News. They blatantly make things up to deceive you. Cite how his team is corrupt.'

'Ann Coulter is a pot of goblin shit brought to life by a 13th-century Icelandic warlock.'
'I’m going to hazard a guess that since the Alabama election took place, nobody who’s anybody is going to be taking Bannon seriously. He pretty much pissed away what credibility he had.'
'I’m referring to employees who were in violations. I’m sure Mueller has decided not work with many people so far but he did need to remove an Agent when it became obvious he was seriously compromised. Similar with Trump had to do with Flynn. '
'He’s alliterating to the fact that they are all rabid trump haters'
'Don\'t forget about his hours of "executive time" every morning, his lunch break, his pre- and post-supper break...'
"What was their take on it? It doesn't matter because he needs vacation? And what about Trump complaining about Obama's vacations? Any take on that?"

'Sarcasm was apparently lost on the crowd 🙄'
'The /s is necessary in the age of enhanced weaponized stupidity and viral propaganda.'
"You've lost the plot entirely. All modern presidents require security. The current president is not special in this regard.\n\nThe argument, again, is that taxpayers, including the both of us, are paying *unnecessarily* high levels for security due to Trump's insistence on traveling to Florida so frequently."
"It appears that was before he actually became president. The list I made above doesn't include incidents prior to inauguration. Even so, it doesn't matter whether Trump is part of the list or not. The point is, all US presidents run a very real risk of being assassinated, Democrat or Republican. They're all going to need that security (yes, that naturally includes Trump).\n\nDemocrat presidents need protection, to use your words, **AGAINST PEOPLE LIKE YOU**.\n\nI mean, of course I don't actually believe so. Just because you hold a different political opinion doesn't mean you're a homicidal maniac.\n\nPlease realise that not all Democrats are trying to kill Trump."
'You could kill off an army by making them play a trump-based drinking game where you have to drink every time he lies.'
'Can we point to a time Trump himself specifically denied staying overnight in Moscow?'
'Or what he accuses other people of. '
"Did he just watch them pee on each other or did they pee on him? Were there rubber sheets? I'm not sure how this works, technically. I'm from a rural community."
"Does this mean the Trump lied to the FBI when he told Comey he didn't sleep over?"
"I'm telling you right now\n\nHIS BASE WON'T CARE.\n\nGets charged.\n\nHIS BASE WON'T CARE.\n\nGets impeached. \n\nHIS BASE WON'T CARE. "
'AFAIK, Trump explicitly told Comey that he did not stay a night in Moscow. Whether this could be considered obstruction of justice or perjury is up for debate, since he wasn’t being formally questioned at the time. But in the light of the rest of the Russia probe, it seems suspicious that he would try to minimize his time there. If nothing untoward happened in the two days he spent in Moscow, why would he try to say he spent less time there?'
'He claims the pee tape cannot be true, because he didn’t stay in Moscow overnight. '
'Proves collusion with the Russians to destroy our election. '
"Where is Muad'Dib when you need him? I think a spell in the pain amplifier would do Trump (and the country) wonders."
'His base doesn’t get to ignore this. '
"I've been saying this for months. I really think the issue with the Tape isn't the Peeing act itself, nor the fact that Trump hires hookers, but a missing detail being that the prostitutes are vastly underage. "
"I dunno about black, I'd put money on not white for sure though"
'Dope. Crazy that he can\'t even confirm details of his own life and has to cite "people with him on the trip."'
'Possibly, but he doesn’t seem cunning enough. I’m not sure he even knows what cunning means.'
'I guess it gives him an out. he specifically said that people told him that, so now he can say  "so and so lied, I guess I was there."'
"They want to disqualify low level engineers building defense hardware for smoking pot half a decade ago, but don't even bother to vet high level officials with major business conflicts of interest.\n\nOK"
"This is so frustrating to me. If I did half the stuff Trump and his administration have I'd be out of the job, or in jail. It feels like because they have money the law doesn't apply to them to the same extent. "
'  Note: not full article.\n\n\n>It is a scandal that more than one year after President Trump assumed office, dozens of officials serving in highly sensitive posts have not yet received full security clearances.\n\n>It appears many of them might never receive full security clearances, and only now are the American people and Congress discovering how and why this unprecedented situation occurred and continues today.\n\n>Normally, the time frame for obtaining security clearances for officials serving in highly sensitive posts takes two, three or four months at most.\nHistorically, the time frame for many of these clearances begins during the transition period when the identity of many important individuals serving in these posts is known by the president-elect and his transition managers.\n\n>The situation surrounding former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, who has been accused of spousal abuse by two former wives and never received a full security clearance after many months of vetting, has brought the larger security clearance scandal to national attention. \n\n>The question of what the president and his White House chief of staff knew about this matter, and when they knew it, is part of a larger problem that creates serious and continuing national security dangers for the nation.\n\n>The White House staff secretary is one of the most important jobs in an administration, involving daily access to the most sensitive secrets of state, and must be held by someone who can be fully trusted with the most classified information and fully protected from being potentially blackmailed by our nation’s enemies and others who wish us ill. '
'incompetence at its finest! '
"Because that debt can be used as leverage against you. \n\nIt's a very reasonable thing to reject security clearance for."
'Only the president does not need a security clearance, because he\'s the president. All of the other do need them. It\'s highly unusual for someone to work with a temporary clearance for more than a couple of months. For "dozens" to be working with temporary clearances for over a year is...well, it\'s nuts.'
'Yes, the FBI, led by a Republican, started an investigation based on things that a Republican adviser said, got some research commissioned by a Republican news outlet, and used this as a part of a FISA warrant application on Trump\'s "coffee boy". This warrant was then approved by a FISC judge appointed by a Republican (John Roberts), and was then renewed more than once by officials appointed by Trump (Rosenstein, Boente).\n\nThat\'s why it\'s a conspiracy by the Democrats!\n\n'
"> I'm amazing more military and DoD personnel haven't spoken up about it.\n\nWe mutter amongst ourselves, not only about the stupid and arbitrary requirements for a clearance but also the insane amount of time it takes."
'It really depends on the agency, what your job would be (e.g. CIA field agents they want people willing to do sketchy shit, CIA desk jockeys they want boyscouts), and whether or not the pot use happened in college.'
'republicans are deep state cunts just like your scambag democrats'
"I'm not defending the guy and certainly not the accusations, but what I haven't been able to figure out is why domestic abuse would negate one's ability to get clearance. Do you have any input there? "
'You\'re allowed to hold and express political opinions. Just not while representing yourself as a member of the military or commenting on military matters. "I think that..." is okay, "As an Army Captain, I think that..." is not.\n\nI stick to discussing fact when trending into such topics. Sometimes those facts don\'t reflect well on a particular statement, but they\'re usually just numbers or historical observations or reviews of how the law actually works.\n\nIt\'s a fine balancing act for me. I work in media (tech journalism) and occasionally have to touch on politics in my work, so I have to stick to the dispassionate facts. I\'m no top-tier YouTuber or anything, but I am still a public persona and make a point to be myself, publicly, at all times. I just sometimes have to keep a few opinions to my close personal circle and not public air any grievances I may have.'
'You can even lose everything and still be a "billionaire".'
'Not to mention vulnerability to blackmail; if you have something like that on your record, it gives people leverage over you, since publicizing it could kill your career. '
'This is the one.  Everyone else has completely missed the point.'
'Is there any precedent for clearance being revoked after an extramarital affair surfaces? There HAS to be a politician that had clearance and found themselves in the middle of a scandal. '
'Domestic violence is not a felony in the vast majority of states. '
'Obama. Wait - Mexicans! No, Hillary!'
'Sadly accurate. '
'Crazy like a Fox. What do you think we would be talking about, if it wasn’t for crying children? It’s disgusting.'
"And who's fault is that? The democrats, of course."
'FAKE NEWS!'
'THE FBI IS CORRUPT! WITCH HUNT!!!!!!'
'Wait, people are being tortured and killed?'
'Yeah, Trump causes his own problems. His own Twitter feed is incriminating.'
'This is such a stupid and incorrect assessment of politicians.'
"How dare people not want children in cages! It's what makes 'Merica wrong again and that's all right with the right."
'I was talking about how they might do that, now that it\'s clear theyre willing to blame it all on the parents.\nOTOH, people ARE dying in ICE\'s care. Tortured, well that depends. A lot of pediatritions and child healthcare workers say doing this to children and simultaneously denying them physical comfort is traumatic and some have gone as far as calling it "torture" to those children. We\'re not there yet but Hitler also didn\'t send the Jews to the chambers day one, so...'
'T-Don is filled with sarcasm then.'
'He’s dumb'
'Well, regardless of whether I disagree or agree with your statement, you\'re getting downvoted because we have this false equivalency both sides thing going on here in America... where one side is significantly worse than the other especially in terms of spreading misinformation, but claim the other side is just as bad.\n\n\n\nI remember some months ago, Fox was putting out blatant propaganda about something (they change topics too often to remember what it was at the time) but then made a huge fuss because out of the gigantic group of payments made to Michael Cohen from all sorts of shady enterprises, 1 account in the report was from a different Michael Cohen, but 99% had been verified.\n\n\n\nIts like equating a type-o to a blatantly false story because "both sides" made a mistake. It\'s actually societal cancer.'
'The dumbest'
'Uhhhh... I’m confused. I agree??'
'Even stupid people are like “He’s real dumb” '
"No its not.\n\nThere's this thing called science and reproducibility.\n\nThere is no Narrative about fucking science.\n\n"
"You're telling me.\n\nApparently intelligence equates to 'elitism,' and I guess being an elite is supposed to be a bad thing... unless you're Trump... idk it's all very confusing."
"Colleges are notoriously 'liberal' - and I've met a lot of very conservative people who are well into their careers in technology based industries. So, one may graduate college a liberal, stay in college a liberal, but once you are in the working world I suspect a lot of people's perspective matures. I know mine did post- college."

'Oliver Stone is a crazy Trumpist/Putin apologist these days.'
"THere's much more to come. They're saying there are so many charges, it's such a complex case, that this one case alone will take at least 6 months, which means Mueller's case has to keep going for that long too. This is the tip of the iceberg."
"https://www.scribd.com/document/363002970/Manafort-gates-Indictment-Filed-and-Redacted#from_embed\n\nHere ya go.\n\nBasically, it all boils down to money he received as a foreign agent in the Ukraine, his *management* of said money, and his failure to report that money and his involvement with a foreign entity before being appointed to the administration.

"Moving the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem cost tax payers millions of dollars, and has led to protests and violence.  Trump's vacation budget has cost tax payers millions of dollars.

'**Demagogue**\n\nA demagogue  (from Greek δημαγωγός, a popular leader, a leader of a mob, from δῆμος, people, populace, the commons + ἀγωγός leading, leader) or rabble-rouser is a leader in a democracy who gains popularity by exploiting prejudice and ignorance among the common people, whipping up the passions of the crowd and shutting down reasoned deliberation. Demagogues overturn established customs of political conduct, or promise or threaten to do so.\n\nDemagogues have appeared in democracies since ancient Athens. They exploit a fundamental weakness in democracy: because ultimate power is held by the people, it is possible for the people to give that power to someone who appeals to the lowest common denominator of a large segment of the population.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

'Don\'t know if this has been shared already, but there\'s this podcast called "Opening Arguments" that has devoted two episodes to the Stormy Daniels stuff (episodes 154 & 155). I\'m just a layman with no legal knowledge, but from what these guys are saying (one of the hosts is an actual lawyer), this whole thing could play out to where Trump would be in legit trouble. Like, worst than Bill Clinton. And it wouldn\'t just be because he committed adultery with a porn star. \n\nHere\'s the podcast right here: https://openargs.com/'
"Could have been worse...... could have been rape allegations like Clinton\n\nrape allegations\n\nNot sex between two consensual adults but RAPE!!\n\nplus the TWO sexual relations WHILST President\n\nhow weird you guys don't bring that up"
"I'm sure anyone donating will be doing so to hurt Trump, not help Daniels."
"Prudent to see what happens at that hearing before dropping $$$, there are more needy people than a porn star who took the money and now wants a do over because she and her lawyers think she can get her grubby hands on more money.\nI'm not saying she's wrong and Trump is right, I'm saying based on the circumstances I personally don't think she deserves financial assistance given the amount of need and poverty that is currently otherwise out there."
'Except we do repeatedly. Don’t forget the 17 women accusing Trump of sexual assault who Congress isn’t let testify. \n\nFuck off bot. We aren’t using women like chess pieces like you do. '
'Oh my God go the fuck away.'
"More to the point, while she can in theory speak out in violation of the NDA to tell her story, if she were to put out a book without first invalidating the NDA, 100% of the book's proceeds would likely go to Trump (or Cohen?) rather than Stormy."
"I could swear I read yesterday that neither Trump nor the Notary had signed the NDA.  If that is the case, it has no legal bearing whatsoever.\n\nBut, I've been working on taxes and may be confusing it with something else."
'NDA might be tossed out because it is being used to cover a crime (adultery is laughably a crime in new york). So theoretically if she has good lawyers she can tell all with an air of legal protection.'
'I totally agree with you. Just because one greedy person is slightly less abhorrent than the other does not mean I have to root for either one of them.'
'Oh you only care when its the guy you hate\n\n3 rape allegations against Clinton\n\nRAPE!!!!\n\nnot consensual sex between two adults but RAPE.....weird that'

"Like I said, in general you'd have to pay a buttload of money as penalty for breaking an NDA, I'm not saying that is Stormy's plan. Stormy is trying to take the legal route and be legally released from her NDA so that she is allowed to speak about the affair. Since she's taking it to court, she can reasonably predict how much this lawsuit will cost her. The money she is asking for is to finance her lawsuit, not to finance any penalties for breaking the NDA. "

'So does it not strike you as strange that a special counsel assigned to find evidence of Russian collusion has found no such evidence in over a year of investigations? He’s gone so far outside the scope of the investigation that it’s plain as day they’ll stop at nothing until SOMETHING is found. If that doesn’t scream political motivation, then I’m afraid I don’t have the time or the crayons to explain it to you. How would you feel if you were indicted... no, merely accused of tax fraud and an investigator found no such evidence, but kept searching for something, ANYTHING to convict you of something? Because that’s the direction our “justice” department is going if you tollorate and encourage this behavior. '
'Worshiping con-men  and charlatan politicians has a long history in the United States. Trump just proves that the "information age" didn\'t change that situation. We have a solid 25% of the population who will believe any bullshit out there and then fight for their ignorance.'

"They shouldn't have to. You know that nonsense you said was just that.\n\nYou wouldn't understand a response anyway "
'A few questions. \n\n1. How do you know he\'s found nothing? You don\'t know what he has or hasn\'t found, just that he hasn\'t released his findings or directly charged anyone for crimes directly relating to collusion in the election. \n\n2. How has he strayed "so far outside of the scope that it\'s plain they\'ll stop at nothing"? EVERY person who has been charged has been charged for crimes related to.... wait for it... inappropriate dealings with Russia (or lying to the FBI about those dealings). EVERY SINGLE ONE. \n\nIt\'s simply mindblowing to think that an investigation into russian collusion that finds other crimes involving Russia is somehow considered off topic. And it\'s absurdly naive to think that Mueller would lay his cards on the table by charging any of the parties with something directly tied to the election when he still has plenty of cards to play, witnesses to interview, and leads to follow. \n\nHe\'s not going to tip Trump off by charging Manafort with something tied directly to the election before he even talks to Trump. That\'s what smart people call counterproductive. \n\n\nEdit: \n\nIf nothing else, the raiding of Trump\'s attorney\'s office shows that Mueller is quite concerned about the limits of his scope. After all, he referred it back to the FBI, rather than taking it on himself. \n'

'If he pardons ANYONE associated with this investigation, thats a red-line too, just like firing Mueller or Rosenstein. No doubts about it. '
'That’s why he’s trying so hard to make it out as a witch hunt. He knows there’s gonna be lots of indictments, hell there already has been, but if he can make it seem like a biased liberal witch hunt, even though there would need to be overwhelming evidence for him to be charged and convicted, he can throw pardons around and claim he’s fighting injustice and his fans will 100% believe him. I can’t believe that a president can pardon some, Ive thought this from the day I learned about pardons. They seem like the most anti-American thing ever. Just completely ruins the claim that no one is above the law and completely bypasses the justice system. It’s something you would expect from a dictatorship. Makes zero sense. This isn’t because of Trump either, the concept just completely goes against all America’s values and its foundation. '
"I mean really, it should be in the 90% range, that's the problem. A President pardoning themselves should be an impeachable offense every day of the week."

'Impeachment cannot be a criminal charge (being impeached doesn’t directly result in going to prison, just removal from office, per the constitution). The president can be impeached and later tried for criminal proceedings. Which is why Ford pardoned Nixon. \n\nCriminal prosecution is purely an executive function. As the President is the chief executive, it is in his right to stop any criminal proceedings against him. Congress can impeach and is their only recourse. You cannot pardon an impeachment. \n\nThe courts know this any any legal challenge would result in a “political question”: they will not step in as congress has the power to do so. If they don’t have the will to do so, that’s congress’s problem. '

Isn't that a problem when these people don't think the rules apply to them? Because that goes for rules like taxes (wait until we finally see Trump's), inhuman acts (purposely separating children is against the humanitarian conventions), and oh...elections (it's important that people get to choose their leaders, otherwise leaders will choose themselves which leads to insurrection when the people find out."

"Then you must think every political ad manipulates peoples opinions? Aren't both sides doing that and pretty much how the R and the D's try to sway voters?\n\nA lot of people were turned away from voting democrat because of how bernie was pushed out of the race, how is bernie not winning the primary and people's turnout related to Russia\n\nOr are you saying that the DNC emails were fake and not to be believed by the general public and they should have voted for hillary? isn't that taking peoples right to choose."
"Son, Russia didn't hack the election, that's what your hysteria is about. Obviously I'm referring to what you guys think Russia did, which you cant even pinpoint, unless you mean a bunch of facebook ads?\n\nDNC didn't lose from Russian meddling , they lost from rigging the primary to favor Clinton (detailed in internal emails) and losing ground in blacks and Hispanics (trump got more than previous candidate )"

'Trump holding subpoena in one hand and a book titled Ides of March in the other saying something dumb like "This, looks bad. Caesar didn\'t get impeached did he?"'
"It's so obvious that Trump's real role is to destabilize global unity. Without strong UN, NATO, and trade relationships essentially, without US holding the world together, Russia can get away with their goals. "
'NATO benefits Europe more than the US? No shit Sherlock, which landmass do you think Russia is on?'
'Agreed.  Russia may not be powerful compared to maybe NATO countries, but it can still bully the shit out of smaller countries and annex them without a united front from NATO or the world.  '

"When I first heard Giuliani say Trump reimbursed the Stormy payment, I was sure it was a calculated and if not smart, at least a decent way to do some damage control. The more I hear though, the more likely it seems there is absolutely no coordinated plan among them, and that Giuliani has simply turned into a grumpy old man with zero filter. At this point I'm sure if he met Mueller he'd confess to everything Trump has done before Mueller even opens his mouth."

"Look this can be unpacked into a very simple way of looking at it.\n\nI think the people who are on the fence are worried that Trump is a puppet of Putin.\n\nHow would Mueller prove that. Money or verifying the dossier. He would be able to show financial transactions or deals etc between Trump and Russia.\n\nFrom those questions it's clear there's no such evidence.\n\nEverything else is a farce."
"If I'm demonstrably wrong, then demonstrate it!\n\nI'll start. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXcETZzR5bc\nComey admits under oath in a hearing that he leaked his memos to the New York Times in an attempt to trigger the assignment of a special council. This is factual, and you can watch it come out of his own mouth!\n\nAlso, the memos were written during his time as FBI director and are therefore property of the US Government.

I'll wait."
"No, it's a problem even if he isn't a putin puppet. If he worked with the Russians to break US laws in order to get elected that's a problem.\n\nAs to your point, yeah his financial information would do a lot to clear things up. He knows this. He said he would release his taxes if he ran, then he went back on that pledge. He has also gone back on his subsequent offers to release his taxes. \n\nYou are assuming that the guy who broke with 50 years of tradition to hide his taxes doesn't have anything to hide in them."
"You are just making stuff up now.\n\nHow many lawyers do you think worked for the Kremlin in the world? It's like asking how many work for our government.\n\nThe facts are she had nothing on Hillary and no information from the Kremlin but if it was proved she did work for the Kremlin and was there on their behalf then that would raise more questions. \n\nWhy setup Trump Jr and then give him no evidence? Are these the same people in Russia who give Steele the dossier. This would point back to Hillary collusion. \n\nNeither are crimes. Even the MSM admit this plus you can't indict a president so it the actual legality doesn't even matter."
"I'm not making anything up, you just spend all your time in an echo chamber where all the bad news is filtered out.\n"
"You brought up the FEC. Say his campaign was guilty. \n\nHe wasn't because he used his own money but he even if he was it would be a fine. Obama's campaign was fined for a much larger amount.\n\nIt has nothing to do with Echo Chambers. I think you are projecting.\n\nThere's no collusion. No obstruction. No ability to serve a subpoena so Trump won't talk. Nothing.\n\nThe only crimes that have been committed have been by people in the intelligence service in an attempt to start this witch Hunt. Their insurance policy."
"There's no evidence he did that. Mueller doesn't even intend to ask him any questions relating to that.\n\nTrump could have intended to go easy on Russia simply because he thought it was the right thing to do and Putin helped because that was his policy. There doesn't have to have been a quid pro quo.\n\nThat's even if that is what happened.\n\nBut there's no evidence Putin did even intend to help Trump specifically. The evidence Mueller has presented showed he was helping everyone else to hurt Clinton not to help anyone in particular. Is Bernie also guilty of collusion?\n\nNo you don't have a moral right to know. Privacy is important. Governments don't have a right to your personal documents just because they don't like you or the people who voted for you.\n\nThat's getting into banana republic territory.\n\nHe didn't fire Comey because he was investigating Trump. He fired him because he didn't publically state that he wasn't investigating Trump and didn't want the cloud over his administration and the President has every right under the Constitution to do so. The FBI and DOJ are under the executive branch and he's the head of that branch."
"That's why the fat idiot traitor is talking to his master today.  He feels the heat.  "
"He's moving on Trump like a bitch. When you're Mueller, they'll let you do whatever you want."
'Man, I think you might be in for a rude surprise. '
'You guys are actually sorta sad :('
'My gut feel is that Mueller will simply indict Trump. He will slowly get closer and closer to Trump and then he will issue a series of indictments against the most powerful in one fell swoop.\n\nThat way Trump is subject to criminal charges, and anything Trump does will be blatant obstruction of justice.'
"Mueller is not head of the FBI he did not replace Comey. \n\nHe is head of the investigation into Trump's Russia ties. He's not going to be investigating anything else, unfortunately for your narrative."

"33% will always be with Trump in the polls.  It doesn't matter if 100% were with him, though, because the law is still the law, and Trump has been running illegal operations for the Russians for at least a decade now.\n\nAbout 50% of Americans say Trump has definitely done something illegal.  It takes a lot nefariousness to give that impression to half the country."
"**Dismissal of James Comey**\n\nJames Comey, the 7th director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), was dismissed by U.S. President Donald Trump on May 9, 2017. Comey had been under public and political pressure as a result of both the FBI's role in the Hillary Clinton email controversy and the FBI's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections, which also involves a possible collusion with the 2016 Donald Trump campaign.\n\nTrump dismissed Comey by way of a termination letter citing recommendations from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. He then gave various explanations for the dismissal, in which he contradicted the impression that Sessions and Rosenstein had influenced his decision.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28"

'This is based on an article written by Mark Levin a conservative pundit with a legal background. He is usually wrong on legal matters more than he is right (no pun intended)\n\nhere is what I wrote earlier on another thread that touched up Mark Levins article:\n\n>Apples and Oranges. The article is specious on its face as Levin is confusing positions\n\n>The Constitutional Clause Levin is referring to is administrative positions and cabinet level positions. Mueller was hired as an attorney, a prosecutor, and does not have the level of authority that would trip an administrative position clause.\n\n>That\'s why Mueller\'s position is overseen by Rosenstein and the Attorney Generals office, who do fit the description of the Executive Appointment Levin is referring to.\n\n>Most legal experts would say that Mueller\'s position cannot be directly fired by the President, as he was not appointed by him, and only the AG\'s office can do that. The President has the authority to fire anybody at an Executive position at his will, as they serve at his pleasure, but its was quite clear that Mueller\'s position would require a "for cause" finding, which means he would have to do something that violated the terms of employment of his position.\n\n>Levin wants to put Mueller in an executive position, but have none of the independent freedom(Mueller reports to Rosenstein) it is entitled to.\n\n>This is typical of Levin who uses his knowledge of the law to obscure and twist facts for people not versed or unfamiliar with it.\n\n>When confronted, he usually combats it with "its my opinion" which is probably why he does not actively practice law.\n\n'

'Of course he has to hide. Otherwise Trump telling the truth  would expose him for being the liar that he is'
"If you asked to see my tax return, I wouldnt show you. No reason to show anybody either unless there is a criminal investigation regarding payments or tax evasion. His 2005 return Is public. He paid over 30 million in taxes and there are no fishy incomes reported. Of course that doesn't mean any year after that couldn't hold something fishy, but there really isn't a reason to believe that there is anything fishy to begin with since there isn't any indication of wrong doing, other than hoping he did something wrong."
'Have evidence he has no money? Any source?'
"The media lost their collective minds because he had dinner with his family without telling him. You think there is any possible way they wouldn't make his tax returns look bad?"
'Oh good, I was worried that we might have a conversation without Hillary. Glad someone brought her up! /s'
"Bullshit. Bull. Fucking. Shit. Every single presidential candidate for past 40 years has released their tax returns. Except Trump.\n\nPlus, Trump himself *repeatedly* said that he would release them, and he still hasn't. Your bullshit excuse for his unprecedented secrecy is exactly that. Bullshit."
"The same thing I expect to see in every other candidate's returns: transparency.\n\nWhat does Trump have to hide that would cause him to violate 40 years of unanimous precedent?"
'Fox News watchers are dumb, not stupid.'
"Keep in mind that the president cannot fire the vice president. Even the president's usual, passive-agressive act like he uses on Jeff Sessions won't encourage Mike Pence to resign and I think even the clueless president knows it."

"ELI5: Didn't Devin Nunes recuse himself from the investigation? So how was he legally allowed to release that bullshit memo written by republicans?"
"He didn't formally recuse himself, he just said a whole bunch of bullshit that made it sound like he might recuse himself."
"> Nunes should just shut his mouth\n\nAssuming that we're all agreed that Nunes is an enemy of the people, then never interrupt your enemy while he is making a mistake.\n\nWe have a segment of the population that will believe whatever their propagandist talking heads tell them to believe, but even they have a limit, and they're starting to crack.\n\nNunes should write a book and go on Oprah."
"Are they starting to crack? I've been sure they will eventually but my faith in both logic and humanity itself have been strained by the ordeal of the Dump Regime."
"This isn't necessarily true. DoJ guidelines say that a sitting president can't be indicted, and it seems likely that Mueller would follow them, but some lawyers have argued that this conclusion is inaccurate, that a president who was an active participant in a criminal conspiracy could 100% be indicted just like anyone else. If Mueller decides he agrees with them he'll probably hold onto that as a last resort, but he'd definitely rather have Rosenstein present his findings to congress."

'What the fuck does Robert Mueller have to do with the IRS?'
'I believe they never intended for it to actually be released.  They were counting on Trump to act "presidential" and deny release due to national security concerns, so that they could then play it up to the base.  And once again, as usual, Trump shat all over them and left Nunes and Gowdy out on that thin limb.  \n\nAnd Gowdy just said "fuck it, I\'ve had enough of this crazy train."'

I'm talking tens, if not hundreds of thousands of documents. It's entirely possible that they already have most, if not all of what they're subpoenaing and they just want to see what gets omitted so they can file a felony False Statements charge to flip another witness.\n\nSubpoenas are extremely aggressive, like approaching Manafort's no-knock search warrant aggressive, so given the political attention this probe is getting they probably don't send them out until they're confident that something is being concealed from them."
"Well, who's NOT on the list? Kushner\n\nEither he is the witness himself, or his communications with this individual are unimportant, and given the other people mentioned in this subpeona I find it hard to believe the latter."
"I think it has to be another explanation. \n\nRick Gates has already pleaded. Manafort has already been indicted, yet Mueller keeps dropping charges on him, and wants his documents.\n\nFor all we've seen, he would turn the White House upside down if only to add a day's count to someone."

'[Maybe not the best example](https://english.tau.ac.il/news/exodus_history_and_myth)\n\n>"The question of historical accuracy in the story of Exodus has occupied scholars since the beginning of modern research," says Prof. Finkelstein. "Most have searched for the historical and archaeological evidence in the Late Bronze Age, the 13th century BCE, partly because  the story mentions the city of Ramses, and because at the end of that century an Egyptian document referred to a group called ’Israel‘ in Canaan. However, there is no archaeological evidence of the story itself, in either Egypt or Sinai, and what has been perceived as historical evidence from Egyptian sources can be interpreted differently. Moreover, the Biblical story does not demonstrate awareness of the political situation in Canaan during the Late Bronze Age – a powerful Egyptian administration that could have handled an invasion of groups from the desert.

Any Republican that voted with the Dems to remove Trump would have a target on their back for the rest of their days, thanks to Trump's base of gun-stroking true-believer lunatics."
'Pence may well be wrapped up in this, but even if he isn’t, I don’t have much fear of a pence presidency. I don’t see him being able to do anything that trump isn’t already doing anyway, and especially if the house and/or senate is in dem hands. And I think a pence re-election is less likely than a trump re-election. '

'He cried when they gave him his sentence apparently. '
'The issue i see is that the people that are supposed to defend the judiciary in our current time have no backbone and will just cave without a whimper. '
'It is the duty of the judiciary to say what the law is. As long as we have the rule of law, interpreted by non-partisan judges, the republican will stand. \n\nStacking district courts with Trump judges is not as effective as they would have you believe. They are checked by their colleagues and the gravity of their role. '
">The meeting took place at Trump Tower and the then-president-elect was  shown evidence that included texts and emails from Russian military  officers, according to the Times. There was also information gathered  from a top-secret source close to Putin, which outlined the Kremlin’s  plan to sway the 2016 election, the report said.\n\nIf Muller didn't know where the smoking gun was before, he does now."

He  knows how much incriminating shit they now have from the Cohen raid. This is 100&#37; self\\-preservation and he\'s scrambling for the approach that will give him the best odds of surviving.\n\nIronically, it\'s probably what\'s going to spell his demise.'
'Not necessarily. Once Rosenstein is fired, the Senate still has to vote on his replacement. That could take a few weeks, and even then, nobody is to say whether or not the senate republicans would go along with that as many have started to turn away from the president.'

"Question for you, im not American and your government can get hella confusing so forgive me if it's easy answer.\n\nWhen/If Rosenstein is fired and the new appointee(s) need to confirmed by congress, who does Mueller report to as a supervisor to greenlight everything?\n\nOr is it managed autonomously until someone is confirmed?\n\nSorry if it's a dumb question "

"I'm not sure, I would assume the governor would have that authority but I'm no expert.  "
'How? There are no known state crimes coming '
"Trump has one thing left: the ear of ~30% of the population of the USA. If Putin wants to sow maximum chaos in the short term, he lets Trump escape for at least a little while. A deposed president, House and Senate in chaos, and worldwide attention to a country where everybody is looking for blood one way (justice for the crooked crony) or another (revenge against the Deep State). \n\nIn the long run, I don't know what the better decision would be. He might not be looking forward to long-term retaliation in the form of trade restrictions and an economical repeat of the Cold War (or, if things really get out of hand, military aggression), but he's probably not done with his plans for the USA (and the rest of the world) either.

'Nunberg is also a close associate of Roger Stone, and he advised Donald Trump since early 2014. Nunberg was terminated on August 2, 2015. But before he was fired, in July 2016, Trump accused Nunberg of violating a confidentiality agreement and sought $10 million from Nunberg. According to The Hill, Trump accused Nunberg of leaking a story about a dispute between former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and spokeswoman Hope Hicks. Nunberg claimed that the arbitration was part of the campaign\'s attempts to "silence" him after he endorsed Ted Cruz. On August 11, 2016, Nunberg and Trump settled on an agreement that could not be relitigated, according to Politico. But for it to be Nunberg, the questions I have are, why the November 1st, 2015 date for the emails? And what happened after that date that was of significance to the investigation?'

'involving carter page in anything is destine to fail. '
"However, now that he's gone public about his refusal, I wonder if Mueller will attempt to get a pre-emptive no-knock warrant to avoid spoliation of evidence. If he doesn't, it also might point to the fact that Mueller already has those emails."

'There are two circumstances where it\'s okay to say no. \n\n1. the burden of the court order is overbearing (like it would take multiple weeks to fulfil, an unreasonable amount of work)\n\n2. you yourself are implicated by the response, in which case you must *explicitly* say "I plead the 5th" (those are legal magic words, if you don\'t say them, nothing happens, your silence can be used against you otherwise) \n#    \n*and then you have to actually shut up* (if you start talking again without being prompted, the Court interprets that as a 5th amendment waiver until you plead explicitly again)'

What’s weak to me in this article is that Wiki appears to have kept reaching to Don Jr. Don Jr. responded several times, but largely ignored the emails. It does not appear that he actually did much with a few exceptions - like the meeting at Trump Tower (but that was largely Pappadapolous)? Communications alone are not enough to support conspiracy - there has to be intent to commit a crime.  Receiving information alone may or may not constitute conspiracy - a large part would depend on whether you actually received the information and what you do with it afterwards. I agree there’s stuff here- just not sure how bad it is. But when you add up all the little bads, it can add up to one big bad. Good part is - I do trust our Mueller. '

"Mueller issuing indictments is, again, not proof, not evidence of anything. If it were, you could point to it and say, there, it's obvious who is behind all of this.

Sandwich, Ham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ham_sandwich#Cultural_impact). Let's see that evidence delivered in a courtroom. Oops, we can't and never will because conveniently, these are all foreign nationals who will never set foot in a US courtroom.

So, exactly how much is Mueller's grand jury indictment worth in terms of laying out the truth? Approximately nothing.\n\nThe FBI never laid hands on the DNC server. The gold standard in those cases is swoop in, lock down everything, mirror everything immediately and start digging for clues. They did none of that. Instead Comey offered the very tepid, well, my folks tell me this was ok to not actually do the investigating ourselves but just rely on the firm hired by the DNC to tell us what they found. Nope. That's half-assed, and if it weren't the DNC, he'd never settle for that."

Obviously we don’t have access to it yet, that’s why you clearly argue in bad faith, you know how it works, yet pretend not to in the hopes of fooling those less versed.

'Pretty sure there are a number of criminal investigations ongoing that will come before any civil ones. The first and easiest to prove in court would be Obstruction of Justice, first by firing Comey (it\'s the *why* he fired Comey that\'s important), and if he\'s stupid enough to try to fire Mueller he\'ll be going down the same path Nixon started with his "Saturday Night Massacre". He\'s also publicly admitted on Twitter and other public comments about why he fired Comey (to stop an investigation, which is absolutely considered obstruction). Some have claimed trump didn\'t write those himself, but there\'s no way someone with an ego like his would let someone else use *his* twitter, since that\'s a primary source of ego stroking for him.  \n\nWitness tampering would be the next easiest to prove, as Bannon\'s council was literally talking to someone in the whitehouse during his initial voluntary testimony about what questions he should answer and how he should answer them. It\'s doubtful they were dumb enough to do it again in front of Mueller in his more recent visits, though. \n\nA better breakdown of these things is found on [Seth Abramson\'s twitter](https://twitter.com/SethAbramson/).  He\'s an attorney, who teaches journalism and legal advocacy subjects at the University of New Hampshire.

'True, but do you think this will actually touch a court room? I mean while he is still in office? I personally feel based off of his psyche he won’t allow himself to be in a situation he knows he’s going to lose, and this is a loser sundae.

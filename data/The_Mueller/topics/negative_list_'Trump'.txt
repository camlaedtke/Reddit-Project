'Everybody around him is dealing with the Russians but he has absolutely no clue?'
"NO COLLUSION!  Just secret meetings that everyone lies about and were totally all about adoptions if they did occur. And that Joke about Russia If You're Listening afterwards was just a Joke. No collusion."

'It\'s fairly easy to pinpoint the exact moment when Trump decided to run for President: you can see it on his face at 1:19 in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eJpWOY3r18) of the 2011 White House Correspondents\' dinner.  You can practically hear the thought as it enters his mind and coalesces: "this man dared to mock me for slandering him, and I\'m going to destroy his legacy at all costs...though, preferably while golfing and raking in cash from the American taxpayers." '
"Trump has been talking about running for president since like 1988. He actually ran in 2000 and got some votes. He talked about running for 2012 and even made an announcement in 2011 that he wasn't going to run. Why is he lying now .. ? This is really weird. "

'Man, people really hate the Cheeto! \n\nThe "scholarly" type here say theres no chance of him going to jail, just impeached. But i\'m gonna go out on a limb and say theres a chance'
"Trump's a fucking liar and he will reap what he's sown. Remember when Trump was #1 Birther?

Kennedy has been on the Court for almost 30 years and has been a rumored retirement since W. If Trump had Kennedy by the balls, why would he force him to retire instead of, idk, using that leverage to get Kennedy to keep making decisions that benefit the Dotard? These conspiracies make zero sense and are embarrassingly-lacking in evidence. \n\nThink critically ffs.

'I\'ve started coming up with my own conspiracy theories and really want to share. Can you guys critique this one for me before I take it to CNN? \n\nDuring the meeting with the FBI, Devin Nunes and Co were allowed to listen to the bombshell evidence of Trump Jr committing treason on tape. They could not figure out a single way to spin this in a positive light, and rightly assumed that informing the president of his son\'s likely incoming indictment would help in absolute no way. So they said nothing. Trump, watching Fox News 24/7, noticed this and ordered Rudy to state on air that they will only agree to an interview if Trump was allowed to review the information seen in that meeting. Mueller, because he\'s not a sucker, probably either refused to respond or told him something far less important.\n\nTrump, now feeling like people are "getting over on him", starts seething in rage and unleashing a legendary stream of crazy tweets. Melania clearly noticed something was wrong, and brought him his favorite meal: Well-done Filet Mignon with Ketchup with a side of doritos. Trump cut into the steak and saw that, once again, his pathetically worthless wife served him meat that was slightly pink. Tired of her shit, he threw her on the floor and whaled on her kidneys. She was then sent to the Emergency Room, where she quietly filled out divorce papers-- knowing full well that the pre-nup and NDA Michael Cohen had her sign prevented the truth from coming out, and allowing Trump\'s team to make up whatever bullshit story they wanted about what happened. When they did, she silently dropped a hint on her twitter page that she was fleeing the white house and returning to NYC.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Sure it\'s a bit nutty but it\'s not like I\'m saying he was born in Kenya or something.'
"Sounds like they've got them dead to rights, just need to let due process work its way through. (I hope)"
'Please indict this Ass Clown already.'
"At this point in time Nunes just has to be considered a traitor to democracy.  It's also time for him to get trumps tiny little dick out of his mouth."
'Every modern democratic country has court over congress..\n\nWhat I cannot comprehend is why court does not give warning to any individual or party if they spread lies?\n\nSaying loudly a false claim is good to damage, when claim is falsified majority would say conspiracy or might not even come to know about it.\n\nWhy is public speaker not accountable for things they say? '
"I wish, but i'm also cynical. "
"I know he's probably only a jack-ass, but I hope Mueller  has something on fucking piece of shit Nunes."
'People so easily forget that, back when the investigation started, Devin Nunes recused himself because he had a undisclosed personal investment in seeing the investigation fail'
"Unfortunately, I don't think anyone could be prosecuted for leaking classified stuff to the president. He is the ultimate source for classification and declassification. He probably doesn't know that though."
"> **Congress shall make no law** respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or **abridging the freedom of speech**, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.  \n  \n-United States Constitution, Amendment 1 (emphasis mine)  \n  \nTo ask the courts for a remedy, you would have to prove that the speaker did actual harm to you. In this case, it would be proving that Nunes' lies obstructed the functioning of the US Government and that it did actual harm to you, personally (not general harm). No court would take that argument seriously."

'Or maybe (most likely) this is just more fake news BS, made up by CNN.'
"Mueller can do more for him than Trump can. Trump can't do anything about state charges, and pardoning him for federal crimes will very likely damn him for related State crimes."
'Ultimately it probably doesn‚Äôt matter that much. Mueller most likely already has a ton of evidence against Trump (and everyone else). If Cohen flips, there will just be that much more evidence but Mueller has them both dead-to-rights at this point. Still, on a psychological level, it‚Äôd be amazing if Cohen flipped; President Bonespurs would lose his shit. '

'I guess we learn now if there truly is no such thing as bad publicity.'
'So I read the excerpt in New York magazine, and I‚Äôm worried that it‚Äôs an unsubstantiated narrative. If the sources aren‚Äôt verified, and evidence shown to back up some of the more extraordinary claims, then it‚Äôs just going to be more fuel to aggravate us. I want there to be some real useful evidence here that will have real consequences for Trump and his goons. Otherwise it‚Äôs just more circle jerk.'
'So Trump Jr meeting with a Russian lawyer who had dirt on HRC= collusion.  \nDNC paying a spy to come up with an unverified dossier which the Obama administration used as an excuse to get a warrant to spy on the opposing campaign= meh\nThis is why the left is insane. '
'The threats were asking wolff to pull the book. Instead of pulling the book he moved up the release date. Therefore it was moved up despite threats. Additionally he knows that all the media surrounding it will boost sales so it is also to take advantage of threats.'

'The lady doth protest too much, methinks.'
"Honestly at this point.... I think just like it's really hard for the onion to lampoon the insanity, i suspect it's hard to exaggerate the trump administration "

You‚Äôre right that this is posturing but just FYI there are extremely limited circumstances where a court could grant an emergency injunction (that would most likely get overturned on appeal).

However, this sub and most of reddit is so biased one way, everyone sees any bit of evidence that could be interpreted as damning as hard evidence.

'recordings and documents are all excellent forms of evidence, but having an eyewitness to corroborate the documentary evidence are considered as close to what you may consider a "slam dunk" in evidentiary terms, they are extremely hard to knock down.\n\nBut Cohen brings in another facet; he can give leads or hearsay evidence that may not be ready for court, but may allow Muellers team to track down further witnesses and evidence. \n\nI guess it was Avernatti who said that Cohen was an evidence hoarder and lets hope that\'s true, but he has also destroyed evidence as indicated in the seized content of his shredding machine. If indeed, evidence pertaining to Donald Trump was shredded, then they only remaining probative link to that evidence is Cohen\'s own admissions of that evidence, which may (or may not) be as good as having the documents, but is a hell of a lot better than NOT having his testimony. Most lawyers do not think evidence is truly lost, if witnesses to that evidence are available. Cohen availability to corroborate as an eyewitness of evidence destroyed is indeed a goldmine. '

"Something that shows that Trump isn't a sock-puppet without an independent functional brain in policy. Taking out the war-games was a good idea, but once again it was fucking ruined by Trump lacking a brain and just taking orders from what another RIVAL political leader told him. "
"I don't know whats scarier. Him losing in 2020 or him winning in 2020.  I honestly don't think he'd leave the white house without nearly starting civil war or a constitutional crises. Im certain he mentally can't accept losing. So he'll declare the election fraudulent and fight the results. What happens if a President refuses to step down, and a large armed rabid populace backs him truly believing he is the rightful winner?   \n"
'Millions of Americans are told by Fux news that Trump kicked ass.  '
"I am absolutely certain that is what many Germans were telling those in fear of Hitler's rise during the early '30s"
">People outside this sub read that headline and go, ‚Äúoh, that‚Äôs just some clickbait‚Äù. You guys read it and have a brain aneurysm.\n\nPersonally, I read the article.  Headlines aren't a good place to get information or make decisions about your ideological alignments."
'Stupid tariffs\n\nEnvironmental policy\n\nHealth care\n\nAnd so on and so forth. Not ‚Äúgrandmaster Putin planned the whole NK summit‚Äù'
'This seems to be an all too common sentiment nowadays - horrifying stuff.'
"> I'm just trying to understand the mentality of many of those who oppose what is actually happening with North Korea?\n\nNobody is opposing a potential deal with North Korea. That is a horrible straw man. The fact that NK is closer than they have ever been to *some kind* of deal that might bring *some sort* of peace is good. Literally everything else around the deal is a flaming pile of shit. \n\nJust because people are skeptical of this administrations motivations doesn't mean people actually oppose the deal itself. "
"We really don't want anything to happen to Manafort before he goes to trial. I don't care if he's pampered, as long as he lives to testify."
'Ellis was savage. Manafort is done. '
'This judge is on fire'
'Oh fuck. I forgot about juries!! Trump supporters are so crazy!'
"He won't testify. He will ride 5th all the way to life in prison. "
'They will, cause they‚Äôll believe trump and that this is all just some stuff made up to try and hurt him.  They‚Äôre not really patriots, they‚Äôre just idiots on the winning team who plug their ears at any mention of cheating.\n\nThe levels of ignorance, self delusion, and conspiracies made up to ignore simple truths is astounding.'
"Yeah, from what I've read it seems like that was basically SOP, but became such a deal because 1. Manafort is high profile and 2. NO COLLUSION REEEEEEEE!"
"jury selection?  hell, i'm waiting for the russians to engage in some hardcore jury tampering."
">Prepare for some major dickfuckery from Manafort's lawyers\n\nManafort is preparing for his own dickfuckery in prison. "
"I'd rather him being pamered and make it to trial. Let's face it, if Putin could get to him he would be killed before he even has the chance to testify. "
'Exactly. They were grabo get onto that normal line of questioning as if it proved something. They‚Äôre freaking out.'
'He should be given an enviably fair and impartial trial. I am actually slightly worried (tin foil hat) that this judge is being outrageous so that they can be replaced with someone who will pretend to be impartial but actually heavily and unfairly  favors the accused (/tin foil hat).'
'>The evidence against him though suggests that he is guilty.\n\nSo youre currently presuming guilt ahead of the conclusion of the trial.'
'Ignore the troll.'
'No I misread the title and thought Trump had said it, not the judge. Whoops lol haters gonna hate though. Loving the guy who called me a bottom feeder'
"Non-American with American wife living in allied country here (although we forced the world to speak English there are only 5 main English speaking countries and we are friends - UK USA CAN AUS NZ).....\n\nPlease keep it up and try stop him, we want to stay friends but it's becoming increasingly difficult to justify and respond to such an erratic and unpredictable leadership."
'I read somewhere someone said that if they put rich criminals in regular jails the prison system would be reformed fast. So true.'
"Letting him email and wear his own clothes isn't stopping the Russian mafia from murdering him. "
'> In reality, he just called Manafort a "high-profile defendant" which is absolutely true.\n\nHe\'s calling him a terrorist, spy and traitor, but is well-versed enough in the law that all people can prove is that he called him a "high profile defendant". '
'How do you feel about the accusations against the Clintons? Have you called them guilty?'
'An individual is allowed to form whatever conclusions they would like about pending trials.  The media really only have to maintain some semblance by reminding people that it\'s all "allegedly." It\'s really the courts that have to maintain a presumption of innocence. Any individuals who show that they may have already formed an opinion can be weeded out by voir dire during jury selection. He\'ll get due process of law. \n\n\n\nI, for one, would be too biased for this jury. I think he\'s a criminal who should be locked up.'
'It\'s #4 I worry about...and that "45" embroidered on his shirt cuff.'
'Not sure if this is legit. I don‚Äôt see ‚Äúbelieve me‚Äù or ‚Äúbigly‚Äù. '
'Fuck Trump'
'Only this tacky fuck would embroider ‚Äú45‚Äù on his cuff. I bet he calls his cabinet members at all hours of the night just to hear them call him ‚ÄúPresident‚Äù. '
' That 45 should have a circle and a slash through it. At least dotted lines to show potential for him losing his job. '
'Or SAD'
'At first I was like ‚Äúgreat! He is using notes to make less of an ass of himself and not seem like a narcissist incapable of empathy‚Äù...\n\nThen I looked at the bullet points...'
'He doesnt know thats coming.. no one is telling him'
'Usually it‚Äôs evened out by the forwards from grandma level memes that spam the front page every day from one of the 100 anti trump subreddits. '
'No prob, was just compelled to offer a correction. Tis a strange word though. '
"Nah. One of Charlie's key personality features is his humility. Charlie knows his limits and flaws. He lets his friends knock him out and tie him up in the trunk when they go out  trips together because Charlie knows that his combination of anxiety and lack of experience makes him panic and ruin things for him and the gang. That shows humility, meaningful self awareness, and capacity for empathy:  positive moral traits trump lacks. "
'I was worried about 06.01.16!'
"He'd still be a dumbass since he should have told his kid to not do that"
'In unrelated news: 13 percent of Americans are fucking morons'
'13% is still millions of people\n\nI have no idea how people are still so incredibly stupid to still support Trump'
'"13% of Americans have the power to deny reality in its entirety"'
'Thats still a sadly large amount of people'
'Shocking '
"They are obviously the people who are illiterate or don't have access to any media other than FOX. Sadly, with Betsy Devoss in charge of our schools they will never learn to read. Is it possible that was the plan all along?"
"I wouldn't be surprised if the number drops to as low as 10&#37; soon enough."
'13% is too damn high.'
'13% of Americans are fucking morons'
"I like how his supporters still  like him even though they know he's a complete scumbag criminal.  Crazy stuff. "
'I miss Bernie Sanders :( '
'Half of Americans voted for him. They should have that tattooed on their foreheads so people will know who it was who destroyed the credibility of American politics.'
'This just in: 13% of Americans clinically retarded. '
'and at least 13% is fucking stupid'
'Also wtf is going on in the heads of that 13%?'
'Yeah this is kinda bad news '
'Angry white Christians from small towns. '
'The world is full of gullible idiots.'
"Well, with your bad knee Ed, you shouldn't throw anybody... Its true."
'Why not? I would love to see that.'
'13% are morons. 20% are morons, but so are 13%.'
'I‚Äôm stealing this.'

"Jr: Daddy, Bubba's tyrin to make me his bitch ...\n\n\nPrisoner, 5847355: Shudd-up and keep punching licence plates ..."
"I want an arrest warrant.  Til that happens, these articles don't mean anything."
'Is this what the Trump campaign was bleating about when they accused Obama of wiretapping during the campaign?'
'I‚Äôm curious...how bad is this for Jr?'
'Unless the wiretap was illegal ;)'
'Remember a question for a 15 year old son?  That was mine!!  I couldn‚Äôt even hear the response because I was sobbing.  My son, however, took notes.  He joked that someone said something about contemporaneous note-taking.  :-)'

"State charges are almost guaranteed. Even if it's money laundering or unrelated financial charges."
"It's Arrested Development."
"I'd make a list of all of his top level administration that should be jailed, but at this point it would probably be more efficient to just list those that *shouldn't* be jailed. "
"Indeed. Ain't no point getting rid of one evil head."
"I actually don't mind their breakfast, everything else sucks though."
'He said "–î–∞, —è —Ö–æ—Ç–µ–ª —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –æ–Ω –≤—ã–∏–≥—Ä–∞–ª.", which literally means "Yes, I wanted him to win". The translator messed up at the beginning.'
'Makes sense to me that he would support a candidate pro-russia instead of someone who would want to go to war with Russia...\n\n'
'Cold war'
"That's what I assumed was happening. I don't believe for a second that Putin is so stupid as to blatantly admit to influencing the American election, during a press conference, with the American president standing next to him."
'Thanks for this. I was a little suspicious of the translation, it kind of sounded weird even when the translator was speaking it. Doubt Putin would be that stupid to just blatantly say "oh yeah I meddled in the US election".'
'Because this is just a small translation error, but something that changes the meaning greatly, especially when the video is cut. He said "–î–∞, —è —Ö–æ—Ç–µ–ª —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –æ–Ω –≤—ã–∏–≥—Ä–∞–ª.", which literally means "Yes, I wanted him to win", and I\'m not sure how this could be a surprise to anyone.'
'And one moron, you.'
"Trump ran part of his campaign on saying how weak America has been, now he wants America to be Putin's bitch."
'For whatever reason /r/news is a cesspool of red hat brigadiers. They flood the fuck out of any article which is remotely critical of dear leader.'
"Which can only be accomplished by America capitulating to Russia, since Russia has lost its circle of influence and might.\n\nHe's literally saying he wants the Cold War back and we should let him act like a fucking belligerent dictator. Trumps supporters are suddenly worried about WWIII after years of calling Obama a pussy.\n\nFrankly, with how crazy Russia is acting, I wonder if they are in a total shambles and this would be a great time to invade. Is Vlad hiding the secret that they lost their launch codes? The only nukes they now have are the ones they are testing now?\n\nNATO from the west and China and Japan from the east. It'll be over in week.\n\nOkay. I swear I'm not drunk.\n\n"
'Makes sense. But am I being downvoted to hell if that‚Äôs not being disputed üòÇ'
'Because trump is an idiot, if he was just more straight forward. '
'> I was more referring the fact that the translator ignored the part where he said ‚ÄúYes, I did want Trump to win‚Äù, simplifying it down to a simple ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.\n\nBut he didn\'t, he simply jumped the gun after the "Da" from Putin by translating it right away as "Yes, i did!". And then had to repeat the "Yes" so the rest of Putin\'s response would make sense as a full phrase.  '
'I thought it died with thunderous applause.'
'It‚Äôs not even one lie at a time. It‚Äôs all day every day and several at a time. \n\nI get updates from politifact from time to time and Trump tells 6.4 lies per day. '
'And corporate media just plays along.  Gives credibility to this nonsense all while disregarding actual real news.'
"Trump the traitor who took 5 medical deferments will lay a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery today. That's a utter disgrace to all those who gave all. Donate, Volunteer and Vote. Also, God Speed Mueller "

'Then do something, Schiff. Stop being complicit and whiny about it.'

'> Stop being complicit and whiny about it.\n\ngo away, troll.'
"Read that aloud.\n\n>Trump has FBI informants in his campaign.\n\nMaybe because he's a criminal and a traitor?"

'most are old enough to avoid service, or rich enough to know its for young suckers with nothing to loose aka the class their businesses often perpetuate with low wages... '
'maybe he has other lies'
'Maybe they can still have time to edit it to say it is a f****** lie along with these other hundred lies'
'Because some people listen to him and believe every word he says. The same thing happened with Trump - CNN gave him a lot of air time and yet his insane words only brought him more voters.'
'God people on the left are pathetic, its just amazing you have less awareness of how moronic you sound than the idiots in the far right. '
"If you need an example then you haven't been paying attention. \n\nRead the book I've mentioned in other posts, if you read it with an open mind it should scare you. \n\nWe've all been played by both sides, when they have us under control it will be too late. "
"Everyone I don't agree with is a Russian bot\n\nA story for liberals or children"
'Muh personal gunnarea war'
"I like that idea because it makes a lot of sense, but that's not the way things seem to happen at this point. Even if something works (based on available evidence), many people fight tooth and nail to avoid change. That's what conservativism appears to have morphed into for a large number of folks, and it's super depressing. "
'>  the left is much more subtle playing the long con and are willing to wait the people out till they willfully accept giving up total control.\n\nRight, "the left" is the ones trying to cram their personal hell of a religion down our throats.\n\nThe "left" is the religious crazy type of zealots that fly airplanes into buildings.\n\n/s'

"I was never debating whether or not Hannity believes it. I was pointing out that the quote came from Newt, not Hannity. Reading anything else into what I stated came from you all. I wasn't secretly trying to make anybody here believe Hannity disagreed. I was simply pointing out the flaw in this post and most of it's comments.\n\nI guess pointing out discrepancies and backing them up with factual evidence gets you downvoted in this sub too. Oh well...\n\nEdit: words"
'Putin didnt know we had a secret weapon called Mueller.'
'Hello I am just a youngling with no knowledge of politics whatsoever. If Trump is impeached what happens to all the damage he‚Äôs already done? All the people he put into office and the Paris deal thing involving global warming. I think Pence gets to be president if Trumps impeached, but does that really make it all better?'
'Holy crap this explains so much.'
'Not to mention how there were single-digit instances of actual voter fraud in 2016, half of whom were people trying to prove how easy it is to commit voter fraud and got caught.'
"Having a national ID and requiring it to vote would help... But too many politicians wouldn't like that."
'And then nothing will happen as everyone just points to Bill Clinton lying.  I hope I‚Äôm wrong.  '
'Like how they got Capone on tax evasion because he covered up his extortion, murder, etc. too well.'
"Its always the cover up. Smart people in Washington already knew that- its how people like Clinton avoid things that are criminally damaging. Once the FBI starts looking you'd better stop playing games, or you'll go to prison just for that."
'No, this will take a generation at least to be repaired - all of the judges he appoints as president are life time appointments. Republicanism as it is today needs to be eradicated if America wants to be known for anything other than greed. '
'Why just cut the head off when you can dice the entire beast?\n\nMueller is working from the bottom up.'
"Your not completely wrong. We have no idea how much evidence he has and on who. We can make pretty educated guesses based on the publicly available evidence. It's hard to believe we won't see an indictment of a figure higher up then Micheal Flynn, based on the guilty pleas we've seen so far. That narrows the possibilities quite a bit. The fact that Trumps campaign manager is being charged with Conspiracy against the United States  helps support that educated guess. It's been less than a year and we've already had quite a few high level indictments. None of the testimony from any of the plea deals has come to light so far. You can be damn sure their will be an indictment that includes that testimony. Might not be Trump directly but I highly doubt the Trump family makes it out of this unscathed. "

"It appears that was before he actually became president. The list I made above doesn't include incidents prior to inauguration. Even so, it doesn't matter whether Trump is part of the list or not.

'AFAIK, Trump explicitly told Comey that he did not stay a night in Moscow. Whether this could be considered obstruction of justice or perjury is up for debate, since he wasn‚Äôt being formally questioned at the time. But in the light of the rest of the Russia probe, it seems suspicious that he would try to minimize his time there. If nothing untoward happened in the two days he spent in Moscow, why would he try to say he spent less time there?'

'  Note: not full article.\n\n\n>It is a scandal that more than one year after President Trump assumed office, dozens of officials serving in highly sensitive posts have not yet received full security clearances.\n\n>It appears many of them might never receive full security clearances, and only now are the American people and Congress discovering how and why this unprecedented situation occurred and continues today.\n\n>Normally, the time frame for obtaining security clearances for officials serving in highly sensitive posts takes two, three or four months at most.\nHistorically, the time frame for many of these clearances begins during the transition period when the identity of many important individuals serving in these posts is known by the president-elect and his transition managers.\n\n>The situation surrounding former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, who has been accused of spousal abuse by two former wives and never received a full security clearance after many months of vetting, has brought the larger security clearance scandal to national attention. \n\n>The question of what the president and his White House chief of staff knew about this matter, and when they knew it, is part of a larger problem that creates serious and continuing national security dangers for the nation.\n\n>The White House staff secretary is one of the most important jobs in an administration, involving daily access to the most sensitive secrets of state, and must be held by someone who can be fully trusted with the most classified information and fully protected from being potentially blackmailed by our nation‚Äôs enemies and others who wish us ill.

'incompetence at its finest! '
"Because that debt can be used as leverage against you. \n\nIt's a very reasonable thing to reject security clearance for."
'Only the president does not need a security clearance, because he\'s the president. All of the other do need them. It\'s highly unusual for someone to work with a temporary clearance for more than a couple of months. For "dozens" to be working with temporary clearances for over a year is...well, it\'s nuts.'
'Yes, the FBI, led by a Republican, started an investigation based on things that a Republican adviser said, got some research commissioned by a Republican news outlet, and used this as a part of a FISA warrant application on Trump\'s "coffee boy". This warrant was then approved by a FISC judge appointed by a Republican (John Roberts), and was then renewed more than once by officials appointed by Trump (Rosenstein, Boente).\n\nThat\'s why it\'s a conspiracy by the Democrats!\n\n'

"I'm not defending the guy and certainly not the accusations, but what I haven't been able to figure out is why domestic abuse would negate one's ability to get clearance. Do you have any input there? "
'You\'re allowed to hold and express political opinions. Just not while representing yourself as a member of the military or commenting on military matters. "I think that..." is okay, "As an Army Captain, I think that..." is not.\n\nI stick to discussing fact when trending into such topics. Sometimes those facts don\'t reflect well on a particular statement, but they\'re usually just numbers or historical observations or reviews of how the law actually works.\n\nIt\'s a fine balancing act for me. I work in media (tech journalism) and occasionally have to touch on politics in my work, so I have to stick to the dispassionate facts. I\'m no top-tier YouTuber or anything, but I am still a public persona and make a point to be myself, publicly, at all times. I just sometimes have to keep a few opinions to my close personal circle and not public air any grievances I may have.'

'Don\'t know if this has been shared already, but there\'s this podcast called "Opening Arguments" that has devoted two episodes to the Stormy Daniels stuff (episodes 154 & 155). I\'m just a layman with no legal knowledge, but from what these guys are saying (one of the hosts is an actual lawyer), this whole thing could play out to where Trump would be in legit trouble. Like, worst than Bill Clinton. And it wouldn\'t just be because he committed adultery with a porn star. \n\nHere\'s the podcast right here: https://openargs.com/'
"Could have been worse...... could have been rape allegations like Clinton\n\nrape allegations\n\nNot sex between two consensual adults but RAPE!!\n\nplus the TWO sexual relations WHILST President\n\nhow weird you guys don't bring that up"
"I'm sure anyone donating will be doing so to hurt Trump, not help Daniels."
"Prudent to see what happens at that hearing before dropping $$$, there are more needy people than a porn star who took the money and now wants a do over because she and her lawyers think she can get her grubby hands on more money.\nI'm not saying she's wrong and Trump is right, I'm saying based on the circumstances I personally don't think she deserves financial assistance given the amount of need and poverty that is currently otherwise out there."

"More to the point, while she can in theory speak out in violation of the NDA to tell her story, if she were to put out a book without first invalidating the NDA, 100% of the book's proceeds would likely go to Trump (or Cohen?) rather than Stormy."
"I could swear I read yesterday that neither Trump nor the Notary had signed the NDA.  If that is the case, it has no legal bearing whatsoever.\n\nBut, I've been working on taxes and may be confusing it with something else."
'NDA might be tossed out because it is being used to cover a crime (adultery is laughably a crime in new york). So theoretically if she has good lawyers she can tell all with an air of legal protection.'
'I totally agree with you. Just because one greedy person is slightly less abhorrent than the other does not mean I have to root for either one of them.'

"Like I said, in general you'd have to pay a buttload of money as penalty for breaking an NDA, I'm not saying that is Stormy's plan. Stormy is trying to take the legal route and be legally released from her NDA so that she is allowed to speak about the affair. Since she's taking it to court, she can reasonably predict how much this lawsuit will cost her. The money she is asking for is to finance her lawsuit, not to finance any penalties for breaking the NDA. "

'So does it not strike you as strange that a special counsel assigned to find evidence of Russian collusion has found no such evidence in over a year of investigations? He‚Äôs gone so far outside the scope of the investigation that it‚Äôs plain as day they‚Äôll stop at nothing until SOMETHING is found. If that doesn‚Äôt scream political motivation, then I‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt have the time or the crayons to explain it to you. How would you feel if you were indicted... no, merely accused of tax fraud and an investigator found no such evidence, but kept searching for something, ANYTHING to convict you of something? Because that‚Äôs the direction our ‚Äújustice‚Äù department is going if you tollorate and encourage this behavior. '

"They shouldn't have to. You know that nonsense you said was just that.\n\nYou wouldn't understand a response anyway "
'A few questions. \n\n1. How do you know he\'s found nothing? You don\'t know what he has or hasn\'t found, just that he hasn\'t released his findings or directly charged anyone for crimes directly relating to collusion in the election. \n\n2. How has he strayed "so far outside of the scope that it\'s plain they\'ll stop at nothing"? EVERY person who has been charged has been charged for crimes related to.... wait for it... inappropriate dealings with Russia (or lying to the FBI about those dealings). EVERY SINGLE ONE. \n\nIt\'s simply mindblowing to think that an investigation into russian collusion that finds other crimes involving Russia is somehow considered off topic. And it\'s absurdly naive to think that Mueller would lay his cards on the table by charging any of the parties with something directly tied to the election when he still has plenty of cards to play, witnesses to interview, and leads to follow. \n\nHe\'s not going to tip Trump off by charging Manafort with something tied directly to the election before he even talks to Trump. That\'s what smart people call counterproductive. \n\n\nEdit: \n\nIf nothing else, the raiding of Trump\'s attorney\'s office shows that Mueller is quite concerned about the limits of his scope. After all, he referred it back to the FBI, rather than taking it on himself. \n'

The article is specious on its face as Levin is confusing positions\n\n>The Constitutional Clause Levin is referring to is administrative positions and cabinet level positions. Mueller was hired as an attorney, a prosecutor, and does not have the level of authority that would trip an administrative position clause.\n\n>That\'s why Mueller\'s position is overseen by Rosenstein and the Attorney Generals office, who do fit the description of the Executive Appointment Levin is referring to.\n\n>Most legal experts would say that Mueller\'s position cannot be directly fired by the President, as he was not appointed by him, and only the AG\'s office can do that. The President has the authority to fire anybody at an Executive position at his will, as they serve at his pleasure, but its was quite clear that Mueller\'s position would require a "for cause" finding, which means he would have to do something that violated the terms of employment of his position.\n\n>Levin wants to put Mueller in an executive position, but have none of the independent freedom(Mueller reports to Rosenstein) it is entitled to.\n\n>This is typical of Levin who uses his knowledge of the law to obscure and twist facts for people not versed or unfamiliar with it.\n\n>When confronted, he usually combats it with "its my opinion" which is probably why he does not actively practice law.\n\n'

"Are they starting to crack? I've been sure they will eventually but my faith in both logic and humanity itself have been strained by the ordeal of the Dump Regime."
"This isn't necessarily true. DoJ guidelines say that a sitting president can't be indicted, and it seems likely that Mueller would follow them, but some lawyers have argued that this conclusion is inaccurate, that a president who was an active participant in a criminal conspiracy could 100% be indicted just like anyone else. If Mueller decides he agrees with them he'll probably hold onto that as a last resort, but he'd definitely rather have Rosenstein present his findings to congress."

I'm talking tens, if not hundreds of thousands of documents. It's entirely possible that they already have most, if not all of what they're subpoenaing and they just want to see what gets omitted so they can file a felony False Statements charge to flip another witness.\n\nSubpoenas are extremely aggressive, like approaching Manafort's no-knock search warrant aggressive, so given the political attention this probe is getting they probably don't send them out until they're confident that something is being concealed from them."
"Well, who's NOT on the list? Kushner\n\nEither he is the witness himself, or his communications with this individual are unimportant, and given the other people mentioned in this subpeona I find it hard to believe the latter."
"I think it has to be another explanation. \n\nRick Gates has already pleaded. Manafort has already been indicted, yet Mueller keeps dropping charges on him, and wants his documents.\n\nFor all we've seen, he would turn the White House upside down if only to add a day's count to someone."

However, there is no archaeological evidence of the story itself, in either Egypt or Sinai, and what has been perceived as historical evidence from Egyptian sources can be interpreted differently.

'They threatened her baby daughter. '
'>According to Daniels, Mr. Trump called her the following month to say **he\'d not been able to get her a spot on Celebrity Apprentice.** She says they never met again and **only had sex in that first meeting in 2006**. In May 2011, Daniels agreed to tell her story to a sister publication of In Touch magazine for $15,000 dollars. Two former employees of the magazine told us the story never ran because after the magazine called Mr. Trump seeking comment, his attorney Michael Cohen threatened to sue. Daniels says she was never paid, and says a few weeks later, she was threatened by a man who approached her in Las Vegas.\n\n>Stormy Daniels: I was in a parking lot, going to a fitness class with my infant daughter. T-- taking, you know, the seats facing backwards in the backseat, diaper bag, you know, gettin\' all the stuff out. And a guy walked up on me and said to me, **"Leave Trump alone. Forget the story."** And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, **"That\'s a beautiful little girl. It\'d be a shame if something happened to her mom."** And then he was gone.'

A deposed president, House and Senate in chaos, and worldwide attention to a country where everybody is looking for blood one way (justice for the crooked crony) or another (revenge against the Deep State). \n\nIn the long run, I don't know what the better decision would be. He might not be looking forward to long-term retaliation in the form of trade restrictions and an economical repeat of the Cold War (or, if things really get out of hand, military aggression), but he's probably not done with his plans for the USA (and the rest of the world) either.

'Nunberg is also a close associate of Roger Stone, and he advised Donald Trump since early 2014. Nunberg was terminated on August 2, 2015. But before he was fired, in July 2016, Trump accused Nunberg of violating a confidentiality agreement and sought $10 million from Nunberg. According to The Hill, Trump accused Nunberg of leaking a story about a dispute between former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and spokeswoman Hope Hicks. Nunberg claimed that the arbitration was part of the campaign\'s attempts to "silence" him after he endorsed Ted Cruz. On August 11, 2016, Nunberg and Trump settled on an agreement that could not be relitigated, according to Politico. But for it to be Nunberg, the questions I have are, why the November 1st, 2015 date for the emails? And what happened after that date that was of significance to the investigation?'

Oops, we can't and never will because conveniently, these are all foreign nationals who will never set foot in a US courtroom.

He\'s also publicly admitted on Twitter and other public comments about why he fired Comey (to stop an investigation, which is absolutely considered obstruction). Some have claimed trump didn\'t write those himself, but there\'s no way someone with an ego like his would let someone else use *his* twitter, since that\'s a primary source of ego stroking for him.  \n\nWitness tampering would be the next easiest to prove, as Bannon\'s council was literally talking to someone in the whitehouse during his initial voluntary testimony about what questions he should answer and how he should answer them. It\'s doubtful they were dumb enough to do it again in front of Mueller in his more recent visits, though. \n\nA better breakdown of these things is found on [Seth Abramson\'s twitter](https://twitter.com/SethAbramson/).

But if you include any corruption charges in Congress, it starts to even out. '
'Honest, it‚Äôs a little bit ridiculous. '
'It is the judicial branch not the supreme court.'
'Can an attorney represent a defendant and be a witness for the prosecution at the same time? \n\nGiuliani says, Hold my beer.'
"The writers are getting so lazy this season. The president's personal attorney just happens to confess to obstruction of justice? Come on, guys, stop phoning it in. No one would believe that."
'I wonder if Giuliani is setting this up as a sort of precedent for Trump to fire Rosenstein for the same thing'
'In Giuliani\'s case, it may be his only course of action in order to avoid becoming a target of one of the probes himself. He\'s got his fingerprints all over the "October Surprise". '
'And how is it that there‚Äôs so damn many of them?'
"I believe you're correct there. Trump didn't play nice with Comey, so he wasn't going to do him any favors."
"can't admit they were duped.  \n\n"
'Your source is an article with no sources, written in a way that makes it appear to be heavily pro trump?'

'9\\-11 came right when it was needed to cover the 2.3 Trillion taxpayer dollars "lost" from the budget under Bush.\n\nDo not think the current neocons won\'t attack America the same way.'
"I'm not sure I follow. Are you a 9/11 truther?"
'I thought his tweet about ZTE and saving Chinese jobs was odd until I read this.'
"There are far too many potential conflicts of interest for Trump to be President and he's far too weak a human being not to succumb to temptation. "
'The new normal.... Who needs politics or diplomats...\n\nJust cut to the chase and bribe Trump. '
'Bet they find her with two heart attacks, right to the back of the head. '
'Methinks this would have already happened if her story want absolutely bullshit '
"Basically, the upcoming elections are made to re-elect Putin for next 6 years (and then for 6 more years if he'll be alive at this point): they forbid Alexey Navalny to particiate in this election because he was previously convicted (look up 'Kirovles case', it's full of bullshit and was fabricated just to deny him to be ever elected); the other candidates are all worthless and they are here just to imitate 'real' election.\n\nSo Alexey is calling for voter strike because it will show that people do not accept this election and do not want to see the dictator for another 12 years.\n\nFunny, but the voting paper looks like this: https://cont.ws/uploads/pic/2018/2/ab6b5f680c2488e9736c73969db81715.jpg\n\nYou should get the idea where to sign without even knowing Russian."
"It's her teeth.\n\nI think she's drop dead gorgeous until she opens her mouth."
'Eyes are lil strange to. I dig it. Slap her in a shitty trailer and you got yourself a r/trashyboners going '
'I‚Äôm confused, are they trying to prove that a deep state exists, or are they trying to show how the GOP folded and let Trump move on them like a bitch after the election?'
'Damn this is satisfying.'
'Shots fired! '
"I can't fucking believe he had to ask these question just because a bunch of high school drop outs started to vote."
'üòÇ wtf. Should be posted to the quacking Donald'
'What was the point of this?   Raskin has turned out to be a rank disappointment.  I will never vote for another Bernie endorsed candidate again- they Turned into Hillary bots in no time flat.   '
'That‚Äôs why you always leave snacks at your desk. To poison them! \n\nBelladonna dusted almonds are tariff-free and easy to make. '
'Sarcasm is hard. You would think the ‚Äúlocker room talk‚Äù gave it away, but... ü§∑üèª\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è'
'Pretty goddamn obvious that Trump himself was the one who leaked the list. '
'All I feel is confusion nowadays...'
'To quote what Nixon said on his tapes "We better pay those cocksuckers off or they\'ll be in jail pissing on each other."'
"You stupid fuckin' libtards; it makes us innocent when we do it and when you do it makes you look guilty.  Why don't you get that you fuckin' commie pussies? /s"
"Wow, so it's just a right to remain silent, and the Jury can make of it what they will?  That doesn't sound like a good move to pull unless you're well and truly stuffed no matter what.\n\nThanks for the info!"
"It still served well to fight against corrupt officials who want to jail people using crazy courts, and for innocent people that have fear to the prosecutors. Imagine being forced to say something fabricated against yourself. This amendment can protect you from doing exactly that. It also protect innocent people from getting their life entirely ruined by the lawsuits, so yeah, it still serve it purpose, although some lawsuits showed that courts today can use it against you depend on the situation, like if it's just to remain mute for the entire questioning, or at least you can't claim that someone violated your fifth right if you decided to stay silent."
'We might just need to be more forceful. A general strike would get the ball rolling. You‚Äôd notice *some* changes RIGHT AWAY. Depending on how determined the enemy, we may need to strike longer, but the effects of a general strike could be enough to get the ball rolling.\n\nOther things might start happening at that point. Good things, if you know what I‚Äôm saying; good things such as unity, a sense of real community, racial togetherness, the lifting of morale for all citizens, and the exposure of what lies in the darkness. ..good things.'
'I think the point is not impeachment, what winning the senate will do is allow trump to be openly. Investigated.  None of his buddies will be able to give deposition in private, the democrats could unilaterally release evidence the republicans are holding back, etc.'
'Keep wasting your life trolling.'
'Hell, America is still stuck with Nixon.'

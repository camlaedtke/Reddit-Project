Here's a reminder that President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein were accused of violently raping a 13-year-old girl at an orgy in the 90s. She had to eventually drop the lawsuit due to fear for her life.
Trump struggling to find lawyers to represent him as Mueller investigation enters critical phase
If Trump Fires Mueller, We Must Impeach: The country will find itself in a constitutional crisis, where the executive branch rejects checks and balances and the rule of law
Cohen's lawyer: Trump lying is abuse of power and 'an impeachable offense'
'Nobody knew criminal conspiracy could be so complicated!'
"haha, guy can't get criminal defense lawyers to rep him b/c \n\n1. he's guilty\n\n2. he's an unethical fraud who doesn't pay his bills\n\n3. he's too stupid to listen to council and not incriminate himself or commit perjury\n\n\n"
"Trump is a living representation of legal abuse and, frankly, the american bar association bloody hates the fucking guy. at this point, the only reason anyone would represent him is because you support him. Unfortunately, this leads to his other problem. He needs a lawyer that isn't horseshit and doesn't rely on money from Fox TV punditry. What Trump *really* needs is a lawyer with a superpower that will convince him to shut the fuck up so he can get a decent plea deal. What Trump *thinks* he needs is a television attack dog. He's just behaving... so. fucking. stupidly. They say that when we get stressed or angry it can reduce your capacity to think critically. We have never seen someone so inept at the basic adult skill of calming down in the oval before."
'The Trump stink is really difficult to wash off'
"No no, it's because ***THE LEFT*** will say mean things about any lawyer who takes the case so they're scared to do it.\n\n...because lawyers aren't accustomed to being hated by the public."
'Bannon is stealing them all cause he hates trump!  According to my infowars and Breitbart sources!! /s'
'He doesn’t need a criminal lawyer. He needs a criminal, lawyer. '
'His problem is he\'s notorious for not paying his bills. He\'s hired lawyers who\'ve had to sue him for their legal fees on more than one occasion. While he\'s also the legal client from hell (constitutionally incapable of keeping his mouth shut for his own good), he\'d have SOME takers if there weren\'t any questions about whether he\'d pay his legal bills—at that point he\'d be able to find people who would take the payday and deal with figuring out how to deflect the legal loss onto "he was an idiot and impossible client" later.'
'He probably damn near admits guilt in his first interview and scares them off. '
"Holy shit. I couldn't finish watching those videos I was cringing so hard. How does this guy have a law degree?"
"This guy isn't the kind of lawyer that will tell ridiculous lies to your face no matter how much a roomful of people can tell it's bullshit.  No.  But Michael Cohen's the kinda lawyer *who'd give you the shirt of his back.*  We're talking about *that* kind of lawyer.\n\n\n**wow.**"
"(I'm not a lawyer, but!) This case is astonishingly simple. Trump is guilty and so is his lawyer. You gotta be deaf, blind and straight-up retarded not to understand that. \n\nHow do you make a contract on behalf of another person without the latter's approval? If Cohen did it on behalf on an imaginary 'DD' person, then the whole NDA deal is fiction. \n\nIf Trump is innocent, then why not go after Stormy and file a libel suit? Which leads to [*this*](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/10/577100238/trump-again-blasts-libel-laws-calling-them-as-a-sham) imo. "
"Even Megan Kelly is tired of this shit. \nCan't wait to see Schwartz's lawyer on TV next. "
'Well, not everybody has a legal defense fund financed by foreign governments, Puerto Rican terrorists, and drug traffickers. '
'Screw this. If she\'s marketing herself as a tool, and that tool comes over to help my side, why would I object? It just means that her reporting is for sale... and that should surprise exactly nobody. She was employed to present stories for Fox News. Fox News sells right-wing bullshit, so don\'t be so surprised that an employee of Fox News was shoveling right-wing bullshit. \n\nYou guys all do understand that the dude on Fox currently who is lauded as "sane" and "stands up to bullshit" is just a marketing ploy to get more people to watch Fox, right? Fox is a business and they sell to the hard right and the soft right-middle. That particular dude is on Fox so that Slate Magazine will write stories about a Fox story involving a reporter who "doesn\'t stand for bullshit". Employees of Fox work for Fox. We should be lauding the people who leave that and join an organization that sells less bullshit. \n\nYou also understand that now that she\'s on NBC, she\'ll employ her craft to sell what NBC wants to sell to NBC\'s customers. How hard is it to understand that an employee\'s personal beliefs and opinions are not what a company sells you? Fact is, only Kelly\'s close friends and associates knows her personal beliefs and opinions. She\'s good at what she does because she makes you all believe her. \n\nWelcome to the world. Don\'t be so naive; looks bad. '
'“Pepper spray is just a food product, essentially.”\n\nYeah that kind of shit is a little hard to forget.'
'Repent and sin no more.'
"Megyn Kelly as a person can go fuck herself. Megyn Kelly as a TV personality who cares as long as she's exposing their bullshit and getting views why do we need to be pissy about her past? It makes no difference. Speaking truth to power is important even if the person doing it is an empty sycophantic troglodyte."
'This lawyer is a sack of shit. And his clients and their clients to all the way up the chain are sacks of shit. They are the exact people who make the world as shit as it is. '
'That was so painful to watch...omg lol, that was just fking brutal, he should have been chewed out more'
"You know, poison *can* cause seizures.\n\nWe're going to pull through this.  It's truly not our fault - outside influences manipulated sad, vulnerable people into voting for him.  He didn't even get the most votes."
"What?!? No he's not. Like, at all. What makes you believe he's doing a good job?\n\nSpeaking as an attorney, this clown Schwartz couldn't have done much worse. I get that Cohen is an ethically challenged and odious client who has a documented history of making threats and behaving in an extremely unprofessional, thuggish manner. Which obviously makes representing him problematic. However, Schwartz is unable to make arguments that aren't laughable. Moreover, it appears to me that he was unprepared for the interview. It wouldn't have been difficult to anticipate the questions/topics discussed and craft reasonable, articulate, and considered responses. Schwartz did none of this. Ultimately, he came away as a lazy, dumb, and totally ineffectual legal representative. "
'>Kushner’s legal team looks to hire crisis public relations firm amid Russia probe\n\nThis makes me chuckle to see how clueless these people are.  Kushner\'s problem isn\'t a public relations issue.  Kushner\'s problem is a "he committed crimes" issue.  '
'“The office of American innovation” give me a fucking break with shit. This ding dong could’t innovate a dildo if it was ten feet up his ass. '
'I love how you all circle jerk over stories based on "people familiar with the matter" from sites like Washington Post even though they\'re shot down every single time. Do you ever get tired of being wrong? Do you ever wonder if you\'re being spoon-fed bullshit every day?'
'Well, it is common for people who get caught up in white collar criminal probes to hire these sorts of firms even if they are guilty.  They must be expecting an indictment.  And the Cambridge Analytica stuff is most interesting.'

'>  Kushner\'s problem isn\'t a public relations issue. Kushner\'s problem is a "he committed crimes" issue. \n\nBut, he can\'t fix the "he committed crimes" issue.  Short of Trump and other traitors screwing the whole society, he and others are fucked.  To be clear, they ***SHOULD*** be fucked because of what they have done, and if the right thing happens they will be prosecuted.  Yet, there is no guarantee that will happen.  It has to, though, even to the point of being cruel to marginal actors, so that nobody who thinks themselves clever is encouraged to step up and strip any citizen of their inalienable rights.  If the complaint is that many of those citizens aren\'t qualified to vote, then the effort should be on making the qualified and not manipulating them through propaganda to \'make them do\' anything.'
'Seriously. This is like dumber versions of the dumb and greedy people on Arrested Development. Too good to make up. '
"I'm still not clear what he's done that would really be indictable.  Unless he lied to the FBI too.  They are all dumb enough to do that.\n\nWould Mueller be going after him for Logan Act violations?"
'No.  Plus the same guy also sent antihilary msgs which is not getting reported.  It’s almost like these people are manipulating evidence to serve their own ends.  They have no clue how smart Mueller is, being so stupid themselves.'
'They think if they can sway public opinion enough, they can discredit investigators and get out of charges.  And with their idiot base, it might work.'
'Beep beep beep. I am a Ruskie bot sent to wind you up. Downvote me to hell '
'How exactly would that change the fact that treason is treason? '
'The articles I’m reading are saying that the GOP is trying to shield Trump by hampering his investigation and pressuring key witnesses to not show up to hearings scheduled by the probe. This is scary to me and it reeks of authoritarianism on the GOP’s part. I really want Mueller to finish his work. '
'> Just like every other thing he\'s been involved in for the last several decades.\n\nFor accuracy\'s sake. \n\nOne might stop to think for a minute "but hey, he got himself elected president. that\'s a pretty big win, right?" and for any other human being in the history of the world, you\'d probably be right. but i think it will ultimately be the one thing that makes his life worse than any other decision he\'s ever made. you don\'t get to kill yourself slowly with Big Macs and two scoops of ice cream in federal prison.

'2 year old account, 3 posts, poor english. I guess all the good russian bots and shills are busy pushing the release the memo bullshit. '
"Of course they won't. If anything, one or two low level employees will maybe get in trouble but that's all. Look at what happened in 2008. One fucking person was charged. One."
"You're not concerned that every last person who would possibly know say the Trump campaign helped Putin steal the US election. I'm not concerned when a couple Republicans, proven liars and cheaters as an entire party, shouts they have secret information they can't tell us that will get Rosenstein fired so they can fire Mueller."
'How is this spying on political opposition?\n\nAre police “spying” on suspects when an overwhelming amount of evidence points to their guilt in a crime?\n\nFollow your logic above through: cops aren’t ever investigating; they are spying. Very odd position to take. '
'Maybe i read it wrong. Wasnt OP questioning the commissions integrity, not deutsche bank?\n\nExit- yea im an idiot. I misread the title and didnt realize the scrutany was aimed at DB.'
"Trolling? There are Congressmen who have read the memo and are sickened by the actions of the Obama administration, FBI, and DOJ. They are saying it's worse than Watergate! If it's true, wouldn't you, not as a Trump hater but as an american, be worried? "
'You missed the word illegal. '
'Republican congressmen. Who have lost ALL credibility since trump took control. They’re all his damn stooges and lackeys and not a single one of them has an ounce of integrity. \n\nI’ll be voting straight ticket D for the first time EVER this November. It makes me sick, but this shit is un-american. The republicans have had a full year to stop it and have chosen not to. '
"How is it illegal for a presidential candidate to collude with the FBI and DOJ to obtain an unverified and fake dossier. Then use that fake dossier to obtain a FISA warrant to illegally spy on your opposition. Then illegally unmask the identities of the people who were illegally spied on. You're right, it's like a cop pulling someone over for speeding. How odd..."
'\n\nIm not sure... In addition the the examples below I will add that CNN, after the election, was caught interviewing a random voter who later was revealed to be their camera man and cutting to a blank screen whenever a guest opposes their narrative.  "Oh no, that sucks".  Below is why they are known as "Clinton News Network" and "Chicken Noodle News". \n\n\n\nCoverage of the 2016 U.S. presidential election\n\nOn April 3, 2016, hundreds of supporters of\xa0Bernie Sanders\xa0protested outside of CNN\xa0Los Angeles. Sanders supporters were protesting\xa0CNN\'s coverage of the\xa02016 United States presidential elections, specifically in regards to the lack of airtime Sanders has received. Known as Occupy CNN, protesters claimed that\xa0major media networks\xa0have intentionally blacked out Sanders\'\xa0presidential campaign\xa0in favor of giving much more airtime to candidates such as\xa0Hillary Clinton.\n\nDonna Brazile and Roland MartinEdit\n\nIn October 2016,\xa0WikiLeaks\xa0published\xa0emailsfrom\xa0John Podesta\xa0which showed CNN contributor\xa0Donna Brazile\xa0passing the questions for a CNN-sponsored debate to the Clinton campaign. In the email, Brazile discussed her concern of Clinton\'s ability to field a question regarding the death penalty. The following day Clinton would receive the question about the death penalty, verbatim from an audience member at the CNN-hosted Town Hall event.[14]\xa0According to a\xa0CNNMoney\xa0investigation, the debate moderator\xa0Roland Martin\xa0of\xa0TV One\xa0"did not deny sharing information with Brazile."CNN severed ties with Brazile on October 14, 2016.\n\nWikileaks emailsEdit\n\nCNN anchor\xa0Chris Cuomo\xa0said on a live coverage of the 2016 elections that downloading the\xa0Podesta emails\xa0from the\xa0Wikileaks\xa0website was illegal, and that only the media could legally do so. The statement drew criticism to the network for being false.\n\nTrump administration coverage\n\nOn January 10, 2017, CNN reported on the existence of classified documents that said Russia had compromising personal and financial information about then President-elect\xa0Donald Trump. CNN did not publish\xa0the dossier, or any specific details of the dossier. Later that day,\xa0BuzzFeed\xa0published the entire 35-page dossier with a disclaimer that it was unverified and "includes some clear errors".\xa0The dossier had been read widely by political and media figures in Washington, and had been sent to multiple other journalists who had declined to publish it as it was unsubstantiated.At a press conference the following day, Trump referred to CNN as\xa0fake news\xa0and refused to take a question from CNN reporter\xa0Jim Acosta.\n\n\n\nOn June 26, 2017, three network investigative journalists; Thomas Frank,\xa0Eric Lichtblau, and Lex Haris, resigned from CNN over a false story, later retracted, that connected\xa0Anthony Scaramucci\xa0to a $10 billion Russian investment fund. The network apologized to Scaramucci and stated that the online story did not meet their\xa0editorial standards.\n\nOn November 6, 2017, CNN ran a story entitled "Trump asks Japan to build cars in the U.S. It already does."\xa0The story included only a partial quote from President Trump stating that he would like Japan (more) to make cars in America. However, CNN originally omitted the remainder of his statement congratulating two Japanese automakers for investing more money in the US to build another factory. The Washington Post took notice and criticized the report.The Post called the headline "snarky," and told the network, and others, to stop "cherry-picking the quote." CNN later changed the quote and the headline, issuing the following correction: "The original version of this article and its headline did not make clear that President Trump had praised Japanese automakers for expanding existing U.S. facilities and for making new investments in the U.S. The article and headline have been updated."\xa0\n\nThe Washington Post again fact-checked a CNN report regarding Trump on December 8, 2017: CNN ran a story that claimed two sources told the network that the Trump campaign received an email that gave Trump and his son Don Jr early access to Wikileaks documents on September 4, 2016. CNN had not obtained the supposed September 4th email. The sender was "Michael J. Erickson", who CNN was not able to contact.\xa0The Washington Post, however, did obtain the email, which showed that the email was actually sent on the day after the hacked documents were released by WikiLeaks--September 14, 2016.\xa0CNN issued a correction their story.\n\nThe network also imposed new rules on Russia related stories being published to social, video, editorial, or MoneyStream without going through the chain of command within CNN.\n\n\nPersian Gulf War\n\nDuring the\xa0Persian Gulf War, CNN was criticized for excessively pushing\xa0human interest stories\xa0and avoiding depictions of violent images; the result of all this being an alleged "propagandistic" presentation of news.\xa0A report by\xa0Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting\xa0(FAIR) quotes an unnamed CNN reporter as describing "the \'sweet beautiful sight\' of bombers taking off from\xa0Saudi Arabia".\n\nCoverage of Iranian protests\n\nIn 2014, the network was criticized for an unusual absence of live coverage of a large set of protests that followed the\xa02014 elections in Iran.\n\nOperation TailwindEdit\n\nIn 1998, CNN, in partnership with sister\xa0Timemagazine, ran a report that\xa0Operation Tailwindin 1970 in Vietnam involved the use of\xa0Saringas to kill a group of\xa0defectors\xa0from the\xa0United States military.\xa0The Pentagon\xa0denied the story. Skeptics deemed it improbable that such an extraordinary and risky\xa0atrocity\xa0could have gone unnoticed at the height of the\xa0Vietnam War\'s unpopularity. CNN, after a two-week inquiry, issued a retraction. The story\'s producers were summarily fired, and one of them has been highly critical of CNN\'s handling of the story, saying that the network bowed to pressure from high-ranking officials to kill the story.\n\n\nJeff Zucker\n\nCNN was criticized for its coverage of the\xa0Boston Marathon bombings, after erroneously reporting that a "dark-skinned male" had been arrested in connection with the attack. In the aftermath of the broadcast,\xa0Jeff Zucker\xa0– who became president of CNN in 2013 – lauded the coverage, claiming that "CNN shined this week",\xa0and boasted ratings success that CNN achieved during the coverage, adding that "viewers respected the network\'s accountability when it admitted its mistakes". Jon Stewart criticized Zucker\'s comments after calling CNN\'s coverage of the\xa0Washington Navy Yard shooting\xa0"breathless wrongness", claiming that "The lesson they take from this is – it doesn\'t matter how much they betray our trust."\n\nFredricka Whitfield\n\nOn June 13, 2015, while discussing the\xa02015 attack on the Dallas police headquarters, host\xa0Fredricka Whitfield\xa0referred to the gunman, James Boulware, as "courageous and brave, if not crazy". The comment received immediate backlash and calls for her to apologize. The next day, Whitfield stated on air that she misspoke and in no way believed the gunman was courageous or brave. After the backlash continued, she issued another on-air apology on June 15, saying she terribly misused those words, now understood how offensive it was and was sincerely sorry.\n\nM.I.A. Interview\n\nIn June 2009, musician\xa0M.I.A.\xa0stated she did an hour-long interview with CNN condemning the mass bombing and\xa0Tamil\xa0civilian fatalities at the hands of Government forces in\xa0Sri Lanka\xa0in 16 weeks the same year, "and they cut it down to one minute and made it about my single\xa0Paper Planes. When I went to the\xa0Grammys, I saw the same reporter from CNN, and I was like, \'Why did you do that?\' And she said, \'Because you used the G-word.\'" "Genocide. I guess you\'re not allowed to say that on CNN"\n\nSteubenville High School rape case coverage\n\nCNN revealed the name of the 16-year-old victim on March 17 by broadcasting unedited footage of one of the convicted rapists\' post-conviction statements. This practice is against the\xa0Associated Pressguidelines for coverage.\n\nMilwaukee riots coverageEdit\n\nDuring the\xa02016 Milwaukee riots, CNN showed a clip of Sylville Smith\'s sister, Sherelle Smith, urging rioters: "Don\'t bring that violence here," and referred to her as calling for peace. The rest of her speech, which was not included in the broadcast, included the following: "Burning down shit ain\'t going to help nobody! Y\'all burning down shit we need in our community. Take that shit to the suburbs! Burn that shit down! We need our weave. I don\'t wear it, but we need it." After being called out for selective editing, a CNN reporter involved in the story tweeted that they had "shorthanded" the quote and posted a link to a corrected video on CNN\'s website, which began with the screen shot that read: "An earlier version of this story mischaracterized what the victim\'s sister was trying to convey. She was calling for peace in her community, urging the protesters to go elsewhere."\n\n\nSome controversy was created by the use of CNN on-air staff for fictionalized reports and broadcasts in the science-fiction movie\xa0Contact.\n\n\n\nIsrael–Gaza conflictEdit\n\nDuring the\xa02014 Gaza conflict, hundreds of protesters came to the\xa0Time Warner Center, where CNN\'s\xa0New York City\xa0production facilities and bureau are housed. Various people accused CNN of biased coverage during live interviews on the network.\n\nSemi-automatic weapons\n\nCNN apologized for a May 15, 2003, story in which CNN\'s\xa0John Zarella\xa0and\xa0Broward County, Florida\xa0Sheriff\xa0Ken Jennedemonstrated the rapid firing of\xa0fully automatic\xa0firearms while covering the federal\xa0Assault Weapons Ban, due to expire the following year. The Assault Weapons Ban was concerned solely with\xa0semi-automatic firearms, not fully automatic ones, which had already been restricted by the\xa0National Firearms Act\xa0of 1934, and the subsequent 1986\xa0Firearm Owners Protection Act.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'

'Also, some defendants get very anxious or are terrible at speaking, which could be misconstrued as indicatin guilt by a jury. The 5th keeps that from happening as even the most innocent of people can get nervous or jumpy when being grilled by an experienced prosecutor.'
"That's a Miranda warning, based on the 5th Amendment but it's not the 5th Amendment. If you're being arrested then you're already on the criminal side of things, not civil.\n\nThe actual 5th Amendment is pretty clear:\n\n> No person... shall be compelled **in any criminal case** to be a witness against himself"
"IANAL, but I don't think the 5th applies to only to criminal charges or even pending charges.  You can plead the fifth to civil charges as well.  And it has nothing to do with whether charges are pending or not... say you're called to testify in a trial, and you're not the defendant.

'People have said to me, ‘Stephen you gotta understand, you don’t even know your history. You’re dumb. You’re dense. You’re a mental midget with the IQ of a butter dish whose mind is a black hole that sucks all surrounding thought into it in an infinite singularity of pure stupidity. Stephen I’m surprised you can even dress yourself. I bet you have to rub peanut butter inside your lips to remember to open your mouth to breathe. I have never met, and I hope to never meet again, a man so pervasively astoundingly unyieldingly ignorant.’ To which I say, \'well then you haven’t met Louie Gohmert.\'\n—Stephen Colbert\n\nLouis Buller "Louie" Gohmert, Jr. (born 1953) is a Republican Representative from Texas (first elected in 2004) and an accomplished idiot'
'I won’t abandon trying to get their opponents elected quite that quickly. Morons. BRB, looking up their re-election dates... '
'They had a whip count of this a long time ago. If they ever actually brought it to a vote it would fail embarrassingly just because Republicans do not want to be on the record about this. On top of that the senate hearings would be an absolute shit show.\n\nThis is:\n\n- More mudslinging on the investigation and eventual impeachment hearings.\n- Paving the road for Trump to unilaterally shut down the investigation.\n- A quick talking point for easy victory in 70% red districts (though they are kinda fucking their more vulnerable Republican colleagues).'
'Desperate Gym Jordan trying to deflect from his own scandal, with the help of aborter douchebag Scott Desjarlais giving him a douchey hand, anyone? These fuckers are rotten to the core. Unbelievable.'
'But alas, it was seen as a joke, so in the future when the orange idiot pressures the repuke leadership to try again, it will be seen as another silly attempt and a joke.'
'The lawsuit regarding his violation of the Emoluments Clause is going to enter the discovery phase fairly soon, part of discovery will be his personal finances and the Trump organization finances.'
'They made this carefully crafted turd, hyped everyone up about whether or not and then when they would throw it. Then they throw it at the wall as hard as they could. They see it hit the wall, and then watch, disappointed, as it peels off the wall and plops flat onto the floor. \n\nAnd then they look up at everyone else who are bewildered at what the fuck just happened, and then they look down at their shit-stained hands, and finally head to the restroom to wash it off.'
"There's a huge issue with FISA courts in that they'll issue pretty much a warrant at request (something like over 95% of FISA warrants are approved when requested), however, this isn't an issue with bias or partisanship, but rather the FISA court system.  What Republicans CAN'T do is support this system for a good decade and a half, keep renewing the PATRIOT Act over and over, which has enabled these courts to behave in this manner, and then cry foul when one of their own becomes a surveillance target due to his illegal ties (ie Carter Page).\n\nThe Fast and Furious issue was with the ATF, which is a completely different department than anything that has to do with this, so what do I think?  I think your friend is a retard. "
"They aren't really smart enough to understand this memo is shit. Faux keeps saying it vindicates trump so his base thinks it does. They don't have enough brains to read or watch anything else that tells the truth. I feel bad for them actually."
'What the fucking hell'
'Also, what the fuck is the NY Times doing? CNN? Why is a random lawyer from Los Angeles or something getting a major scoop?'
'Thee are strict rules on foreign involvement in domestic campaign including contributions to campaigns. Laundering the money through an attorney, if proven, is a serious breach and not just a fine but jail time.. And its not just one instance, after receiving the money, if it\'s deemed an illegal contribution every instance he uses the illegal money, is a separate violation. While in most cases, sentences are usually concurrent, but egregious violations can be stacked, which means it could be 10+ years of "tape my butt shut" Federal Prison'
"Trump fucked a lot of women. Many of  whom sought to have their sordid stories made public after Donnie Moscow won the GOP nomination, likely for the money they'd get from the tabloids and the like.  Stormy Daniels is one such woman. To prevent these stories from coming out, Donnie instructed his personal attorney to pay them hush money and sign NDAs to enforce their silence in the months before the election in 2016. That attorney was Cohen. But Donnie Moscow doesn't have much cash lying around, because he's massively in debt to a number of foreign investors (aka leveraged). These investors are mostly Russian oligarchs. So when it comes time to pay that hush money, Donnie has to ask his investors for a little more cash. Cohen goes to Prague to talk to the oligarchs and makes the ask. They comply, and Cohen gets the money. Cohen pays the women. \n\nTLDR; Donnie Moscow used Russian money to pay off porn stars he fucked while the first lady was pregnant with Baron Trump. Yup, it's that salacious. "
'They both suck. \n\nThis election cycle was a bad one. '
'That\'s whats been said, but new information contradicts that. (Trump paying Cohen back)  The violations accrue to Cohen, every time he uses that "tainted money" so if he made payments to Stormy Daniels using that money, its a violation, but also a violation every time he paid out money, that can be established coming from those funds, to pay for things were campaign related or otherwise restricted from doing so.'
'Been watching bum shock fights recently?'
"You're absolutely right.  I'd rather not jam either in my mouth, but it's real obvious which will burn me more / do more lasting damage to the laws and norms that make America a functional democracy."
"TBH I don't really give even half a shit about his extramarital affairs. I'm MUCH more interested in two things: \n\n1)  The palpable hypocricy that he bought and sold numerous properties from forclosed HUD real estate which was insured with loans from the National Housing Act, one of the very policies that Hannity was highly critical of in the obama adminisration\n\n2) the shady way he hid it in over 20 shell companies and how he teamed up with Jeff Brock, who plead guilty and was convicted in 2016 for federal charges of bank fraud and conspiracy in his role in an operation to rig foreclosure auctions between 2007 and 2012. Some of the houses sold on to the Hannity-linked firm in 2012 had been acquired by Brock from banks later named by prosecutors among his victims. But the justice department declined to identify specific properties sold in the rigged auctions\n\nThis might end with handcuffs. "
"Since he didn't get caught up in the Fox harassment scandals, I think this is unlikely.\n\nHannity was an informal advisor to DJT's campaign. He has been attacking Mueller longer than any of his fellow Fox anchors. \n\nI think there's a good chance his conversations with Cohen related to collusion."
"I'm not at all sure I'd say he's more honest than Trump, if for no other reason than the fact that he's used his bully pulpit to spread lies for a couple decades now. Trump has had the pulpit for a much shorter timeframe. \n\nThey're both despicable liars. Both have built their careers on the backs of their lies, but Hannity's lies have infected political discourse in this country to the extent that we now have Trump in office. If Hannity and his ilk didn't have a pulpit, neither would Trump. "
"> Since he didn't get caught up in the Fox harassment scandals\n\nI guarantee you he took part in constructing the scandal though so he could usurp O'Reilly's position. I'm not saying the sexual harrassment didn't happen, i'm just saying he knew about it and let it blow up so he could take O'Reilly's job. "
"Oh believe me I'm not giving Hannity slack but he got in front of confessing he's a horrible person to the public.  Given the extent of Cohen's services to his two other clients, we may find a mistress but realistically he's gave up some information."
"I agree but I'm confident he'll follow the law and report it in closed door meetings with Congress at which point the Democrats in the room will promptly leak it unless it's classified material to pay the scumbag Republicans back for leaking that bullshit about Anthony Weiner's laptop in the days before the election."
'If he doesn’t continue lying to his base, they might look for the truth on their own and then abandon him.'
"And they won't believe it when this all comes to a head. They will screech about fake news and liberal tears and continue to live in their own little alternate reality while the country begins to heal."
'They\'re not siding with him over football though; they\'re siding with him over *"disrespectful n#$$¢&s."*  Yeah, they\'re a braindead diehard bunch of mouth breathers, but their NASCAR, their rasslin\', their cartoons, their tendie dip - that shit is sacred to them.  Trump\'s stupid bubble of support is getting smaller every day and it will eventually be popped by something stupid Trump says.  And the rest of us will be facepalming, going *"REALLY??  RANCH?!  THAT\'S YOUR LINE???!  FUCKING MORONS!"* '
'Well from my understanding Nixon wasn’t a bad president (not the greatest but not that bad either) and of watergate didn’t happen he probably would have been re-elected. But I wasn’t born then so idk'
'It appears that his base consists of lower class poor whites (typically rednecks) and it also consists of “edgy” young white males. \n\nThe neckbeards see trump as a way of retaking their male power or some bullshit. I think these people are referred to as “redpillers” or something. They are sort of similar to the incells but they may have gotten laid a few times. \n\n\nActually I don’t know how to really explain it any simpler than people that want to be racist, sexist, etc view trump highly. '
'If a conspiracy theorist thinks you have a bad case then something is wrong. Those guys will jump on any bandwagon to beat on the government or system just to prove a point.'
'The sad thing is that your probably accurate. I would assume that the majority of high level republicans and conservatives know that Fox News just spews bullshit to further their agenda. However Trump actually believes what’s being said on Fox News. '
'More and more people are totally fine with Trump doing whatever he pleases. I miss the days when it was just the stereotypical moonshine smuggling, beer can shooting rednecks that were racist enough to vote against their own interests.'
"See, the Right likes to bring up the founding fathers all the time, but this is what the founding fathers were ACTUALLY worried about: they were worried about a king who had enough power to bully the citizens and bankrupt the country with no one who could make him stop. Back in those days, it wasn't the constitutional monarchy like England has now. It was a king who was very powerful and a parliament who had some power, but still had to bow to the king's will in many different matters. He was no simple figurehead. \n\nIf Trump does fire Mueller, we must impeach because Trump will be acting as if he's a king. Not just because what he's doing is illegal, but because the thing he's doing is illegal *because absolute monarchy is illegal*. "
'I think often over the dumb patriot movement that was justified by crazy right wing conspiracies over Obama FEMA death camps, Obama turning the police into a military to declare martial law etc. This lead to to a whole demographic fantasizing over this idea of being the next "patriots" to take up arms against a "tyrannical" government. Spending their retirement, and creating debt to invest in prepping for a walking dead scenario (without Zombies) and a civil war. These people want a civil war. They may or may not act on it, but deep down inside, they are yearning for someone to get the ball rolling so they can live out these fantasies. It is disturbing, to say the least. '
"People are numb. His  normalization is the most terrifying thing. If we were in a recession it would be a different situation entirely. I'm wondering if the GOP will sacrifice him after the tax bill passes or will they realize that total noise works for the short term. "
'> moonshine smuggling, beer can shooting rednecks that were racist enough to vote against their own interests.\n\nahhh there it is. '
"You and I both know you're not capable of that.  Why don't you head on back to t_D before you trip over a noun and hurt yourself."
'I’m not falling for your troll bait, but when when his “lawyer” who just be a complete retard, tweets about collusion, there just might be collusion. \n\nYou guys can play all these mental mind games and incriminate Hillary with uranium, but can’t see the obvious connections between Trump and Russia. Not only is that the most dangerous mistake ever to be made, idk you’re prolly too young to remember the Cold War, but you have to be pretty damn ignorant to everything that’s going on. \n\nI won’t respond past this message, go back to your eco chamber in T_D'
'Yep, Identity politics are cancer on all sides. '
'>"In the interests of preserving our election integrity, we are forced to suspend elections due to foreign interference."\n\nBecause all elections are managed at the state level, and so this would be a Tenth Amendment violation, and in doing so it would raise all kinds of alarms in multiple state governments, multiplying (from the GOP\'s and GRU\'s perspective) the amount of scrutiny on them.\n\nOf course, none of this is relevant to the Mueller investigation since the indictment makes it evident that even the 2016 interference was being monitored in realtime.\n\nAlso, with as many state elections that are going to be closer, GRU would have to expose themselves to detection at many points of ingress.  NSA and Cyber Command are running a counter-intelligence op without direction from Trump, per the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-and-cyber-command-to-coordinate-actions-to-counter-russian-election-interference-in-2018-amid-absence-of-white-house-guidance/2018/07/17/baac95b2-8900-11e8-85ae-511bc1146b0b_story.html?utm_term=.2df907b18ed0).'
'>"When you have a president lying about abuse of power **such as lying about asking Michael Flynn not to be prosecuted**, in that case, **I believe James Comey and not Mr. Trump**, that type of lie is an abuse of power and could be an impeachable offense." \n\nAt what point is Cohen no longer begging for a pardon?  Because this new lawyer seems to have it out for the shit gibbon.'
'I see no reason at all why he wouldn’t. He was Trump’s loyal minion for YEARS. Did all his dirty work did a good job of it for the most part.\n\nAnd the second his office is raided by the FBI, Trump makes him out to be a coffee boy that he barely knows, on top of shit talking him for being a criminal. Trump is doing bothing at all to insure Cohen’s silence. Maybe Cohen actually doesn’t know anything. If he did I feel like Trump would be throwing money at Cohen to keep him quiet and defending him publically. But Trump *is* a fucking halfwit so who knows what the hell he’s doing. '
"That's what it seemed before, but this isn't really flexing any muscle.  His lawyer's not threatening any over possibilities.  He's just talking shit about Trump in public.\n\nUnless... (tinfoil hat) That private conversation between Comey and Trump about Flynn had some less-than-private component that connected Cohen somehow... but I'd give that a massive grain of salt because it seems odd to have a lawyer sending this kind of message, let alone sending it in such an antagonistic manner."
"Cohen got stabbed in the back and this is his only option. He's an employee of djt. He worked for him for so long he was mistaken to think he was somewhat special."
"But Faux News is telling people every day how corrupt the DOJ and FBI are.  I see my old relatives posting this shit to Facebook now.  The longer this takes, the more entrenched the base is to not believe anything that comes up.  I'm really concerned how this is gonna go down.  I'm equally concerned that it won't go down at all.  "
'We seem to have all the story we need and it comes from trump’s crappy attorney.   He wrote letters to leadership of a couple congressional committee’s.  \n\n(Not an Attorney) If his complaint had merit he would have went to the same federal Judge who has issued subpoenas and indictments asking for an injunction.  \n\nHe wrote a letter just to get Fox News to work their propaganda.  Nothing more.   Fox News is he “secret” propaganda department for the trump/Russia/gop  regime.  '
'But there was a verbal agreement not to share them by a (now) dead guy! With no paper trail whatsoever! Such illegal!'
'My recollection is that pre Iraq the attitude towards the IC was FBI=Good, CIA=Bad, WTF is NSA?'
"There's no way they'd be saying this if Cohen hadn't flipped/was very close to finalizing a plea deal. He's become the enemy (to them)."
'"Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, Michael Cohen cannot be trusted.\n\nI mean c\'mon, he worked for Donald J Trump for decades, so of course, he is a lying piece of shit! \n\nTherefore, you cannot believe any of his testimony, and you must take take the word of my client, Donald J Trump!"\n\n-Rudy G'
"This is a common strategy when attacking witnesses who've flipped. The issue for Trump is that for many of these potential crimes the prosecution won't only be relying on Cohen's statements to make its case. There will be other testimony and documentary evidence supporting these charges. It's possible Cohen will only be providing context and background. In other words if the prosecution is doing its job and the evidence is strong (and most of us think it is) this shouldn't turn into a he said/she said."
'Does lying about a liar make you a liar?'
"I don't understand this argument that Cohen is a pathological liar. That sort of implies he's been lying on Trump's behalf for years."
'What happened to shame? Is it dead? '
'why whine and complain if there’s nothing to be found?'

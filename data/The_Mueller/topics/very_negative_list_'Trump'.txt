Trump says if you oppose him, that means you want to go to war -- endless troll accounts are chirping the same nonsense -- so I just wanted to note that this is a common form of Russian propaganda.
12 Russian intelligence agents were just charged with attacking the US, Trump directly encouraged that attack, Trump directly benefitted from that attack. And Trump just blamed it all on us, on his way to a private meeting with Putin. This is the Republican party. They hate America.
Fox News MUST respond: "Who at Fox News knew that Sean Hannity had a secret relationship with Trump lawyer Michael Cohen?" If the answer is "nobody" then Hannity should be fired. Any other answer may indicate conspiracy.
Trump's latest whine -- "why didn't the FBI warn me Russians might try to infiltrate my campaign!?!" -- which totally makes sense, if you ignore that the FBI warned Trump that Russians might try to infiltrate his campaign.
In The Beginning, there was: "We never had any contacts with Russians, period!" When caught, Trump lied: "it was only about adoptions!" Caught again, it became: "but we didn't get anything!" Now they have stooped to: "Hey! Look! Over there! A taxi!" The GOP is trying to steal our whole country.
Friday Giuliani: "Trump intervened in the Time Warner-AT&T merger!" -- Saturday Giuliani: "Trump didn't intervene in the Time Warner-AT&T merger!" -- and 35% still believe these non-stop liars.
Here's a reminder that President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein were accused of violently raping a 13-year-old girl at an orgy in the 90s. She had to eventually drop the lawsuit due to fear for her life.
While Republicans act all outraged over the White House Correspondents Dinner, let's remember when Trump repeatedly defended himself from sexual assault claims by saying the women were too ugly for his taste to assault.

Trump to use manipulation of American public to sow distrust of investigation leading up to criminal trials. This is coming from the WH.
Trump: Threatens Russia with missiles, then blames Mueller for "Bad Blood" with Russia two hours later....
Reminder: Trump himself used Russian Active Measures, quoting lies from Russian propaganda site Sputnik, to attack Hillary Clinton in a major campaign speech in October 2016, during the attack on American democracy.
Gary Cohn, Trump’s top economic adviser, resigns. In related news, Trump a little earlier today: "The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! There is no Chaos, only great Energy!"
Trump saw evidence that Putin personally ordered the attack on US elections even BEFORE he was inaugurated. He knew each time he tried to deflect blame away from them. He knew when he invited Lavrov to the Oval Office. He knew when he fired Comey. He fucking knew.
New leak shows how Russia's Internet Research Agency operated on Reddit, organized rallies now including in Georgia and New York -- and the Georgia rally escalated into violence. But Trump still pretends nothing happened, and the Republican party won't do anything to stop the ongoing attack.
So Trump just confessed that he knew Flynn lied to the FBI when he fired Comey in order to stop the investigation.
If Trump Fires Mueller, We Must Impeach: The country will find itself in a constitutional crisis, where the executive branch rejects checks and balances and the rule of law

">Another was Natalia Veselnitskaya , the Russian lawyer whose June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with Donald Trump Jr. has become a focus of the Russia investigation. She attended a black-tie inaugural party hosted by the campaign committee of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), according to an associate who accompanied her\n\n>In a statement, Veselnitskaya told The Post that she attended a private event in Washington that night at Akhmetshin’s invitation. She added that she did not go to the inauguration and was in the area because she was meeting the next day with an American woman frustrated by the Russian ban on adoptions by U.S. citizens.\n\n>Michael Tremonte, a lawyer for Akhmetshin, said his client recalls that he was given tickets by a person involved in organizing the event and that he invited Veselnitskaya to join him because he knew she was in town. Tremonte said Akhmetshin did not attend any official inaugural events.\n\n>Kenneth Grubbs, a spokesman for Rohrabacher’s congressional office, said the campaign has no record of Akhmetshin’s invitation to the party or of tickets purchased by him or Veselnitskaya.\n\nAs a reminder, Akhmetshin is the one who was with Veselnitskaya at the famous Trump Tower meeting with Don junior, kushner and manafort.\n\nSomehow I'm not surprised the two of them made an appearance at these events at Rohrabacher’s invitation and that Rohrabacher’s office doesn't seem to have any recollection of inviting them. It's so strange that his name keeps popping up and that he has the same kind of bad memory as everyone else who interacts with Russians. Maybe the real story here is that there is an outbreak of amnesia brought upon by contact with Russians. Probably the Clinton's and the other lizard people running the world who are deliberately doing this to frame these innocent patriots in an effort to sabotage Trump and subvert democracy. "

"I'm aware of all the theories why he's stepping down now but I'd like to throw this out there. IF a case against Donald makes it to the Supreme Court, i.e. He's a retard, then this guy would have to recuse himself because of the obvious connection to his son. He wants to avoid that mess so he's getting the hell out of dodge. To me this means either we can expect a constitutional crisis with a Trump stacked Supreme Court, or this guy is just old and its all a coincidence. "
"Kennedy's wife has been sick for awhile and he is taking care of her, and for an 80-year-old man/Supreme Court Justice that's a lot of work.   \nI don't like Trump, I don't like the GOP, and I don't like Kennedy's retirement but I'm not ready to jump on the conspiracy train yet. "
"Conspiracy theories don't care about facts."
"The theory goes Kennedy isn't stepping down because he wants to.  He is likely being forced to.  Kennedy's son is in financially in bed with trump and Russians for >10M(he gave trump 10M in Russian backed loans).  So Kennedy gets a call from someone, resign now or your son never comes home, oh and don't sound the alarm on this deal.\n\nThus Russians threatening Kennedy via his son, force him to give their mole trump a swing vote in the SCOTUS. \n\nOh and admitting anything about this threat would link his son in the trump scandal."
"deutsche bank has been under investigation for money laundering (russian money laundering) for quite some time now, the likely hood that this guys son wasn't complicit is incredibly low.\n\nand whether or not justice kennedy had any knowledge or involvement of/in the process, it's going to look really bad for him either way."
'Agreed.  What’s the connection?  Loans?  Really?  Quit being outraged at everything and focus.  '
'Because now is when they can get a young hardline right wing judge in there. If they wait and lose their majority in the senate, then the Dems will likely block any appointment like McConnell did.\n\nWhy would they risk that? '

Had they got rid of Trump before then and you had a President Pence, some might think the main work of getting rid of Trump was done and so wouldn't bother voting in 2018 and you'd end up with a GOP still controlling the house and senate but with a President Pence instead which is just as bad if not worse from a policy standpoint, just not as entertaining as the Clusterfuck that is Trump...oh and the threat off accidentally starting WW3 would have receded I suppose.\n\nHe's absolutely screwed after the elections.

I want to solve North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, terrorism, and Russia can greatly help!\n\nIn a sense, he's not wrong.  Russia is making North Korea worse by probably providing them with rocket technology to threaten not only all of Japan, but the US also.  Russia is Assad's real ally because Russia cares about nothing but their naval base on the Med.  Russia is 95% of the problem in Ukraine between their theft of Crimea, military invasion of the east and driving crime and corruption in the nation.  As for terrorism, given Russia's drive to cause chaos and disruption among the democratic parts of the world, this would seem to be an admission by Trump that Russia is a key driver of the violence and attacks that kill so many innocent people, including many Americans.\n\nSooo... it sounds like a good rundown of why Russia (not the people, but the criminal operation that controls the country) is such a major problem around the world and for the US.\n\nBut Trump's response is to lick Putin's... er... boots.\n\nWeak.

"As stoked as I am to read this, I doubt it. I hope I am wrong. However, as I've read elsewhere, Trump likely has to be impeached *before* he can legally be indicted by the special counsel. \n\nSo as much as it would be nice to see this blown wide open, if I were Mueller, I would likely be waiting until after the midterm elections when the odds of impeachment go way up. Otherwise you risk not being able to successfully indict him with criminal offenses. Again, I hope I'm wrong, but if I'm not that means it won't be until late 2018 or early 2019 before we really see things really fire up. "

"As Carter Page is in the news. I want to point eyes to another name that was in trump and russia's orbit at the time, Sam Clovis. \n\nCarter Page.

Page is the dude where you'll hear about the company, Rosneft. Carter Page has no relation to Lisa Page. \n\nBasically the russians thought Carter Page to be a useful idiot they've had contact with for a long time. \n>4/8/13 Court documents show that one of the Russian intelligence operatives attempting to recruit Page thinks he is “an idiot” who wants to “rise up” and “earn lots of money.” [Source](https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/PodobnyyComplaint-2.pdf). \n\nThe trump campaign let him in as an unpaid walk on because ? (I guess working with the russians and told too, duh). \n>Carter Page becomes an unpaid volunteer for an informal foreign policy committee that candidate Trump is forming. When later describing his work experience, Page says he had helped open the Moscow office of investment banking firm Merrill Lynch and had advised Russian majority state-owned energy giant Gazprom, in which he is an investor. Page notes that his stock portfolio has suffered since the US and Europe imposed sanctions on Russia in 2014.

Oct 21, 2016 the FISA warrant on Carter Page in relation to the trump campaign and russia was issued. \n\nThat warrant was renewed 3 times and signatories to the application include FBI Director James Comey, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

Trump was trying to say Page was an FBI informant the whole time and because 2 FBI agents may have saw what the russians were doing as problematic, Page was somehow planting all this evidence as a plant. Now they are saying Peter Strozk lied in the FISA warrant to get it approved. Ignoring any proof of what that lie was and ignoring that the Chief of the Counterespionage Section of the FBI might have a first name relationship with everyone in his field.

'Impeach him? Trump needs to sit the rest of his years in pound you in the ass prison for selling our country out alone, not to mention his trail of other misdeeds. Trump needs to be held accountable for once.'
'Carter Page has not been charged with a crime, named himself a spy, nor been named a spy by the DOJ. Maybe he will someday, but you should annotate accusations vs facts. Otherwise you’re spreading misinformation akin to practices within the GOP.'
'No they were contacted by spies and broke rules they never knew existed, at least be accurate '
"Threatening war is my biggest concern right now. When Mueller releases the damning evidence, or right before it, Trump is going to declare war. Maybe he'll find a reason to convince his base, maybe he'll launch secret ops or hired teams to engineer an attack from one of our foes in the middle east; but one way or another he's going to start a war since it's historically the best way to hold onto power."
'Several members of the Trump campaign and administration, from George Papadopoulos to Michael Flynn, have plead guilty to charges that suggest collusion. Everything from lying about contact with Russia during the campaign to conspiracy to defraud the United States. \n\n\nI’m not saying Clinton is squeaky clean. I’m saying if you were alarmed by alleged Clinton corruption, you should be alarmed by this. '
"Somehow other adminstrations avoided this problem. It's possible to learn rules in lower level jobs and then be selected for a high level job because your experience makes you better than candidates who don't know the rules. Crazy idea, right?"
"So you're accepting that at the very least, the whole Trump team is incredibly incompetent. And being realistic, they're a bunch of TRE45ONOUS bastards. "
"> No they were contacted by spies and broke rules they never knew existed, at least be accurate \n\nthat's not at all accurate. why are you spreading misinformation?\n\n"
'People keep criticizing them for just talking and not acting, but I think that ignores the importance of talking for politicians. They can\'t just come out and say "Trump should be impeached," because Fox News won\'t mention it. \n\n\nWhat they have to do is slowly build up with slighter criticisms. By doing it that way Fox News doesn\'t realize what they\'re doing, and they\'re able to get their message to the voters. Eventually other Republicans join them and slowly but surely the Fox News demographic changes their minds. Then the ones defending Trump look crazy and lose their power.\n\n\nRight now if they came out and said "Impeach Trump!" they would be out of office by the time impeachment proceedings began. This way is slower, but long term less likely to end in a civil war or with assassination attempts.'
'Talk is cheap. No Republican in Congress has called for the impeachment of trump. in comparison to the Nixon timeline, there were some Republicans in Congress who were clamoring for his impeachment after the Saturday Night Massacre.\n\nWhatever Putin has on the GOP, it is enough to end the party permanently. None of those "trump isn\'t good for us!" shitholes do anything actionable, they still vote with the party, they still support the heinous policies his adminstration puts out. The only reason why they say that shit is to convince people like you that they aren\'t partisan hacks and hopefully get some moderates to vote for them in their mid term elections.\n\nThere is a lucrative business in being an elected conservative in America. If the GOP goes down, then so does the bulk of a market that allied itself with them. Energy, automotives, manufacturing, land & air freight, technology, agriculture, banks, healthcare...it would destroy their credibility and confidence on the global market and probably lead to a recession worse than the one in the 30\'s. Of course to the dumbass GOP, what they dont realize is it is not a matter of \'if\' Putin will release that bomb, but \'when.\' Putin\'s goal has, and always will be, the destruction of America. Just because he helped install a puppet doesnt mean he wont cut the strings when it suits his own interests.'
"Dude I don't understand either. I just keep telling myself that if propaganda didn't work it wouldn't be used.. I'm trying to be inclusive and promote American unity while informing.. I work with a bunch of Republicans and every conversation gets heated so I think I give up on them. It's literally, look at this well sourced information - I'm not reading anything! Or they respond with the latest fox topic or some real crazy shit they got from the internet. And tell me that I can't believe everything on the internet..... I'm the one saying there is a cold war of disinformation being waged do you really think I'm not trying to be careful with my sources?\n\nIt's bad here. Makes me feel crazy sometimes having everyone against me lol "
'Papadopoulos pled guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia. He’s now cooperating with the investigation. If he hadn’t agreed to cooperate, I don’t know what his charges would’ve been.\n\nPaul Manafort, who is not on OP’s list, is standing trial for conspiracy against the United States among many other charges.

Otherwise, basically the same!'
'The democrats are no saints, no argument there. But what republicans are doing is much worse at the moment.'
"I seriously do not fucking understand how the right has coalesced around Trump even when so many voices amongst their own cry out for reason. \n\nLike, if Trump had been some sort of Bernie Sanders style figure who was championing right-wing policies for the last 30 years and suddenly the party turned on him, okay, but this is a moron who popped up into the party two years ago mostly thanks to being a birther. He wasn't even a Republican years ago. \n\nYet, for some reason, even as the National Review and other conservative journalists, and even present and former Republican politicians, come out against this guy, *they* get thrown aside and attacked. \n\nIt's like watching everyone at a family reunion suddenly embracing a cousin's drunk-ass new boyfriend and telling anyone who criticizes him to go the fuck home. "
'Yeah. Here is the thing. I fucking hate Trump and everything he is and stands for but this story is a nothingburger of a story. SHAMEFUL from what used to be a reputable journal "the Hill"'
'The voices crying out for reason are the core GOP,  or "real Republicans".   \n\nThe people supporting Trump are the crazy people the GOP co-opted during the 1970s (when Nixon brought racists into the fold) and the 1980s (when Regan brought religious nuts in the fold).  \n\nThe Democrats had been in power since the New Deal.  Then the the GOP united the Three R\'s (**R**ich people,  **R**acists,  and **R**eligious nuts) under the Republican\'s anti-big-government banner and had a good few decades from the 1980s through the 2000s.\n\nBut an entire generation of right wing crazy people grew up supported by an establishment that told them their crazy ideas were legitimate.  And like Frakenstein\'s monster they broke free of their masters,  and are lurching half-aware through the public discourse with no clear idea of what is going on.\n\nThe GOP doesn\'t feel that they can tell the crazy people how crazy they and maintain a hold on power.  They are broken.  If Trump hadn\'t won the Republican Primary,  it would have gone to Ted Cruz.  Consider the significance of that.  Trump didn\'t hijack the Republican Primary from the GOP.  He hijacked it from *Ted Cruz*,  who himself hijacked it from the GOP.   That\'s how broken the GOP is.'
"[Even Dick fucking Cheney came out to condemn Trump's plan to ban Muslims.](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/remember-dick-cheneys-words-on-muslim-ban/article/2613309) "
'Yeah, even if Trump could be bothered to understand what this means, what are the chances he has the discipline or the disposition to follow the advice?\n\nTrump\'s the kind of idiot to hear this and decide "Fuck it, I\'m untouchable" and double down on his moronic behavior.'

"No, Republicans are giving us too little credit.  Read the indictment, it is worth the time.  Republicans are in this to the hilt.

"No, they don't think the Mueller investigation is a witch hunt. They think people like you and the media are conducting a which hunt. Difference is Mueller is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. Media and people seemingly like you only care about digging up any shit on Trump possible (piss dossier, racist property deals, stormy Daniel's, grab em by the pussy, etc) that's a witch hunt. You are looking for a witch and you won't rest till you find one. Muellers investigation isn't that."
'This is what really matters, Republicans couldn’t care less about Russia and the treason of the GOP (even though they were willing to believe every lie about Obama’s...)\n\nWe need to remind Wisconsin about Walker’s shitty policies, about how Republicans hurt the public school system there, and how they destroyed the unions while giving rich people tax cuts which destroyed the State’s economy.'
"Spy? Who said spy? What possible information could she get that the KGB couldn't!? She wasn't there for that, because Russia know how they can bring down the US already. They're nearly finished. She is an undocumented agent of a foreign adversary operating on US soil. I.e. more dodgy (untraceable) diplomat than spy. If she was a diplomat, she would have been expelled. She doesn't have that protection, so will undoubtedly go to jail. It's not the same crime as espionage, but what she was up to is no less damaging to the US. "
'Um, no. People do indeed give a fuck about Russian interference in our elections.'
"You're right it is worse than Joe McCarthy, because the current GOP are absolutely traitors to America, and the evidence is abundant. What's really the worst is that the right-wing base doesn't care if the representatives they elected sell out America to Putin, and that's really sad."
"It's so creepy that you don't care that we've been and currently are under attack from Russia. You're so worried it might cause a hiccup in your ability to kiss up to trump that you're willing to let our nation go undefended against attack. That's so submissive it's disgusting. Have some decency."

"Trump is a living representation of legal abuse and, frankly, the american bar association bloody hates the fucking guy. at this point, the only reason anyone would represent him is because you support him. Unfortunately, this leads to his other problem. He needs a lawyer that isn't horseshit and doesn't rely on money from Fox TV punditry. What Trump *really* needs is a lawyer with a superpower that will convince him to shut the fuck up so he can get a decent plea deal. What Trump *thinks* he needs is a television attack dog. He's just behaving... so. fucking. stupidly. They say that when we get stressed or angry it can reduce your capacity to think critically. We have never seen someone so inept at the basic adult skill of calming down in the oval before."

"I don't see any reason Team-Trump would leak this list.  The list, like the Comey memos, makes Trump look best-case suspicious and worst-case guilty.  Either we have a rogue operative on Team Trump or team Mueller wanted this leaked.  Personally, I think Mueller had this list leaked via a third party proxy.  He wants the public to know exactly what his questions are.  It gives everyone more than a hint as to what's on the S.C.'s mind and what they're working on."
"This smells of a Giuliani leak.  He's trying to sabotage the investigation."
'The Hill is reporting that Trump leaked the questions, as evidenced by grammatical errors, then tweeted that it is a disgrace someone leaked them.  #wagthedog'
'My money is on Trump refusing to answer any of these questions and just calling them stupid, in the same way that he used to conduct press conferences. '
"It doesn't even matter he's just gonna fucking lie through his teeth and the right will defend him till death. Nothing that Mueller does will have an effect on trump's presidency. "
"Trump aced this test already. He leaks the questions so that anyone else involved knows he they need to contact him so they keep their lies straight, or so that they know he is about to out them.\nHe leaked then to the NYT, a media giant that Trump has criticized.\nAnd then goes to twitter saying Muller's team leaked the witch hunt documents to biased media.\n\nSay what you want about Trump, but that right there, is the art of the deal. His supporters will cling to the fact that the crooked (Hillary) and FBI leak the documents and assume the FBI has no credibility. Also, I feel like he is setting the stage by calling the FBI liars, so that when he lies under oath, he can complain that everyone is lying. Then that he didn't lie, but *they* did. Then, even if Trump did lie, he didn't understand the question so it wasn't a true lie. Then, Hillary lied about her email server, what about Hillary? Then, more excuses and misdirects."
'I like how everyone is already over the Fox and Friends rant. We’re actually at a point where our sitting president can go on a public rant where he...\n\n— Tells many lies about factual things\n\n— Contradicts himself numerous times\n\n— Contradicts earlier statements even more\n\n— Talks in circles\n\n— Repeats himself\n\n— Incriminates himself several times\n\n— Refuses to shut up and essentially has to be forced off the air\n\n... and we’re not surprised. It wasn’t even the top story that day. I’m flabbergasted that all of this is now normal.'
'It\'s actually quite likely that Trump himself (or Trump\'s aides) created and "leaked" said list. Deliberately.\n\nGrammatical errors, horrific prose; it\'s entirely off-handed garbage, not the legal writings of a senior federal agent.'
'Mueller already knows the answer to all these questions... 😎Trump is fucked '
'His work is done. Retracting or correcting his bullshit just makes him look weak. All he has to do now is stand by in silence until the cultists start saying, "Are you still talking about that? It\'s old news. WhataboutObamaClintonBenghaziEmailsThough!?!?"'
'The silence from that little whiner speaks volumes. He must be so unbelievably fucked. '
'Nunes has to know hes manafucked when the shoe drops. There is no other reason for this dude putting his neck is so much danger. '
'This was never meant to be a real accusation. Everybody who\'s plugged in, especially Nunes, knows that there was never any basis to this claim.\n\nThe entire strategy here is to insert the idea that there are "two sides" to this. They\'re hoping that just throwing enough vaguely bad-sounding stuff out about this investigation will destroy its legitimacy. Even if a given claim is disproven, the fact that people on TV were even discussing it can be seen as a victory.\n\nEvery goddamn day we weaken the pillars of our democracy a little more.'
'Nunes is waist deep in this shit. He’s trying to cover for his own corruption.'
'Confused here. \n\nThey said there was NOT a spy, Gowdy said the FBI did insert a spy in the campaign just not directed towards Trump. CNN then uses his words to say there was no spy.\n\nSo are you agreeing with Gowdy, saying there was a spy used correctly? Or are you disagreeing with Gowdy and saying there was no spy?'
'They are all full of shit and you know it. I just wished reddit would stop pretending. Impeach, don’t impeach. The status quo won’t change.'
' lol my coworker is a fucking retard who kept saying “WHAT ABOUT BENGHAZI?” Then when I asked him “what about it” he stuttered and had nothing to say except “there was a cover up” lol these people are insane. He goes on to say “just because there are guilty pleas doesn’t mean there was collusion” I continue to tell him that the fbi and cia have confirmed there was collusion so he says yea but Trump didn’t collude his campaign did. I kept thinking like this guy’s a retard. '
"Filet Mignon and Doritos doesn't actually sound like that bad of a meal.\n\nGod, I'm turning orange..."
"The FBI asked an informant to talk to a couple of shady characters who were on the president's campaign staff and see if the evidence of Russian interference checked out. That's not spying, that's investigating crimes. See the difference? If it helps you remember, three campaign staffers have been convicted of felonies and a fourth faces multiple felony indictments. You know, crimes. "
"Yeah, it's so weird that a law enforcement agency didn't want to turn over evidence from an ongoing criminal investigation. They usually love to do that.\n\nOh wait, no they fucking don't. Nunes' actions have been unprecedented and quite possibly criminal, not to mention a clear violation of his oath of office. He's using the power entrusted to him by the people to undermine public confidence in the FBI through half-truths and outright lies - not out of any desire to provide the oversight that is his job, but out of a desperate attempt to forestall a legitimate investigation. \n\nCrazy that the FBI didn't want to help him spread disinformation and otherwise frustrate their investigation, though."
'Because establishment figures want to depress turnout, as turnout threatens their locus of control.'
"The all new 'Deep State Deep Dish Pizza' comes with a sprinkling of black 'ape' hate and extra conspiracy Twitter theories spread by Russian bots."
'Ok good we have the killer and the murder weapon, but we still have to figure out which room it is. I have it narrowed down to the conservatory, the study, or the kitchen but I’m just not confident enough to guess yet.'
"Dirty money is absolutely a crime when it's subverting sanctions against individuals and foreign entities."
'I think a large enough chunk of the American electorate is pissed off enough that they will have to. Besides that, think of how much information Trump has had access to in the past year? He would sell that shit to anyone. The safest place for him to be with our American secrets is solitary confinement in a super max. \n\nDo I as a private citizen have the power to make that happen? nah brah. But Trump has shit on career spooks for over a year, including firing McCabe 26 hrs before retirement. I think it is reasonable to expect there are many in the IC that want him ground in to dust. '
'And now you know why folks refuse to budge on gun control.\n\nThis. Right here. "Conservatives are gunna kill us liburals and stop our takeover, so let\'s seize all weapons!"\n\nEver other non-zealot sees "jesus, the lefties are as insane as the conservatives - we better improve gun rights to defend ourselves against both these sides from seizing our government".\n\n\nDo you get it?'
'Oh we remember.  We also remember when he lied about the info he took from the White House then brought it back to the White House.  He is part of the propaganda machine of this pathetic administration.  The rule of law and the real patriots will win.  '
'I mean he supposedly has assaulted a wife before...\n\n> ["The private account was described in former Newsweek reporter Harry Hurt III’s 1993 book, Lost Tycoon. It details the alleged "violent assault," in which Trump pulled out fistfuls of his ex-wife’s hair after receiving a painful operation on his scalp.](http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-rape-sexual-assault-minor-wife-business-victims-roy-moore-713531)\n\n"Honorable" mention goes to Michael Cohen saying: \n\n>"By the very definition, you can\'t rape your spouse."\n\nBunch of stand up guys we got here (allegedly).\n'
"Since this kind of thing has leaked before and he denied it, he may be trying to play Mueller and Trump against each other by signaling both  just to see who reaches out and what they offer.  \n\nI think it stinks of desperation, there's no question that he's guilty of something (a lot of somethings), so the question becomes who can reward and protect him best and who has the ability to hurt him worse long term. "
'He’s only willing to talk to prosecutors because the investigation is secretly all about Hillary Clinton! Which is why Trump is trying to shut the investigation down...no that can’t be right. \n\nIt’s politically motivated harassment because it was started and is run by...Republicans? Hold on. \n\nVeselnitskaya only said that she takes orders from Putin in order to sow chaos in the West because Putin ordered her to... something’s not right here. \n\nAh, I got it! The Stormy Daniels contract is fake, which is why the courts should enforce the arbitration agreement in it. I give up. '
'If this piece of shit brings down Orange Hitler, I will buy the book he ghost-writes from prison'
'He once said he would take a bullet for trump, imagine how pissed off he must be to do this.'
'Flip, motherfucker, flip'
'No time to waste get them all and throw them all in the clink'
"Just the fact that he's willing to talk means he's fucked and that raid had some real goodies in it. He'll flip."
"Let's be real; there is no way Trump is getting out of this unless he pulls a dictator move and seizes the government. Trump's family, his business, his cabinet, his business partners, his campaign managers, even his lawyers are up to their neck in money laundering, trading favors back and forth with foreign governments, campaign finance violations, violations of campaign laws aimed to limit the involvement  of foreign nationals in USA elections, misuse of government funds, lawsuits from porn stars, false statements under oath, and some are probably compromised due to blackmail - which, if that's the case, Mueller will have information about. Trump can delay and stonewall all he wants, but these cases are moving forward at the Federal AND State level, and while he could potentially end the Federal probe if he's willing to go full dictator AND if congress doesn't do anything to prevent that (which I don't honestly doubt so long as Republicans are in power), he doesn't have the power to end the state level probes. If Democrats gain congress he'll be gone in a week; this shit with the child interment camps has been the last straw for a lot of Republicans and Independents - they wouldn't rally behind him if Democrats forced him out of office as soon as they gain the Senate and House. Even the Pope has spoken out against mistreating migrants and children."
"It was the same with the Enron investigation. That's how you investigate a large criminal conspiracy: you go after the underlings to build a case against the managers, then you go after the managers to build a case against the top dogs.\n\nThe fact that DT could still be named. Or not. But the fact that he hasn't been named _definitely_ doesn't mean he won't be named."
'No, you’re not alone. My fear all along has been (and still is) that the way this will end is that the Manaforts and Cohens (and some foreign nationals who they can’t bring to justice in the US) will end up in prison and there will be lots of indirect links to Chump; but not enough for a clear criminal case. And the Republicans won’t impeach him just to hang on to power until 2020 (at least). '
'No way in hell Trump avoids New York state prison for a lifetime of money laundering, fraud, etc. '
'They are in other threads busy trying to defend the brutal child abuse going on at the border concentration camps.'
"Oh, shit, I hadn't thought about that, but you're right. They're always accusing the Clintons of murder and we all know how they project their own illegal actions on her. "
"The United States courts do not recognize censorship. An aggrieved person may sue for damages but the courts will not issue an order barring the printing of a book.\n\nTrump's lawyers know that. This is all posturing for their base because they know their base is too stupid to know better."
'Guys, The Boy Who Cried Fake News says this book is all lies. I guess we better believe him, eh?'
'Listen I hate trump more the any other sane person but we should all take this book with a large grain of salt. The author is a known liar and his “facts” are disputed all the time.'
'There are a hell of a lot of things above that on the list of things Trump needs to acquaint himself with.'
'The guy was only able to write the book because nobody at the White House was checking credentials or restricting guests in any way.\n\nHe literally just hung around there and talked to people.  Trump is terrified because he knows that this guy heard some things...'
"It's also been corroborated. And it meshes perfectly with the view from the outside. And the guy actually was physically there, in the white house, for all of this shit. So if people are saying he's full of shit, then he must've seen what was actually going on but decided not to write about that for some reason. Too boring, maybe? The president was so competent and controlled and smart that there weren't any crises or conflict, so he made up a weird story about an idiot instead. That's probably what happened. /s"
'Devils advocate: it is bs, but the content will be used to reinforce his bad image anyway'
"Does it matter?\n\nHe has no legal traction on this at all.\n\nHe is not a private citizen anymore. I could publish a book tomorrow saying he eats his own shit and he couldn't touch me."
"I think it'd be a dangerous precedent to hold that an elected official forfeits his private rights upon assumption of his public duties. There's no authority for that position currently in the law, anyway. Moreover the cease and desist you're referring to was directed at Bannon, and alleges breach of contract. To my knowledge, no one, on Trump's behalf, has directed Wolff or his publisher to do anything."
"It's crazy how few people are aware they're living through the biggest scandal in modern political history. If the allegations in the Dossier are true (and lots of details from that Dossier have been corroborated), then this is by far one of the biggest scandals in the history of our country."

'Damn, this Admin thought Mueller was bad? Avenatti is no joke.'
'So when they make the movie about all this shit, I see the two main Oscar bait rolls being Avenatti and Mueller and the writer and directors are going to have a fun time weaving these two very different men, their styles and avenues of attacking in and out of each other as the story progresses.\n\nAnd the actors that get those parts are going to have a blast. '
'I started second guessing myself and deleted this comment once, but I re-read the subject matter and decided to re-post.\n\nTwitter handle @stephaniefishm4 replied to Avenatti several times - someone else please read the replies and check if I’m interpreting correctly.\n\nHer argument seems to be that Trump killed the Iran deal in order to block Boeing’s $16.6B contract with Iran, with a new Russia-China joint venture (CRAIC) currently attempting to undercut Boeing and take 10% market share. If they were to get the contract it would be incredibly shady.'

"This is awesome and all, but why exactly is Avenatti the one doing this? As a separate case from Mueller, how close is he involved to be highlighting the Russia stuff? I mean, Trump's life is one big scam, but how much is Mueller involving Avenatti, is Avenatti going after Trump on more than Stormy legally?"

'That\'s called a "criminal syndicate."\n\nAt its very worst, too. It\'s no city they\'re undermining; they\'re defrauding the world.'
"Yeah but nothing can happen till the investigation is air-tight. Theyve been gathering lots of new evidence and there have already been nearly 30 indictments. There's no doubt Trump had ties to Russia and that Russia meddled with the election but until they have black and white proof it's just accusational"
"I'm just waiting for Puigdemont being indicted. No way in hell Russia wasn't involved in Catalunya's unrest."
'I know but there is real damage being done now that doesn’t have anything to do with the investigation and there is no one keeping him in check. Aside from a small handful of outspoken congressmen, it’s radio silence on all of this insanity. The Mueller investigation might not be done for a long time yet and it feels like we are just sitting around waiting to see how bad it can get. That doesn’t give me much hope. That along with the propaganda problem we have in addition to the infiltration of conservative billionaire influence, finding out if Trump worked with the Russians seems a bit moot at this point anyway. We all know he did.  The evidence is out in the open. Collusion, obstruction of justice, money laundering, we have seen it all. Nothing seems to matter. It’s enough to make me think I’m the crazy one. '
"The low ethics and corruption aren't part of Mueller's investigation (so far). He was tasked with investigating Russian interference with the 2016 election and any crimes uncovered in the course of that investigation. If during his investigation, he uncovers incriminating communications (such as telling foreign governments to launder campaign funds theough the NRA or a quid pro quo bribery deal) between Trump, the Trump Campaign, or one of the people associated with the campaign or administration with anybody else then that would become part of the investigation. When you're investigating such corrupt people, you're bound to have a lot of avenues to investigate. Everything you find that looks fishy, has to be fully investigated. \n\nCurrently, it's the job of Congress and the Department of Justice to oversee the Trump administration's compliance with laws and ethics. Sessions isn't really interested in doing that. He's more interested in pursuing his long held anti-immigrant and anti-minority policies. The Republican Congress isn't interested in acting as a brake on the worst instincts of Trump or his appointees because the Republicans in charge are scared of Trump tweets and they're getting what they want for now. There will be no meaningful oversight of the Trump Administration until Democrats have control of at least one chamber of Congress."
"They've also infiltrated the online African American community. A couple months ago it was discovered that dozens of online activists were actually Russians sowing discord and discouraging people from voting Clinton by stirring up resentment. And that's just the ones that were caught. \n\nSo on one hand you've got Russians stirring up racists, and on the other you have Russians stirring up the anti-racists. \n\nIt was not pretty."
"You're right. I don't see what this nothingburger is all about. \n\nIts hard for me to see any Trump ties to Russia—I mean, except for the Flynn thing and the Manafort thing and the Tillerson thing and the Sessions thing and the Kushner thing and the Wray thing and the Morgan, Lewis, & Bockius “Russian Law Firm of the Year” thing and the Carter Page thing and the Roger Stone thing and the 198 Million voter records thing and the Felix Sater thing and the Boris Ephsteyn thing and the Rosneft thing and the Gazprom thing and the Sergey Gorkov banker thing and the Azerbajain thing and the “I love Putin” thing and the Donald Trump, Jr. thing and the Lavrov thing and the Sergey Kislyak thing and the Oval Office thing and the Gingrich/Kislyak phone calls thing and the Russian Business Interests thing and the Emoluments Clause thing and the Alex Schnaider thing and the hack of the DNC thing and the Guccifer 2.0 thing and the Mike Pence “I don’t know anything” thing and the Russians mysteriously dying thing and Trump’s public request to Russia to hack Hillary’s email thing and the Trump house sale for $100 million at the bottom of the housing bust to the Russian fertilizer king thing and the Russian fertilizer king’s plane showing up in Concord, NC during Trump rally campaign thing and the Nunes sudden flight to the White House in the night thing and the Nunes personal investments in the Russian winery thing and the Cyprus bank thing and Trump not releasing his tax returns thing and the Republican Party’s rejection of an amendment to require Trump to show his taxes thing and the election hacking thing and the GOP platform change to the Ukraine thing and the Steele Dossier thing and the Sally Yates can’t testify thing and the intelligence community’s investigative reports thing and the Trump reassurance that the Russian connection is all “fake news” thing and the Chaffetz not willing to start an investigation thing and the Chaffetz suddenly deciding to go back to private life in the middle of an investigation thing and the appointment of Pam Bondi who was bribed by Trump in the Trump University scandal appointed to head the investigation thing and the alfa-bank thing and the VEB thing and the The White House going into full-on cover-up mode, refusing to turn over the documents related to the hiring and subsequent firing of Flynn thing and the Chaffetz and White House blaming the poor vetting of Flynn on Obama thing and the Poland and British intelligence gave information regarding the hacking back in 2015 to Paul Ryan and he «didn't do anything» thing and the Agent M16 following the money thing and the Trump team KNEW about Flynn's involvement but hired him anyway thing and the let’s fire Comey thing and the Mueller let’s fire him too thing and the Election night Russian trademark gifts thing and the Russian diplomatic compound electronic equipment destruction thing and the let’s give back the diplomatic compounds to the Russians thing and the let’s back away from Cuba thing and the donny Jr met with Russians thing and Trump's secret second meeting with his boss Putin thing and the Steve Bannon telling the world the Trump Tower meeting was “treasonous” thing or the Russian Oligarchs attending his inauguration thing or the Alex Van Der Zwaan indictment or the Rick Gates plea deal thing or Hope Hicks resigning after congressional testimony thing or the Erik Prince Seychelles back channel to Russia thing or the Michael Cohen lying about Prague, bragging about Russian mafia ties, or taking money from Viktor Vekselberg things or even Trump’s lawyers admitting Trump dictated his son’s public response to the Veselnitskaya meeting he “didn’t know anything about”.\n\nTotal crazy conspiracy theory."

'This wasn\'t a meeting request.\n\nThis was a subpoena.  You don\'t "Agree" to appear under subpoena.  You show up and answer questions under oath, or you face contempt of court charges.\n\nWhich is probably why he was pissed when the FBI showed up at his door... With a subpoena to appear.'

"I'm sure Mueller's team already knows what questions they want answers to. They'll either get real answers, fake answers or no answers and likely take any other erroneous material Bannon gives with a grain of salt."
'I doubt it at this point. As I’ve said, I’m sure Bannon has been high up on Mueller’s watch list, but unlike Flynn and Manafort, there were no prior criminal investigations that Mueller could use to get him to talk (unless there’s something else that Mueller and co have been keeping private). My guess is that the FBI team has been waiting it out, knowing that eventually, Bannon would fall out of favor, and would then be more willing to squeal. Bannon is washed up at this point: his donors have cut him off, and the far right/alt right falls in with trump at the end of the day, so he doesn’t have much to lose by talking.'

Mueller will prove beyond any doubt that Trump is dirty and anyone, like Nunes who covered for him will be seen as dirty too.\n\nThis memo is a pathetic attempt to delegitimatize the investigation.

And then we learn what the basis was for action X and it\'s necessary and justified.\n\nDo they really want to go through another cycle of this stupidity at this point?'
'This is fucking terrifying though, it is one thing to think that Trump mixed himself up with the Russians - he became a Republican just before running for president - but the willingness of actual long elected Republican lawmakers to try to undermine an FBI investigation into treasonous behaviour is galling.

So I just said "fuck it, even if it IS all a partisan attack, Hillary\'s sat in a fucking chair for 11 hours on Benghazi, so they can go fuck themselves."'
'Like that fake dossier Obama and Clinton used to get an illegal wiretap from a FISA court to illegally spy on Trump?'
'Because the memo is bullshit and the only way to verify any of it would be to release a lot more information which would likely paint them in a bad light. \n\nThen again their idiot supporters are already taking a memo none of them have read as gospel. '
'I think saying the FBI is pro trump or pro Clinton is wrong. Certain people are politically biased, and abuse their power to support it, for both candidates. That is a very bad thing. Unfortunately it is a partisan issue now so nothing good will come of this, but that does need to be addressed. Strozk and Lisa Page were clearly pro Clinton. I am not sure who the Trump moles were, but clearly there were some. \n\nThe FBI does NOT need to be doing that shit. PR and elections is not what they should be doing. '

He purchased a unit in Trump Tower I for $830,000 in 2010, according to the Miami-Dade Property Appraiser.\n\nPeter Kiritchenko, a Ukrainian businessman who prosecutors accused of laundering tens of millions of dollars alongside that country's former prime minister Pavel Lazarenko. He pleaded guilty to one count of receipt of stolen property and testified against Lazarenko, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office's for the North District of California. Kiritchenko's daughter, Lidia, paid $1.25 million for a unit in Trump Tower II in 2013, acording to the Miami-Dade Property Appraiser.\n\nEduard Nektalov, a Uzbeki diamond dealer was arrested on charges he laundered drug money before he was killed in New York, according to multiple news reports. He purchased a unit at Trump World Tower for $1.6 million in 2003, according to the New York City Department of Finance.\n\nThe Sivokozov family, which has ties to organized crime, according to various Russian media reports. Patriarch Vasily Sivokozov was director of a Russian bank whose license was revoked, according to the reports. His son, Igor, went into business with a Russian-American criminal who had been convicted of fraud. Igor Sivokozov and his daughter, Natalia, paid $660,000 for a unit in Trump Royale in 2015 though the assessed market value was $483,223. Natalia Sivokozova bought two units at Trump Royale, one in 2015 for $675,000 — which had an assessed market value of $534,630 — and another for $1.3 million — which had an assessed market value of $923,803 — in 2016. Her sister, Ksenia Sivokozova, paid $675,000 for a fourth unit in 2015, though it had a market value of $474,474.\n\nBurman, who does not have a medical license, opened six clinics in Brooklyn as part of a scheme to defraud Medicare and New York State Medicaid programs of more than $26 million between 2007 and 2013, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. It was during that time in 2009 that he paid $725,000 for a unit at Trump Tower I in Sunny Isles Beach, according to the Miami-Dade Property Appraiser. Burman, who was born in Kiev and came to the U.S. in 1992 , pleaded guilty and, in May 2017, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. \n\nZeldovich, who according to social media is likely from Minsk, Belarus, had a company accused of violating anti-monopoly laws and may have continued to do business in Crimea, despite U.S. prohibitions about doing business there after Russia annexed it from Ukraine, according to Russian news reports. Zeldovich and his wife, Erna, purchased two Trump Place units in 2007, one for $790,000 and another for $995,000, according to the New York City Department of Finance. They spent $750,000 for a Trump Royale unit in 2008, making them one of the first buyers, according to the Miami-Dade Property Appraiser. Zeldovich Living Trust, which lists Zeldovich as a representative , spent $1.85 million on a unit at Trump Place in 2010, according to the New York City Department of Finance.\n\nRomashov served as chairman of the board of Transoil when it was on the Treasury Department’s sanctions list in March 2014. Transoil was founded by Russian billionaire Gennady Timchenko, who has close ties to Putin and is under U.S. sanctions. Romashov paid $620,000 cash for a unit in Trump Tower I in Sunny Isles Beach in 2010, according to the Miami-Dade Property Appraiser."

Trump Jr. himself revealed this.\n\n5) In July, 2016, Trump asked Russia to hack and release email belonging to US persons and organizations.\n\n6) Mueller has now indicted Russian government agents for doing exactly that.\n\nAs it stands: the Trump / White House response has been to show complete indifference to the fact that Russian government agents attacked the US -- to float bullshit conspiracy theories -- and to lie about what the Justice Department reported.

It also makes him an accessory to the Trump Tower meeting crime directly admitted to by Don Jr. and Kushner both of whom tweeted their own emails from the campaign. These emails were corroborated by Don Trump Jr. in a separate tweet. Both men have stated publicly that these tweets were real and from them. — In these tweeted images, Jr. states his intention and frame of mind plainly in the first image as, "The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was political opposition research... I decided to take the meeting" We now know that Kushner and Don Jr. believed the meeting to be about a thing of value, political opposition research.

'**Cohen claims Trump knew in advance of 2016 Trump Tower meeting**\n\nCohen\'s claim would contradict repeated denials by Trump, Donald Trump Jr., their lawyers and other administration officials who have said that the President knew nothing about the Trump Tower meeting until he was approached about it by The New York Times in July 2017.\n\nCohen alleges that he was present, along with several others, when Trump was informed of the Russians\' offer by Trump Jr. By Cohen\'s account, Trump approved going ahead with the meeting with the Russians, according to sources.\n\nTo be clear, these sources said Cohen does not have evidence, such as audio recordings, to corroborate his claim, but he is willing to attest to his account.\n\nCohen privately testified last year to two Congressional committees investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. A source familiar with Cohen\'s House testimony said he did not testify that Trump had advance knowledge. Cohen\'s claims weren\'t mentioned in separate reports issued by Republicans and Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nContacted by CNN, one of Cohen\'s attorneys, Lanny Davis, declined to comment.\n\nRudy Giuliani, the President\'s attorney, said of Cohen, "He\'s certainly a source that is not credible."\n\n"Donald Trump Jr. has been professional and responsible throughout the Mueller and Congressional investigations," said Alan Futerfas, an attorney for Donald Trump Jr. "We are very confident of the accuracy and reliability of the information that has been provided by Mr. Trump, Jr., and on his behalf."\n\nAccording to people who have discussed the matter with Cohen, he has expressed hope that this claim about the Trump Tower meeting will help him reach out to Mueller and possibly lessen his legal troubles. He\'s under scrutiny by federal prosecutors in Manhattan after Mueller referred Cohen\'s case to them.\n\nThe June 2016 meeting was arranged after a publicist who knew Trump Jr. told him in emails -- in no uncertain terms -- that a senior Russian official "offered to provide the Trump campaign" with damaging information about Clinton, and that the outreach was "part of Russia and its government\'s support for Mr. Trump." At the time, the Russian operation to covertly boost Trump\'s candidacy wasn\'t publicly known. Trump. Jr. responded, "if it\'s what you say, I love it," and started to arrange the meeting.\n\nAt the meeting, Trump Jr. was joined by his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, who was Trump\'s campaign chairman at the time. There were four Russians in the room, including a lawyer with Kremlin ties, a businessman who worked for an oligarch and a lobbyist with old KGB connections.\n\nAfter news of the meeting broke in July 2017, the Trump team offered misleading explanations and changed their story several times. But one claim stayed consistent: that Trump had no knowledge of the meeting beforehand, wasn\'t told about it afterward and first learned about it one year later.\n\nThose denials were repeatedly issued by Trump, his attorney Jay Sekulow, Trump Jr., Futerfas and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. Those people denied that Trump had contemporaneous knowledge of the meeting on more than 15 occasions, according to CNN\'s analysis.\n\nTrump said on July 12, 2017, that he "only heard about it two or three days ago." One week later, Trump repeated that he "didn\'t know anything about the meeting" because "nobody told me" about it.\n\nAround that same time, CNN\'s Jake Tapper asked Sekulow to confirm Trump\'s claims that he only recently learned about the controversial meeting. Sekulow\'s response: "Yes, I swear."\n\nBut perhaps the highest-stakes denial was given by Trump Jr. in his testimony last year to the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n"He wasn\'t aware of it," Trump Jr. told lawmakers, referring to his father\'s knowledge of the meeting. "And, frankly, by the time anyone was aware of it, which was summer of this year, as I stated earlier, I wouldn\'t have wanted to get him involved in it because it had nothing to do with him."\n\nTrump\'s critics have long doubted these denials. They point to a series of phone calls Trump Jr. made to a blocked phone number before and after the meeting. They also note that two days before the meeting, Trump mysteriously announced plans to give a "major speech" about Clinton\'s scandals. Trump Jr. says he didn\'t get any dirt at the meeting -- and the speech never happened.\n\nEven Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist and top Trump campaign official, said the meeting was "treasonous" and speculated that "the chance that Don Jr. did not walk these (Russians) up to his father\'s office on the twenty-sixth floor is zero." Trump Jr. has denied Bannon\'s allegation. Bannon\'s comments, to author Michael Wolff for his book "Fire and Fury," triggered the bitter public divorce between Bannon and Trump in early 2018.\n\nAxios reported that Bannon does not have first-hand knowledge about whether Trump Jr. told his father, and Bannon later said his "treasonous" remark was directed at Manafort and not Trump Jr.\n\n✌ cool people read before commenting ✌'

Knowing the conniving nature and whole cloth dishonesty of Trump no objective person could say Trump was out of the loop. It is the tattered vestiges of the Office of President that has always given Trump shade. ‘If the President said he didn’t know about the meeting....’ then it seems the circumstantial reality is too speculative because he holds the Office. No more shade. Assuming Cohen gives this evidence his is the period at the end of the sentence already made: Trump knew of, colluded to approve the meeting , had its outcome reported to him and in national coverage asked Russia to go full steam ahead in its interference. \n\nThe reality is that Trump is and has always been a liar, but  his higher presumed standard to prove same is now solidly forming.'

The uranium deposits are of relatively poor grade and are too costly to compete on the uranium market. But the facilities do have good milling capacity to process ore, if anyone gives it to them, which hasn’t happened in about 10 years. Theoretically, they could process 20% of our ore, but that will never happen. Uranium One couldn’t give these facilities away.\n\n>\tBesides, Russia can’t export any uranium they produce in the U.S. They do not possess a Nuclear Regulatory Commission export license.\n\n>\tCandidate Trump jumped on this issue during the 2016 campaign trail last year, but as secretary of state, Clinton was not involved in the committee review and never intervened on the matter, and there were several other agencies involved in the recommendation.\n\nIt’s complete bullshit, in other words.

Classic “Good American” ignorance. \n\nTo be clear, I’m *not* arguing that the people listed in this post’s title aren’t guilty. In fact, I suspect most/all of them they are—to some extent—guilty as sin. That being said....\n\n*All* facts considered, trusting the FBI to investigate Trump—or corruption in general—makes about as much sense as trusting *Trump* to investigate Trump. You’d have to be a naïve fool who’s oblivious to modern world history to support such a shortsighted and self-defeating course of action.\n\nIf America’s Democrats (faux-liberals) were as intellectually-independent, informed, and noble as they present themselves to be, and if America’s Republicans (faux-conservatives) were as intellectual, informed, and noble as they present themselves to be, they wouldn’t constantly be playing into this divisive, billionaire-sponsored game of cutthroat pseudo-politics. Rather, they would be communicating, uniting, and organizing to investigate *both* Trump and the FBI, not to mention the Federal Government and the Corporate MSM at large, and to hold all relevant parties accountable for their misdeeds.\n\nAlas, American democrats and conservatives will only support a cause if it’s petty, cheap, and convenient, and only if it doesn’t require them to admit that they’ve been completely wrong about something important. All of you act surprised when the state of the nation—and the world we’ve actively been bullying into submission for decades—keeps getting worse, and worse, and worse.

Truth hurts, and it’s humbling, *especially* for modern Americans. Grow the heck up, and face the ugly reality that our willful ignorance has fostered so we can stand a fighting chance at repairing our fucked up world before we drive humanity to self-destruct beyond repair.

'Thanks for actually engaging me in conversation! Most people just insult me, and make no effort to actually converse.\n\nTo be honest, I think you’ve lost sight of the fine line that separates pessimism from realism in the world of politics. The problem isn’t that “politicians on both sides can lack testicles”. That’s a severely naïve assessment if you ask me. \n\nThe problem—in a nutshell—is that our entire political system has been entirely corrupted by the wealthy and well-connected—people who either rose to power by selling their souls in order to excel at cutthroat capitalism, or who inherited their power and feel like dominion over commoners is their birthright. \n\nOn top of that, the problem is that popular opinion is now *literally* dictated by those same people via mainstream media, which has come to be controlled *exclusively* by that particular class of person via finance. Both the mainstream liberal media and the mainstream conservative media (the only news media Americans take seriously) are entirely subservient to the people who can afford to finance them. Because of this, investigative journalism has effectively gone extinct, only to be replaced by brainwashy, subversive, and intellectually dishonest sensationalism. After all, investigative journalists live to expose corruption and abuses of power, which is extremely bad for business if you’re one of the corrupt, power-hungry financiers behind every for-profit news conglomerate from FOX to CNN. The free press is supposed to be a weapon the people can wield against would-be tyrants. Now, thanks to the corrupting power of money, it’s a weapon that the wealthy and well-connected wield against the people with devastating efficiency and cunning. These days, virtually every incriminating truth and innovative idea that could stand to shift the balance of power towards the people and away from the wealthy is drowned out by an endless stream of sensationalist propaganda. Rogue dissidents who somehow manage to make themselves heard invariably have their credibility baselessly eviscerated by a legion of corporate reporters. News flash: if dozens of corporate reporters publicly denounce an individual as a liar, even if that individual is the only person who’s actually standing by the truth, people will believe it, no matter what. Obviously, such cases are the exception, not the rule, but the fact that people can— and *do*—get away with this sort of scheme is a *huge* red flag. The way our government and media treat whistleblowers is proof enough of this concept. Gary Webb is a shining example of how this happens. If you don’t know about him, the movie Kill The Messenger does an excellent job of telling his story. Really, you can read up on *any* modern American whistleblower to verify the validity of this claim.\n\nI’m not going to bother touching on how mass media can easily be used to manipulate public elections. After all, every American liberal is up in arms over Trump/Russia because of this, although I can’t even begin to fathom why liberals can’t bring themselves to recognize that *American* propaganda has the exact same effect on our political process as Russian propaganda, albeit to a much, *much* greater magnitude. \n\nOn top of all *that*, the problem is that the American people at large have no interest whatsoever in suspending their blissfully naïve, narrow-scoped, mass-media-driven “worldviews” long enough to let reality set in, because they’re too stubborn, too afraid, and too arrogant to admit that they’ve let themselves be manipulated by homegrown corporate propagandists. Liberals overwhelmingly do this. Conservatives overwhelmingly do this. Both sides *regularly* call one another out for doing this. Yet, evidently, both sides would sooner let the world descend into chaos and violence than they would admit that they’ve been acting like moronic hypocrites this whole time. \n\nBy the way, the way Democrats have reacted to this Russian propaganda pseudo-scandal has effectively sent this message to the world: “It’s okay if *we* meddle in other nation’s governments, and bully them into submission with our military and economic might, but if any of you try doing it to us, we’ll come unhinged.” Not a great message for American liberals to send to the world when we’re trying to earn their respect, support, and cooperation. I’d encourage you to revisit the claims I made about the FBI in my original comment while keeping that thought in mind. The FBI—not to mention American law enforcement in general—has always been an anti-liberal organization, and this is *exactly* the kind of deceitful, manipulative tactic that people in power use to undermine public support for liberal causes. Seriously, read up on COINTELPRO and modern counterintelligence tactics, and prepare to have your mind blown.\n\nAll in all, American politics has gone from being a respectable profession of public service to being a cutthroat game played by aloof upper-echelon narcissists, and oblivious idiots who are too naïve to threaten the status quo. Similarly, American news media have gone from being principled bastions of truth to being omnipresent propaganda machines that work exclusively for the radically wealthy. Until Americans can come to terms with the fact the free press died on our watch, and that we let our government become corrupt while we were busy getting drunk, watching sports, and hanging out at the mall, the free press will stay dead, and nothing will ever change. \n\nNow, for the love of humanity, you folks *have* to stop blaming conservatives for running our nation—and the world—into the ground, because you’re just as guilty as they are. Just because you were smart enough to recognize that Donald Trump—the most obviously corrupt presidential candidate in American history—is a crook, and just because you’re not brainwashed enough to fear immigrants doesn’t mean you haven’t been blindly aligning yourselves with crooks each and every time you vote, and it doesn’t mean you haven’t been brainwashed too.\n\nThe sad irony here is that you believe *I’m* the pessimist, when you’re the one who’s clearly resigned himself to this insane game of divisive, anti-productive, cutthroat politics, and I’m the one who wholeheartedly believes that we can *definitely* fix all this shit if we just stop playing into this game by ruthlessly and hypocritically shaming each other for making mistakes that we’ve *all* been making, and start working together instead. \n\nAt any rate, after seeing all the arrogant, self-righteous, and hypocritical bullshit that Democrats have been spewing since the 2016 election, I can say for certain that I’m never voting democrat again. Obviously I won’t be voting republican either., but y’all lost my loyalty when you became completely unhinged after losing to Trump—*the most blatantly corrupt presidential candidate of all time*. The fact that we lost to him should have been a huge wake up call for Democrats. Instead, dems are using it as an excuse to ridicule and alienate people who are marginally less worldly-wise than they are—the people we need to team up with if we want to un-corrupt our government and media so they start working *for* the people, not against them.\n\nAnyways, thanks again for engaging me in conversation! I hope I was able to get you thinking!\n\nAll the best, cool guy!'

He deserves the same outfit, same shoes, same meals, same daily routine, everything, as a petty street criminal. '
'I don’t give a rats ass about his lifestyle. I just want his ability to do more crime disabled and want his testimony to disable more criminals'
'But there may very well be a reason for it. Look at what just happened yesterday. Manafort tries to argue that the trial needs to be postponed; he’s trying to stall. But because he’s being treated so lavishly, mueller was able to argue that he’s full of shit, and rattled off a list of conveniences Manafort enjoys. Bingo bango, trial is not delayed. It’s a great move on mueller’s part. '
"If you think he's going to a real prison, I've got a bridge to sell you.\n\nThis piece of shit needs to testify then be put to the gallows."
"Why do you think that? Life in prison the threat being placed against him, so he can either testify and receive a lighter sentence or life in prison. I don't think his loyalty is to Trump or anyone else in the White House, I would guess it's to himself."
'If you read the full quote, it is much more benign. \n\n>the professionals at Alexandria Detention Center are very familiar with housing high-profile defendants, including foreign and domestic terrorists, spies and traitors.\n\nIn reality, he just called Manafort a "high-profile defendant" which is absolutely true.'
"Yeah of course. No man should be prosecuted if they didn't commit the crime. However, it would be equally fucked up for him to get off if he did commit the crime because of a bias jury in his favor, which is exactly what his lawyers are trying to do. I know it's all part of the game, but ridiculous either way. With all the evidence they have, I don't see how he isn't guilty. I really hope if he is, they make an example out of him and prosecute to the fullest extent. "
"No, this is actually how we should be treating everyone. Because as much as I hate the man, he hasn't been shown to be a criminal, as you say,  yet and should be treated as innocent. "

">Repeating the same thing twice doesn't really imply he's answering both questions one after another...\n\nI was more referring the fact that the translator ignored the part where he said “Yes, I did want Trump to win”, simplifying it down to a simple “Yes”.\n\nAlso, just to clarify, I am by no means attempting to redeem or defend Putin here. I simply want to avoid truth being based on misinformation. Modifying translations in order to push an agenda only serves to undermine the position of those attempting to bring criminals to justice.\n\nEdit: a word"
'It\'s irrelevant what the rest of it was, it was a political bait, that he obviously never answered, and never in fucking seven hells would touch to answer.\n\nBut hey, keep stirring drama out of nothing. I don\'t know what you base your "weaker" than ever on, as far as I know you\'re spending more money on war than ever, as well as your collective market caps of various companies like apple and amazon are reaching biblical numbers. I guess your president isn\'t very good at the whole twitter and public image thing? Sucks that THAT is what matters so much to you, LOL. A nation of idiots who must have an enemy somewhere far away to not kill each other at schools, honestly. You\'re the jokes who deserve their president. He is the ultimate image of yourselves.\n\nYou get one president who\'s solution to war is more war, and solution to economic crisis is printing a metric shit ton of currency out of thin air and giving it out to gamblers at 0% interest, and you praise the guy. Like he\'s the best thing that happened to you. You get some next idiot, who\'s just as shit at actually ruling, and only ever does what he\'s told by his advisers and campaign contributors, like the previous one, but GOD DAMN he\'s bad at public image sharades, and holy shit it\'s like you\'re gona go to war with each other. This is the reality of politics across the entire globe. Presidents and ministers, aren\'t exactly the kings of old who rule everything and everyone. They fucking depend on a whole lot of fucking people. And often these people\'s interests are put first, usually it\'s the elite or corporate. Get out of your bedroom at some point.'

"This is completely false.  His points are generally vapid and when it comes to policy, you can see he has no core political philosophy nor moral philosophy.  He's simply anti-trump no matter what.\n\nAnd when it comes to this investigation, he as emotionally compromised as the rest of you in the sub.  He constantly jumps to conclusions, ignores inconvenient facts that don't fit your narrative, and relies on hypotheticals.\n\nTo address your point with leading with threats: he absolutely does.  One instance was when the memo was coming out and the idiots at the FBI and Schiff claimed that it would endanger lives if it were released.  Of course, it did not do that, nor could it have.\n\nSo pretty much everything you claim about him is wrong."

"He is doing so on purpose. He talks about Trump's criminal actions on purpose in order to politicize the very idea of crime. "
'No they arent the same, the left is much more subtle playing the long con and are willing to wait the people out till they willfully accept giving up total control. Read a book called set up and sold out, it came out about 25-30 years ago and detailed how it will be accomplished, its scary how it played out almost to the letter. \n\nLook I dont trust either side but in the future the left will be the totalitarians in control as long as the media keeps spoon feeding their bullshit. They will keep it going as being in the best interest for the people which is complete bullshit that all of you are greedily lapping up. \n\nAnyone who wants the control to make their own decisions will be labeled as conspiracy nuts or domestic  terrorists to keep everyone else in line. \n\nAlso I dont read any of the sites as infowars are completely crazy, Breitbart went off the deep end once Andrew died, and Russia has no desire to see trump in office.

You complain as if I suggested conservatism is the solution to all problems, despite the fact that I said that neither conservatism nor liberalism is the answer, but instead a reasonable middle between them.\n4. You complete your irrational complaint against arguments I didn’t make by telling me to grow up.\n\nLike I said, the real key is listening. It’s worth trying.'
"That's the dodge of the left, all the right is cramming religion down your throat yet trump got the nomination and is not even religious.  \n\nThe right is not pushing religion and a majority of the party does not believe religion should be part of their platform. \n\nThe point of the long con is the trap is pulled before you even know it happened and what's more is they make you believe it was your idea. \n\nRead the book, it's scary how accurate it was at predicting this current bullshit.

"Wasn't the main thing said about Lee Atwater the Willie Horton ad though?  About how racist and evil it was?\n\nHow can you say a story about a convicted murderer serving a life sentence who was given a furlough, and during that furlough, he kidnapped, pistol whipped and raped that woman during a furlough while serving a life sentence, was a racist attack on Dukakis?  I mean, black or white, why would you give a man like that a furlough who was serving a life sentence?  And why was it racist to point it out?\n\nIs this just one of the media rewriting to brand people racist when what they were saying had nothing to do about race?\n\nIt's just another example of how this current climate of calling people racists and Nazis is nothing new.  It's been going on for decades.\n\nEDIT: he raped the woman twice after pistol whipping, knifing and gagging her fiancé.  Michael Dukakis approved the man for a furlough while Horton was serving a sentence for murder.  I guess no one should have talked about it because Horton was black.\n\nEDIT 2:  The details of Horton's original crime are just as horrific, shoving a man into a trash can so his knees were against his chin after stabbing him multiple times, leaving the victim to die of blood loss."
'One point this article makes is about Kobach\'s ridiculous voter fraud commission. In the indictment, there are paragraphs about how the Russians spread rumors and posted about voter fraud. I hope everyone in Congress and the executive will quit squawking now about freaking voter fraud. There is and will never be a completely sure way to prevent fraud, but the incidents are so few that raising it as a "major abuse" is stupid.\n\nI gotta say, I\'m more impressed by Mueller and how he\'s building these cases as the days go by, and I was already damned impressed. Start at the bottom and indict your way up. '
"If Trump gets impeached or charged, it won't be for collusion or something similar\n\nIt will be for lying under oath\n\nMueller will ask him questions under oath. Easy softball questions. \n\nDid you know about X? Did you tell x to do Y? \n\nTrump will deny knowledge of any.\n\nMueller will catch him in lies based on evidence and testimony provided by people he flipped. \n\nTrump's undoing will be because of cover up not because of original acts... That may have not even been criminal but that he lied about under oath.\n\n"
'> Congressional Republicans would have no choice but to begin the impeachment process.\n\nAt this point, does anyone believe that the Republicans give a flying fuck about what they are supposed to do, about the country, about the optics?  As long as they can convince their base of idiots that nothing is happening (or better yet, to look over there), then they will keep on destroying the country. '
'A lot of bark but I haven’t seen anything worthwhile from this witch hunt disguised as an investigation. Also I’m not sure if our country would be better or worse with a President Pence instead. I am not going to hold my breath. I think if Mueller has anything damning against Trump he would be in a body bag by now. '
"it's been over a year of investigating and so far he has found NO collusion. This entire investigation is a phony scam and mueller is a loser. "
"LOOOL Could there be a more fake, bullshit source of news then the fucking femi-nazi, bitter, shrivelled cunts over at the Huffington Post. Trump cornered? LOL HOW? The indictment proves that neither governments had ANYTHING to do with it. It's fucking hilarious how 13 broken english speaking Russians apparently can have more of an impact on Americas election then the entire DNC and billions of dollars spent by left-wing media outlets like CNN, NBC, ABC, All trying to slander Trump. You guys fucking lost. Trumps not getting impeached. Why don't you idiots go out into the real world?"
'Oh dont post huffpost lol thats just sad'
'The voter fraud lie is an excuse to make it harder to vote which historically has prevented minorities from voting who lean democratic. It’s just another dirty trick the GOP is attempting to use to scratch and claw to stay in power '
"Voter fraud is a serious issue like exploding penis syndrome.  They're possible but highly improbable and sound pretty scary.  One way to 100% stamp out voter fraud is to mandate voting for everybody but for some politicians that would be a very scary prospect."
"Yeah. You're right it's not  going to be collusion! \n\n\nThis is conspiracy and sedition. We should start correcting ourselves, thank you. "
'The problem with this game Fox and others play is that they’re totally okay with exaggerating or flat out lying and then just pretending it never happened to try and push the news cycle one direction or another....  many of us are not okay with that.... rightly so.   Unfortunately they will remain the dictators of where things go next as long as they are willing to go further than us.     Huff post along with others are attempting to beat them at a game they cannot win unless they too are willing to go that extra lying insane mile.    Nothing will change until someone big in mainstream media is willing to put their network on the line to call trump and friends in Congress what they are: real traitors and threats to our national security.

Typically the people involved in such schemes have a baseline of intellect that prevents them from saying stupid stuff or, you know, running for the one office where every bad thing you ever did is bound to come up. The only thing truly unique is that those issues didn\'t derail his election. Usually running alone wouldn\'t be enough to get people on your ass so long as you are a non threat. He actually got elected despite all we already knew and was too stupid to shut the fuck up despite now clearly having the most bought out squad of minions one could hope for. He has put himself in a position where such an allegation is now a FUCKTON deadlier than it would have been had that magical "presidential" transformation happened, and the allegation itself is only being hurled because he is so fucking retarded that he called a country he laundered money through a shithole.\n\nHis comments about draining the swamp are ridiculous in retrsopect.

"[When Paul Manafort met Ferdinand Marcos in the 1980s, each had something the other wanted. . . . Marcos earmarked huge sums of cash for Reagan’s 1980 and 1984 campaigns — as much as $57 million, according to one claim made to Philippine investigators. There’s no evidence that any cash ever made it into Reagan’s coffers, which would have been illegal since U.S. election laws ban donations from foreigners. And, despite extensive government investigations on both sides of the Pacific into the freewheeling spending of the Marcos regime, there’s never before been much serious inquiry of what ultimately happened to the cash intended for political contributions. ](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/2016-donald-trump-paul-manafort-ferinand-marcos-philippines-1980s-213952)\n\nYeah, that Manafort.

'Conspiracy with a foreign power to influence an election through either direct compensation or quid pro quo is a federal crime. Depending on how deep and detailed and repetitive the acts of conspiracy and any exchange of money/influence then it is prosecutable. that is basically what they seem to be investigating. \n\n\ne.g. you agree for Putin (or some other foreign power) to peddle out their disinformation campaigns in exchange for Russian sanction relief then that is bad stuff and probably is conspiracy.\n\n\nthe word “collusion “ is a journalistic term. conspiracy is the more legal term and is what would be prosecuted.\n\n\nso yeah the “collusion isn’t illegal “ is really just not worth arguing. it’s when government officials start using the term conspiracy in proceedings then shit is about to go down.\n\n\nBasically there are myriad anti-influence statutes probably being compared versus all the testimonies and plea agreements and investigations. So they are seeing what may apply and to whether it is of such a degree to warrant charges and prosecution. in general, foreign powers involved in us elections is legally wrong. there was somewhat of a dust up around saudis raising campaign money in the 90s/00s ... but i forget at the moment and too lazy to look. :P'

I don't even care if no wrong doing is found (this would actually be the best case scenario since it wouldn't involve the controversy involved with arresting high ranking officials), because it would still be a vast improvement over the current cloud we have hanging over our heads."

'This constant self-victimization is insane. You are always provoking, trolling, spamming and when you get called out on it you cry about being treated unfairly by people that simply disagree or are sick of the constant bullshit that comes from subs like t_d or conspiracy you play the victim card and cry about how unfairly you are treated. This behaviour is one of the symptoms of an extremely unhealthy discussion culture that comes from both sides, civil discussions with rational arguments are rarely held because one side sprials out of control and either plays the nazi-card, or in your case the victim-card. It drives me insane...\n\nRant over'
'Did you even fucking read the indictment?!\n\nHe MENTIONS tax evasion. There is not one single tax related charge. Anywhere. The tax law felonies required to prove the entire case are not actually charged. Anywhere.\n\nFor that matter, he MENTIONS intent to defraud banks and financial institutions. Where are the bank fraud charges? Nowhere.\n\nIt’s a piss poor, sloppy indictment that embodies the principle (yes, principle) that grand juries will indict literally anything, even a ham sandwich. \n\nUnless he supersedes this indictment with another? This case is hilarious.'
"The man with the tiny hands is such a narcissist, he has decided that since he can't appreciate irony, he is going to ruin it for the rest of us."
'Spite against Comey.  I read Trump’s book once (forgot the title, but it’s the one co-written by the guy that ran Learning Annex), anyway, Trump has an entire chapter on revenge.  If you don’t seek revenge on someone then you’re just a chump.  \n\nHis examples are Martha Stewart who didn’t thank him enough when she hosted her own version of The apprentice (which failed, so that makes her a loser).  The other example was a golfer who used Trump’s practice facilities when he was trying to make the pro tour, and when he did make the pro tour, Trump wanted him to wear Trump apparel and Trump felt rebuffed when the golfer said he needed to talk to his agent.  \n\nNothing motivates Trump more than revenge, which is why some of Trump’s decisions seem to be motivated by no other reason other than Obama was for it.'

'IANAL, but it is my understanding that once you have been pardoned of a crime (“obstruction of justice”, for example) you can then be questioned under oath about your participation in the crime, who you spoke with, who ordered what, etc *without the ability to plead the fifth*. You can’t incriminate yourself of the crime that you have already been convicted of and pardoned for because of double jeopardy, so that line of questioning is fair game. '

"I think it's that Russia isn't a hive mind. It's perfectly reasonable for a representative to tell the truth when asked a question. That's all that this is. It doesn't necessarily mean it's a tactic.\n\n\nAnd I also think Russia has already got what it wanted. It doesn't want the US to destabilize. The world's most powerful military being led by a destabilized government is likely no major nation state's desire. That just makes Russia a target even more.\n\n\nI think Putin just wanted to be taken seriously. I think the Russian people, after a humiliating collapse and then economic depression and embarrassing alcoholic leadership, and *then* geopolitical embarrassments like Iraq, Kosovo, color revolutions... Russia and the Russian people just wanted to be taken seriously so that their threats (like during Iraq and Kosovo) will be taken seriously.\n\n\nI also think the US and the West in general is ludicrously naive sometimes. First of all, the US 100% has more efforts to sway Russian public opinion than *anything* Russia did. Simply, Russia isn't a true democracy so the results aren't as dramatic. And second of all, we all do our best to blame Russia or whoever for the fact that, undeniably, tens of millions of our neighbors and family members intentionally voted for a complete idiot that was caught bragging about sexual harassment on tape. Like anywhere else in the developed world our situation would even be *possible*."
"No your right. And both sides are playing right into they're hands. We need to arrest the corrupt, and prosecute them. But sadly I don't think any politicians will be jailed, besides a handful of trump admins. We need to also Start an actual dialogue with the other side, but its hard when both sides are in hysterics.

'I think that thinking Putin "just wanted to be taken seriously" is ridiculously naive. Russia has goals. Putin has plans.'
'The Russian people didn’t work to undermine our election. Their government did. That sort of rhetoric is a barrier to the fact that people in general don’t hate each other. Governments get belligerent towards each other, politicians amplify the emotions, and people pay the price. It’s just a big geopolitical and financial game to these people. It’s corrupt and negligent.'
'The Russian people are, by all accounts, very supportive of the current regime in Russia. Russia is a sprawling diverse federation of many different communities. Sure, any semblance of dissent is crushed instantly. But if there was widespread dissatisfaction, that system would collapse. Easily.'

If we had, they said, it was hypocritical to criticise Trump’s sins. \n\nThat day, I learned sexual assault is the same level of wrong as watching Deadpool with a beer. '
'The least you need to know: There is a global cold war between authoritarianism and liberalism (small-l). Our president* is on the wrong side.'
'Russia stole Crimea, North Korea wants to  burn America, yet Trump acts like their American allies. Canada your closest ally, 70% of your trade is with Canada, the ones who died along side you in multiple wars, sent powerline technicians to the USA during storms, helped you during 9/11, send our police to March along side fallen police in American cities, the one friendship you should maintain and its all being throw away because you have an idiot at the helm. Trump put tariffs on Canada but wants to save ZTE a Chinese company that broke your laws and so trump can save Chinese citizens their jobs. Trump support Russia by joining G7+1 because why, Russia sent trump a few prostitutes to piss on him lol.\n\nI know this will pass and a new president will eventually occur but for now, get your shit together America! '
'I don’t understand.   Maybe I am getting old.  Why the fuck is the gop so brazenly anti-American?   \n\nCan anyone explain it?  Is it just for payouts from companies ?   Is it that simple and base? '
"We need to get this fucking manbaby traitor out of office. I'm sick of this blatant shit while his supporters and the GOP jerk each other off saying nothing is wrong. PLEASE remember to VOTE. This is not okay. This is not normal. We are better than this."
'Somewhere in California Ronald Regan is rolling over in his grave. Regan did everything he could to defeat the Soviet Union. Now what does the Imbecile-in-Chief want to do? Bring Russia to our shores with open arms.\n\nIt’s sad the Gripper can’t rest in eternal peace.'
'Russia is turning America into what Russia is today, a shithead with no friends. And the bitch ass pussies, the GOP, are letting it happen. '
'Putin hasn’t let go of the Cold War. He’s still fighting it, using #Drumpf to destroy the foundations of our democracy. '
'Those of us with a brain know. Unfortunately, a decent portion of the country are just mindless sheep listening to the fox as it readies them for dinner.'
'We do. We will make this shit right, I believe in that. '
'Some point? They were kicked out because putin annexed Crimea. They don’t deserve to be invited back especially after 2016 and all the countless shit they’ve done before that and after. Putin loves chaos. That’s what he wants. \n\nAt this point anybody denying that trump is putin’s bitch deserves to be ridiculed. The evidence is blatant and abundant. PBS just released a spreadsheet that has over 100 different pieces of the evidence going back to 1988. All connecting trump and Russia. '
'This is guy who wants to ignore all the shit that Russia did, and let them back in. This is a guy who refused to impose the sanctions that the majority of the GOP and he himself signed.'
"Russia started surveilling Trump in the late 1980s, building up a file on him. Because of his marriage to Ivana, who came from a closed Soviet bloc country, and was a rare person who was allowed to travel back and forth to her country, the Czech police state was watching and reporting back to Moscow. Around that time, the Russians re-assessed the profile of the kind of people they look for in espionage against the US. By that time, communism had a very bad reputation, and there weren't any prominent communist idealists in the US to exploit by Russia. Instead, Russia decided that people who had low morals, cheated on their wives, were narcissistic with grandiose ideas, who had problems with money would be the ideal targets to turn against the United States."
"Where's the evidence for this? I always just assumed it was an assumption. I don't trust our leaders when they say anything (nor should you) because of Iraq. The same people who were in charge of planning the Iraq war and putting out fake WMD propaganda are the same people who say things trying to demonize Russia."
'I suspect most of the g7 know what the game is with trump and have numerous intercepts of him talking with Russia. They no doubt have multiple lower level contact points with US government and military and are just waiting for the current trump sized issue to blow over before normal services resumes.'
"Putin:It's sooo hard to find a good puppet these days. If he wasn't just a pussy grabber, I would effectively rule the world, but this dumbass has to cheat on his wife too! Idiots. "
'The president of the USA will have to decide if he will come and give his deposition or fight the court filing by May 29. Furthermore, information from that show will now be offered as evidence to the members of the legal team. Meaning potential exposure of him. Finally, and most critically forgotten. Anything found in a trial of a person can be used in other trials if the prosecutors if they can prove to a judge it is relevant evidence in that other case. This includes criminal and federal cases. '
'It’s hard to be constantly outraged. I already think he’s an awful, awful excuse for a human being. When I see his name in the news I often try and tune it out. It’s Trump...  I doubt he’s done anything new to surprise me...'
'The right insinuates someone not yet charged with a crime of which they are accused is guilty all the time. Time to start playing the same dirty game I say. Fuck this. '
'Not sure about this charge. But there are a lot of bad, bad things about Hillary. She lost the election for many reasons. She was a terrible candidate who did many stupid an/or shady things.\n\nBut she is a grandma in Chappiqua. Not the President in the White House. I don’t care how terrible she is or was. It just isn’t important to my daily life.\n\nOn the other hand the dumpster fire train wreck that is this President does affect me and a lot of the world. That is what this sub is about. Keep it relevant.'
'I’m not rushing in to declare truth on this one, but it’s certainly no hoax. There are two declarations made under penalty of perjury attached to the that complaint, and a licensed lawyer put his signature on it subject to Rule 11. \n\nIf the allegations aren’t true, this is some kind of criminal conspiracy. But you can’t brush off this kind of evidence as a hoax. \n\nOr are you saying the complaint linked above wasn’t actually filed at all? That’d be a proper hoax. '
'What are your views on the O.J. Simpson murder trial?'
'Ah yes, because rape victims NEVER drop the charges out of fear. Especially when they are accusing very powerful people that can destroy their life. Nobody EVER does that...'
'The reason people tend to normalize it is entirely based on the pre- existing knowledge of how much full of shit Trump always has been. There\'s a difference between the shock of the "President of the US" doing these things, but there is no shock with "Trump", as a citizen. But that\'s the contrast we live with until he is gone and people need to understand the difference between the title and the person. We all expect this stuff from Trump, and he should be held to a higher standard. That\'s why the real enemies here are the members of the current GOP. They are to blame for this.  If you put a baby in charge of a job, that\'s on you. Problem is they didnt just put him there, they are actively fighting to keep him there. It\'s inexcusable.'
'He’s a Teh_Dotard poster suggesting we, the enemies of America, have got everything we can get out of the StormyDaniels stunt and are moving on to the next attack on Trump.'
"Who me? I didn't rape a 13 year old. No rapist. You're the rapist. I'm the least rapist of 13 year olds ever. I've raped less 13 year olds than any president in history. Historic folks."
'The lawsuit was a hit piece to cover up the breaking news that was gaining steam (for the second time) in May 2016 that Clinton flew on Lolita Express over 20 times without SS.

'
'How about this: Trump almost definitely pissed on underage hookers, raped a 13 year old, committed some locker room treason amongst other hobbies.'
"True. But she could not have been surprised by that. The electoral college was known, obviously.\n\nBut this is history. I don't care about it now. I am much more concerned with what the president is doing to this country. Lamenting Hillary is a waste of time. It's what the Trumpsters want to dwell on."
"I know a shit load of 13 year olds just dying to get in line to be a witness in a sexual assault case. \n\nThe only way I would believe Trump didn't do this is if he said he did. This guy is the most impressive, prolific liar I've ever seen. "
'"He said that *naggers* annoy him! He\'s very easily annoyed! Astonishingly so!"'
'Nah. I think you’re thinking of privileged material. \n\nSpoliation refers to someone in the Trump camp destroying incriminating evidence so it doesn’t come out in discovery. It’s illegal, of course. But we wouldn’t be in this situation in the first place if the Trump camp was full of rule-followers. '
'"Vote for me and I promise I will kill the people you hate. And don\'t worry. They can\'t touch me."'
'Hey man I am against Trump. But WTF is this shit? '
'Then mods should dump all the folks who post news. Even still there are posts that are in bad taste and this is one. '
'What a dumb post, you’re helping to hurt the credibility we would have and further push the divide '
'I’m not a trump supporter at all, but I gotta point out that even the most innocent men of all can be dumb and egomaniac as shit and also anxious about their public perception/self perception\n\nEdit: I’m not relating to trump with this comment, he totally did what he’s being accused of I mean look at that guy '
'Nah, more likely she has been hiding out until that pesky black eye goes away. Either that or her “kidney procedure” was her taking too many pills and her trying to kill herself. Nothing would surprise me at this point, tbh.'
'You know this subreddit was made for stupid shit right? '

"Trump spends more money golfing than this entire investigation has cost, and it's already produced numerous indictments, guilty pleas, and increasingly evidence of money laundering. Don't gimme that concern trolling about dividing the country. Trump is a criminal and he will be held accountable for his crimes."
"Minus 19 indictments, 5 guilty pleas, and the fact that it's incredibly obvious besides all that. I mean let's think back to when he fired Comey, what did he do immediately following that? I'm paraphrasing, but he said that immense pressure had been taken off of his shoulders, and later bragged about it on national television. \n\nIf you're here on Reddit and you don't see how obvious it is that he's guilty of all that and more, then you are either a troll or you have your head in the sand. "
"Over 19 indictments under a year at a 1/10th the cost of trumps golf trips. Comparatively this investigation has far more results, much quicker and cheaper (magnitudes cheaper) than that stupid ass email investigation into Hilary Clinton.\n\nI'd much rather pay to preserve democracy than float a dictators golfs trips for 10x as much. Fucking obviously.\n\nFinally an investigation with results and the hyper partisan fucks are crying foul, surprising literally no one."
"You couldn't be more wrong.  Trump's golf trips have cost WAY more than this investigation.  Melania living in NYC for the first year cost more than this investigation.  \n\nAnd they have more than nothing, Flynn, Manafort, & Gates have all plead guilty just to name a few.  \n\nThis investigation did not divide this country, Trump's racist views has divided the country.  He gave a legitimacy to people whose views are backwards and wrong.  When he said good people on both sides about Charlottesville, he welcomed racists and bigots.  He, his rhetoric, and his supporters (you) have done more damage to this country than whatever perceived damage Mueller has done. \n\nThe rest of the world thinks we're stupid for electing him, we fucked up bad.  We were the world leaders and Trump has screwed that pooch to the point we're a laughing stock.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

'2 year old account, 3 posts, poor english. I guess all the good russian bots and shills are busy pushing the release the memo bullshit. '
"Of course they won't. If anything, one or two low level employees will maybe get in trouble but that's all. Look at what happened in 2008. One fucking person was charged. One."
"You're not concerned that every last person who would possibly know say the Trump campaign helped Putin steal the US election. I'm not concerned when a couple Republicans, proven liars and cheaters as an entire party, shouts they have secret information they can't tell us that will get Rosenstein fired so they can fire Mueller."
'How is this spying on political opposition?\n\nAre police “spying” on suspects when an overwhelming amount of evidence points to their guilt in a crime?\n\nFollow your logic above through: cops aren’t ever investigating; they are spying. Very odd position to take. '
'Maybe i read it wrong. Wasnt OP questioning the commissions integrity, not deutsche bank?\n\nExit- yea im an idiot. I misread the title and didnt realize the scrutany was aimed at DB.'
"Trolling? There are Congressmen who have read the memo and are sickened by the actions of the Obama administration, FBI, and DOJ. They are saying it's worse than Watergate! If it's true, wouldn't you, not as a Trump hater but as an american, be worried? "
'You missed the word illegal. '
'Republican congressmen. Who have lost ALL credibility since trump took control. They’re all his damn stooges and lackeys and not a single one of them has an ounce of integrity. \n\nI’ll be voting straight ticket D for the first time EVER this November. It makes me sick, but this shit is un-american. The republicans have had a full year to stop it and have chosen not to. '
"How is it illegal for a presidential candidate to collude with the FBI and DOJ to obtain an unverified and fake dossier. Then use that fake dossier to obtain a FISA warrant to illegally spy on your opposition. Then illegally unmask the identities of the people who were illegally spied on. You're right, it's like a cop pulling someone over for speeding. How odd..."
'\n\nIm not sure... In addition the the examples below I will add that CNN, after the election, was caught interviewing a random voter who later was revealed to be their camera man and cutting to a blank screen whenever a guest opposes their narrative.  "Oh no, that sucks".  Below is why they are known as "Clinton News Network" and "Chicken Noodle News". \n\n\n\nCoverage of the 2016 U.S. presidential election\n\nOn April 3, 2016, hundreds of supporters of\xa0Bernie Sanders\xa0protested outside of CNN\xa0Los Angeles. Sanders supporters were protesting\xa0CNN\'s coverage of the\xa02016 United States presidential elections, specifically in regards to the lack of airtime Sanders has received. Known as Occupy CNN, protesters claimed that\xa0major media networks\xa0have intentionally blacked out Sanders\'\xa0presidential campaign\xa0in favor of giving much more airtime to candidates such as\xa0Hillary Clinton.\n\nDonna Brazile and Roland MartinEdit\n\nIn October 2016,\xa0WikiLeaks\xa0published\xa0emailsfrom\xa0John Podesta\xa0which showed CNN contributor\xa0Donna Brazile\xa0passing the questions for a CNN-sponsored debate to the Clinton campaign. In the email, Brazile discussed her concern of Clinton\'s ability to field a question regarding the death penalty. The following day Clinton would receive the question about the death penalty, verbatim from an audience member at the CNN-hosted Town Hall event.[14]\xa0According to a\xa0CNNMoney\xa0investigation, the debate moderator\xa0Roland Martin\xa0of\xa0TV One\xa0"did not deny sharing information with Brazile."CNN severed ties with Brazile on October 14, 2016.\n\nWikileaks emailsEdit\n\nCNN anchor\xa0Chris Cuomo\xa0said on a live coverage of the 2016 elections that downloading the\xa0Podesta emails\xa0from the\xa0Wikileaks\xa0website was illegal, and that only the media could legally do so. The statement drew criticism to the network for being false.\n\nTrump administration coverage\n\nOn January 10, 2017, CNN reported on the existence of classified documents that said Russia had compromising personal and financial information about then President-elect\xa0Donald Trump. CNN did not publish\xa0the dossier, or any specific details of the dossier. Later that day,\xa0BuzzFeed\xa0published the entire 35-page dossier with a disclaimer that it was unverified and "includes some clear errors".\xa0The dossier had been read widely by political and media figures in Washington, and had been sent to multiple other journalists who had declined to publish it as it was unsubstantiated.At a press conference the following day, Trump referred to CNN as\xa0fake news\xa0and refused to take a question from CNN reporter\xa0Jim Acosta.\n\n\n\nOn June 26, 2017, three network investigative journalists; Thomas Frank,\xa0Eric Lichtblau, and Lex Haris, resigned from CNN over a false story, later retracted, that connected\xa0Anthony Scaramucci\xa0to a $10 billion Russian investment fund. The network apologized to Scaramucci and stated that the online story did not meet their\xa0editorial standards.\n\nOn November 6, 2017, CNN ran a story entitled "Trump asks Japan to build cars in the U.S. It already does."\xa0The story included only a partial quote from President Trump stating that he would like Japan (more) to make cars in America. However, CNN originally omitted the remainder of his statement congratulating two Japanese automakers for investing more money in the US to build another factory. The Washington Post took notice and criticized the report.The Post called the headline "snarky," and told the network, and others, to stop "cherry-picking the quote." CNN later changed the quote and the headline, issuing the following correction: "The original version of this article and its headline did not make clear that President Trump had praised Japanese automakers for expanding existing U.S. facilities and for making new investments in the U.S. The article and headline have been updated."\xa0\n\nThe Washington Post again fact-checked a CNN report regarding Trump on December 8, 2017: CNN ran a story that claimed two sources told the network that the Trump campaign received an email that gave Trump and his son Don Jr early access to Wikileaks documents on September 4, 2016. CNN had not obtained the supposed September 4th email. The sender was "Michael J. Erickson", who CNN was not able to contact.\xa0The Washington Post, however, did obtain the email, which showed that the email was actually sent on the day after the hacked documents were released by WikiLeaks--September 14, 2016.\xa0CNN issued a correction their story.\n\nThe network also imposed new rules on Russia related stories being published to social, video, editorial, or MoneyStream without going through the chain of command within CNN.\n\n\nPersian Gulf War\n\nDuring the\xa0Persian Gulf War, CNN was criticized for excessively pushing\xa0human interest stories\xa0and avoiding depictions of violent images; the result of all this being an alleged "propagandistic" presentation of news.\xa0A report by\xa0Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting\xa0(FAIR) quotes an unnamed CNN reporter as describing "the \'sweet beautiful sight\' of bombers taking off from\xa0Saudi Arabia".\n\nCoverage of Iranian protests\n\nIn 2014, the network was criticized for an unusual absence of live coverage of a large set of protests that followed the\xa02014 elections in Iran.\n\nOperation TailwindEdit\n\nIn 1998, CNN, in partnership with sister\xa0Timemagazine, ran a report that\xa0Operation Tailwindin 1970 in Vietnam involved the use of\xa0Saringas to kill a group of\xa0defectors\xa0from the\xa0United States military.\xa0The Pentagon\xa0denied the story. Skeptics deemed it improbable that such an extraordinary and risky\xa0atrocity\xa0could have gone unnoticed at the height of the\xa0Vietnam War\'s unpopularity. CNN, after a two-week inquiry, issued a retraction. The story\'s producers were summarily fired, and one of them has been highly critical of CNN\'s handling of the story, saying that the network bowed to pressure from high-ranking officials to kill the story.\n\n\nJeff Zucker\n\nCNN was criticized for its coverage of the\xa0Boston Marathon bombings, after erroneously reporting that a "dark-skinned male" had been arrested in connection with the attack. In the aftermath of the broadcast,\xa0Jeff Zucker\xa0– who became president of CNN in 2013 – lauded the coverage, claiming that "CNN shined this week",\xa0and boasted ratings success that CNN achieved during the coverage, adding that "viewers respected the network\'s accountability when it admitted its mistakes". Jon Stewart criticized Zucker\'s comments after calling CNN\'s coverage of the\xa0Washington Navy Yard shooting\xa0"breathless wrongness", claiming that "The lesson they take from this is – it doesn\'t matter how much they betray our trust."\n\nFredricka Whitfield\n\nOn June 13, 2015, while discussing the\xa02015 attack on the Dallas police headquarters, host\xa0Fredricka Whitfield\xa0referred to the gunman, James Boulware, as "courageous and brave, if not crazy". The comment received immediate backlash and calls for her to apologize. The next day, Whitfield stated on air that she misspoke and in no way believed the gunman was courageous or brave. After the backlash continued, she issued another on-air apology on June 15, saying she terribly misused those words, now understood how offensive it was and was sincerely sorry.\n\nM.I.A. Interview\n\nIn June 2009, musician\xa0M.I.A.\xa0stated she did an hour-long interview with CNN condemning the mass bombing and\xa0Tamil\xa0civilian fatalities at the hands of Government forces in\xa0Sri Lanka\xa0in 16 weeks the same year, "and they cut it down to one minute and made it about my single\xa0Paper Planes. When I went to the\xa0Grammys, I saw the same reporter from CNN, and I was like, \'Why did you do that?\' And she said, \'Because you used the G-word.\'" "Genocide. I guess you\'re not allowed to say that on CNN"\n\nSteubenville High School rape case coverage\n\nCNN revealed the name of the 16-year-old victim on March 17 by broadcasting unedited footage of one of the convicted rapists\' post-conviction statements. This practice is against the\xa0Associated Pressguidelines for coverage.\n\nMilwaukee riots coverageEdit\n\nDuring the\xa02016 Milwaukee riots, CNN showed a clip of Sylville Smith\'s sister, Sherelle Smith, urging rioters: "Don\'t bring that violence here," and referred to her as calling for peace. The rest of her speech, which was not included in the broadcast, included the following: "Burning down shit ain\'t going to help nobody! Y\'all burning down shit we need in our community. Take that shit to the suburbs! Burn that shit down! We need our weave. I don\'t wear it, but we need it." After being called out for selective editing, a CNN reporter involved in the story tweeted that they had "shorthanded" the quote and posted a link to a corrected video on CNN\'s website, which began with the screen shot that read: "An earlier version of this story mischaracterized what the victim\'s sister was trying to convey. She was calling for peace in her community, urging the protesters to go elsewhere."\n\n\nSome controversy was created by the use of CNN on-air staff for fictionalized reports and broadcasts in the science-fiction movie\xa0Contact.\n\n\n\nIsrael–Gaza conflictEdit\n\nDuring the\xa02014 Gaza conflict, hundreds of protesters came to the\xa0Time Warner Center, where CNN\'s\xa0New York City\xa0production facilities and bureau are housed. Various people accused CNN of biased coverage during live interviews on the network.\n\nSemi-automatic weapons\n\nCNN apologized for a May 15, 2003, story in which CNN\'s\xa0John Zarella\xa0and\xa0Broward County, Florida\xa0Sheriff\xa0Ken Jennedemonstrated the rapid firing of\xa0fully automatic\xa0firearms while covering the federal\xa0Assault Weapons Ban, due to expire the following year. The Assault Weapons Ban was concerned solely with\xa0semi-automatic firearms, not fully automatic ones, which had already been restricted by the\xa0National Firearms Act\xa0of 1934, and the subsequent 1986\xa0Firearm Owners Protection Act.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'

It seems to me that the US is pretty divided right now.\n Also the idea that Trump is playing 4D Chess and purposefully bombed that Syrian airstrip because it was unimportant to the Syrians seems a little silly because  Trump proceeded to carry out missile strikes against Syria  3 more times.\nAlso, Trump has continued to enforce sanctions on Russia\nand the US announced that it would stay fighting against Syria "indefinitely". So "Trump is a Putin puppet" but under Trump The US is in permanent War with one of Russia\'s only allies in the middle East.\n\nI\'m no fan of Trump and I think his shady dealings with the Saudis, Israel and everyone else who put money in his pocket needs to be exposed, but it seems unlikely that he is a Russian spy for god\'s sake.'

'I’ve been wondering if and when we would see the pivot from Russian propaganda.\n\nTheir goal was initially to sow discord, and later it narrowed to focus on the Clinton campaign. They succeeded in the latter, but they’re still trying to do the former. At some point in this clusterfuck of a presidency, they may get more payoff from undermining Trump than supporting him.\n\nWe already got a taste of this with the fake Kushner indictment frenzy on Twitter a few weeks ago. '
'Indicted. No crime has been charged and no conviction. They will never be hauled into court to defend themselves, this way the muh Russia narrative continues by a weak grasping for anything Democrat party. Witch hunt wasting time and money that should be focused elsewhere. '
">The recent indictment has made me realize russian bots are pushing all sides.\n\nRussian propaganda had been *heavily* targeted toward conservatives, and beginning in 2016 it became more focused on its anti-Clinton content.\n\nSome of the supposed targeting of Democratic constituencies seems primarily intended to provoke outrage from conservatives by exploiting their bigotry and paranoia. The Muslim ads are particularly obvious examples.\n\nThere was and continues to be targeting of liberals, but the majority of propaganda efforts are intended to manipulate conservatives. I'll let you draw your own conclusions about the susceptibility of right-wingers to propaganda."

It's far worse, as we already know that Twitter was actively being used as a vehicle for the IRA agit prop by the Russians.

In the heat of the moment, I found it necessary to mix these concepts by attempting to discourage people from having a high opinion of Twitter trends by creating the mental image of a person sticking a gas pump nozzle into their rectum.

'It will simply not trigger a constitution crisis. The president is explicitly able to order the AG to fire the special counsel. A new one will be found if he fires Mueller.\n\nBut they won’t; Mueller is now a weapon for Trump because of the scandals that have cropped up during his tenure as investigator. Trump and the GOP would much rather have him be the one to present evidence of wrongdoing than someone else because they can attack the credibility of the investigation.'

"My hunch is it would not really change the political dynamic here at home. The left will call it out for the smokescreen it is and be outraged that he is risking American lives for a distraction. The Trumpistas will parrot Republican talking points and whine about unpatriotic liberals not supporting the president in wartime.\n\nAt this point, I don't know if it's possible to create a distraction that would change the dynamic and the division. If North Korea attacked us, people would still (with some justification) blame it on Trump. To really change the game there'd need to be something happening to us outside of anyone's control or influence. Giant meteor? \n\nAnother theory might be is it would make it more likely for Republicans to decide they're ready for President Pence. Trump clearly could not handle a high-stakes conflict like that, so they'd need to keep a tight leash on him (which despite Kelly's efforts hasn't been successful) or get him out of the way."

No attorney in the world would let their client speak with the prosecutor- doing otherwise would be tantamount to malpractice or ineffective assistance of counsel. This is fake media drama to fill time until Mueller actually makes his move.

'I\'m not a lawyer, but my understanding is that law enforcement officers like US Marshals have authority over people within the US.  The issue is that there are a few specific exceptions.  There are limited circumstances under which foreign diplomats can be arrested (though there is not "infinite" diplomatic immunity.)  \n\nThe legal question is wether there is some sort of exception for the POTUS when he is refusing a lawful court order such as a properly issued subpoena to testify.\n\nKeep in mind that the Secret Service are just another federal law enforcement agency.  They aren\'t some magic Presidential guard.  They also do stuff like bust currency counterfeiters.

I only kind of see how you get from one point to the other.  I guess the thinking was he could capture an potential audience of tens of millions and then play the aggrieved victim of a "stolen" election on TV till the end of his days.  With his base eating it up and buying Chinese Trump merch.\n\nHow\'d that work out for you, Donald?  Now you\'re in a place you never wanted to be.  Even you have to know you\'re so far in over your head.  Most of the country finds you to be somewhere between an embarrassment and a vile criminal.\n\nThe end result will hopefully be a conviction.  But that\'s exceedingly had to do, no matter the evidence.  The next best result would be the never-ending deep thrust of shame and humiliation that almost anyone would feel when they were exposed, like he will be.  But this isn\'t almost anyone.

'Funny thing about that--means nothing, of course, but I got an overwhelming feeling yesterday that something had shifted, and in a good way.  Cohen has the keys to the safe.\n\nAnyway...to our younger viewers;  every time I open one of these posts, the first reply is always, "But, there\'s so many of them that still believe!"  I\'m an old fart, the first president I remember is Eisenhower, lol.  I grew up with the base, they\'re always going to be there.  That\'s life.  All you can control is yourself.  Have no doubt about it, they may be going about it in an unproductive fashion, and voting for this yokel was about the worst thing they could have done, but they do have a grievance.  Their social class is dying, and we all know it.\n\nRemember, whether you voted for her or not, *Hillary won the popular vote.  We are the majority, not the other way around.  I\'ve seen people shift already--many Americans are kind and smart, and are seeing through this narcissist.*\n\nSo what are our options?  We are going through a social shift-- we can fight them, we can take our ball and bat and go home, or we can stay complacent.  I\'m choosing to fight, but with compassion for those who are disenfranchised and embittered.  But sniffing our own poop doesn\'t help--we aren\'t outnumbered--*we outnumber them.*\n\nHave no illusions, though.  Trump will not go down without a fight, up to and including holing up in the White House after impeachment, and with a warrant for his arrest.  Narcissists do not fold, they\'ll burn the house down first.'

'Even Steve Bannon sees the writing on the wall, idiot. \n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/03/donald-trump-russia-steve-bannon-michael-wolff\n\nBannon has criticised Trump’s decision to fire Comey. In Wolff’s book, obtained by the Guardian ahead of publication from a bookseller in New England, he suggests White House hopes for a quick end to the Mueller investigation are gravely misplaced.\n\n“You realise where this is going,” he is quoted as saying. “This is all about money laundering. Mueller chose [senior prosecutor Andrew] Weissmann first and he is a money-laundering guy. Their path to fucking Trump goes right through Paul Manafort, Don Jr and Jared Kushner … It’s as plain as a hair on your face.”\n\nLast month it was reported that federal prosecutors had subpoenaed records from Deutsche Bank, the German financial institution that has lent hundreds of millions of dollars to the Kushner property empire. Bannon continues: “It goes through Deutsche Bank and all the Kushner shit. The Kushner shit is greasy. They’re going to go right through that. They’re going to roll those two guys up and say play me or trade me.”\n\nScorning apparent White House insouciance, Bannon reaches for a hurricane metaphor: “They’re sitting on a beach trying to stop a Category Five.”'
"you need charges to throw someone in jail. It's not just used for waiting for trial, but also for shorter sentences. That doesn't automatically mean they will get due process. The term prison and jail have been used interchangeably.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison?wprov=sfla1"
'Police station is where you go when you’re arrested. Jail is when you’re sentenced to under 1 year, or awaiting bail.  prison is over 1 year. '

'Well, according [to this article](https://www.dailywritingtips.com/jail-vs-prison/) (which is specifically meant for writers) the two are interchangeable as a colloquialism only.  Meaning that if you don\'t know any better then, by all means, feel free to use it.\n\n>When the words are used in reference to actual places of legal confinement, there is a distinct difference between a jail and a prison.\n\n>In most US states, jails are short-term facilities operated by local authorities, whereas prisons are long-term facilities operated by the state or federal government.\n\n>When people are arrested for anything, from drunk driving to murder, they will be temporarily confined in a jail. For lack of more appropriate facilities, mentally ill people are often placed in jail.\n\nThe article ends with the following admonishment:\n\n>Most speakers will probably continue to use jail informally to mean “a place of incarceration.” ***Professional writers, on the other hand, may be expected to observe a distinction between jail and prison in formal contexts.*** ^(emphasis mine)\n\nPlease keep in mind that the jail/prison differentiation is specific to the US.  If you are in the UK then the meanings are slightly different and jail is spelt "gaol".'

'Which is laughable.  I was in Turkey at Ataturk\'s airport hotel when the coup was happening. (Nothing like tanks shooting helicoptors outside of your hotel to make a vacation memorable.)  For ~8 hours, it was chaos.  Then bureaucratic control clamped down hard and it was slow, miserable, awful.  All this was during Eid, to boot.  It was a shitshow for all the Americans traveling through Istanbul at the time.  Took us four days to get out.  Ugh.\n\nNo, it\'s pretty clear that the "coup" was internally co-opted by Ertogan, used as a publicity stunt, and was way too well coordinated both in its execution and failure to have been done by someone on the other side of the planet.

"It's funny how you say 'I'll base my opinions on facts' and then go into whatever the rest of that was. \n\n> there is no evidence of Russia's impact in our election at all\n\n None except multiple secret meetings that were denied and covered up, thousands of spam accounts originating from companies linked to RT, and heavily biased business interests and associations. \n\nWhat about the part where Jr specifically admitted someone approached claiming to have dirt on hrc, and he went ahead and met with them - but claimed they had no dirt? Doesn't the 1) being approached mean Russian associates might have actually attempted other avenues of undermining our election and 2) show that Jr at least was interested in entertaining such a lead?  If she 'did' have real information, are we to assume DJT Jr would have forwarded that information to the proper federal authorities, or simply walked away from it? "

'If Trump pardoned him it’s pretty much saying collusion and it will draw more attention to Trump.\n\nNot to mention the American public will hurt Republicans this mid term and next presidential race. \n\nEvangelicals and Baptist bases are already pissed about the fact that they’re separating kids from illegal immigrant parents  at the border And without that base the Republicans are nothing.\n\nTrump is a cornered animal and Mueller is about to field dress his ass and gut him alive while he watches it all unfold. Republicans are trying so hard to discredit Mueller but they can’t. \n\nOtherwise, if they could this investigation would be over right now and this sub would be insignificant.'

'the council of evangelical pastors and baptists and the Catholic Church plus the American Pediatrics Association have all opposed separation of family and criticized the administration for doing it pretty much says it all and was the warning shot across the bow for the Trump Administration, that should not be taken lightly because they (the leadership) influence their flock and base.\nYou don’t need polls to figure out that shit. That goes against anyone’s moral compass especially if they have any family values. Real Conservative are not happy about it many have voiced their displeasure and maybe fake ass fiscal conservatives may not care, but the majority of the religious Conservatives sure as hell put Jeff Sessions on the hot seat for misinterpretation of the book of Romans.'
'Does matter at this point who it’s applied to? Republicans are acting like Nazis...they literally retweet Neo Nazis all the time, tear families apart and calling it “biblical “ and letting Jew hating cousin fucking degenerate hillbillies that contribute nothing but hate to society have a voice. \nThey don’t deserve a place in society or “a seat at the American table “ because (as a veteran) I’m very against anyone doing the shit they do for being a Jew, Black, Mexican, Gay, a woman, or whatever. Those that fight them back get a pass because someone has to. Turning a blind eye perpetuates and let’s the hatred fester and unfortunately sometimes you have to put rabid dogs down.\n\nFrom my POV the GOP are a bunch of fucking morons because this is a recipe for a Democratic Super majority in house and senate that could last at least 2 Democratic Commander-in-Chiefs being voted in for the next 2 decades...That could also be just as bad because Democrats are just as bad at fucking up (look at Debbie Wasserman Schultz and how she screwed Sanders out of being the nominee) ....

'Why is this comment being downvoted? I think fullofwind is right. The FBI could’ve charged Trump with something by now but they want to build the whole case and charge the guy at the top by the fullest extent of the law.\n\nIf there was treason and/or deleriction of duty involved then THAT should go into  Congressional record.\n\nBut yes if he’s out of office he gets little to no chance to further damage the US and the world. Things are delicate as it is and we are inching toward war here with the recent nerve agent attack. We really need to be asking tough questions about deleriction of duty if not conspiracy.'
'Yes you have a point about crimes against the state and criminal proceedings, but this is not a criminal proceeding (minus the legal hot water Cohen could be in with the FEC and potentially the Bar)'
'First of all it’s not just consensual sex, an affair is classed as adultery in the state of New York, where Trump was a resident at the time. \n\nSecondly Trump used his lawyer to set up an illegal LLC in Delaware 11 days before the election, specifically to pay a porn star hush money so she wouldn’t announce that they had an affair. He broke numerous laws by doing this, so it’s not about the affair, it’s about the illegality of his actions after the affair. '
"Then you won't mind admitting he puts a penis in his mouth and sucks on it and then swallows cum, right? I mean, only a Russian would be bothered by typing such a crazy ass lie on social media, right? Go ahead. Say it..."
'I never defended Clinton you dumb shit, whats your point here? This is where you fall to pieces, see. You think i shoudl defend him, but i dont, where does that leave you? It leaves you exposed as a partisan. THATS IT.  You expect others to be hypocrites because YOU ARE A HYPOCRITE. the problem is, i just made you look like a fucking fool and made you expose it for everyone to see, Good job you stupid little man. \n\nYou make this shit so easy. How does it feel to have me control you through the internet?'
'The mob also gets their lawyers arrested. Which... in this case... I guess means Cohen’s lawyer is also gonna busted for something? Man, that’d be a hell of a thing.'
'Trump just ruins lives. He destroyed that doctors life this week without even trying to. '
'I was under the impression that this was the reason they wrapped up the civil dispute with the other woman (apologies for not remembering her name) - something along the lines of, you NEVER want to have a civil and criminal case open at the same time, since the civil case can be used against you. Apologies if I am interpreting this wrong.'
'Well he either entered into that NDA with trumps knowledge therefore proving the scandal or he did it without trumps knowledge which is illegal '
"Nah, Hicks has half a brain. Don't go all Stockholm Syndrome on me. She's a big girl, she could have left anytime. Melania I'm eh about. She's in a lose-lose situation, but it's also of her own choosing. The only person I really feel bad for here is Barron. Poor kid didn't choose his parents. He's going to need lots of therapy."
'Also, some defendants get very anxious or are terrible at speaking, which could be misconstrued as indicatin guilt by a jury. The 5th keeps that from happening as even the most innocent of people can get nervous or jumpy when being grilled by an experienced prosecutor.'
"That's a Miranda warning, based on the 5th Amendment but it's not the 5th Amendment. If you're being arrested then you're already on the criminal side of things, not civil.\n\nThe actual 5th Amendment is pretty clear:\n\n> No person... shall be compelled **in any criminal case** to be a witness against himself"
"IANAL, but I don't think the 5th applies to only to criminal charges or even pending charges.  You can plead the fifth to civil charges as well.  And it has nothing to do with whether charges are pending or not... say you're called to testify in a trial, and you're not the defendant.  Some lawyer asks you a question that would force you to admit to a crime... even though you're not on trial, and no charges are pending, you still have the right to plead the fifth and not incriminate yourself.  This keeps you from having to perjure yourself."

'Well, wondering about the well\\-being of our First Lady is apparently "vicious," so it\'s best not to ask questions.\n\nTweet from Trump:  “The Fake News Media has been so unfair, and vicious, to my wife and our great First Lady, Melania. During her recovery from surgery they reported everything from near death, to facelift, to left the W.H. (and me) for N.Y. or Virginia, to abuse. All Fake, she is doing really well!” '
'A long time when accompanied with broken bones or at high forced. It took over a month for my bruises to go away when I broke my finger and when I broke my collar bone.'
"Well then you're ~~in the wrong sub~~ on the wrong website."
'Not so sure I agree... clearly this is a partisan witch hunt constructed by the republican centrists to make Donald Trump look bad and get him out of office. As a registered Democrat I am absolutely appalled. '
'Where was the FBI’s motivation to act when they knew about the pulse night club shooter? Or the Florida high school gunman? None, because it pushed the liberal gun control agenda. But OH IF TRUMP HAS EVIDENCE OF BANGING A PORN STAR, better no knock raid him! Yeah, the FBI is totally a non politically motivated entity. The fact he’s hated by both sides of the establishment should be a wake up call to anyone that understands the rot infesting our government, and the one man in our lifetime who can do something about it is being attacked at all costs by those who want to keep their power to rape this nation’s constitution. '
"Trump is objectively a whiny bitch. For a grown ass man with a lot of personal flaws, that should be an unacceptable final straw for any supporter. It's unacceptable in a 12 year old much less someone claiming to be the President of the United States."
"If it works, it just proves how ridiculously incompetent the Dems are at politics. The House has closed their investigation, finding no wrongdoing. The Senate has refused to advance legislation protecting Mueller from Trump's reach, etc. \n\nThey can't backpedal away from that unless the Dems let them. \n"
'Did you just say that Trump being hated on by both sides, [which is not true in the slightest,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-are-coming-home-to-trump/) points out how bad *other* people are? Is that not ironic? The FBI members you were just talking about have been appointed by Trump himself, *according to a Republican.* Is it not sketchy in the slightest that Trump is hating on the only group of people who can prove his innocence? They investigated the Clinton emails right before the election date, so that didn’t help them push their evil liberal narrative.\n\nI find this argument to be a red herring. The massive agencies failure to look at some mass shootings in one area does not mean that people who investigate politicians suddenly have less of a leg to stand on.\n\nAlso, if Trump got kicked out of office, they will replace him with Pence, so I don’t understand why the 🅱️eep state would want to bother with him in the first place. After all, his presidency is causing a Democratic Tea-Party which has been ripping through safe-Republican districts for quite a while now.'
'Oh no, he watches other channels too so he can be enraged at how unfair they are to him.'
'Sure, I\'ll elaborate\n\n"the one man in our lifetime who can do something about it"\n\nHAW HAW HAW HAW\n\n"to rape this nation’s constitution"\n\nTrump is the one who has harshly criticized the Constitution, calling it \'very unfair\'.  AFTER he swore an oath to uphold it.\n\nSo once more,   HAW HAW HAW HAW\n'
'People have been convicted and admitted guilt. \n\nSaying nothing has been found is an outright lie and idiotic at this point.\n\nHow many criminal investigations do you know of that openly share all their info with the world before pressing charges?'
"Trump and his supporters are the worst snowflakes by far.  \n\nThey point fingers and aim blame every which way, but cannot tolerate the slightest criticism or discomfort, which sets them whining like a bunch of baby bitches and crying 'unfair'."
'Considering the cop has just cause to pull him over in the first place, his “investigation” is still limited to that vehicle. What the Mueller team is doing is akin to that cop then getting a warrant and busting down the offenders door to find something else to get him for, since pot is just a misdemeanor. In either case, which crime did Trump commit that started the investigation?'
"And Trump says he was unaware of the payment. If that's the case, which I doubt,  Cohen made a major ethics violation and at minimum will lose his license to practice law. \n\nThere's no positive spin with this for team Trump. "
"The history of 20th century authoritarianism parallels the rise of non-print media. I'm not aware of any historian who makes a direct connection, but World War Two was fueled in part by the rise of electronic media.\n\nAnd it happened fast."
'Stop calling them trolls. They\'re not trolls. They\'re hostile foreign agents.\n\nIf the Soviets during the Cold War were dropping propaganda leaflets meant to destabilize our democracy from airplanes, we sure as fuck would not be calling them "trolls".'

'I had a realization the other day while I was driving home from work that shook me to the core. Right now, Russopublicans are spreading America\'s asscheeks for the Russians. Today, the Russians are winning and times are easy for them to do with our republic what they want. So, let\'s say we vote the bums out in November. (That is *IF* they even let us vote, *IF* the voting machines aren\'t hacked *IF* Trump and his minions decide to obey the rule of law for once and step down, *IF* there isn\'t a "national emergency that makes us have to temporarily delay transition to Dems"... IF IF IF. Even after we win allllll of those... do we have any reason to believe the Russians will just take their ball and go home? Did they do that when they hacked Ukraine\'s power grid **twice**? Nope. Even *IF* we can get the Russothuglicans out, we **still** have war with Russia to fight. '
'The world does nothing. The Russians are waging war on civilisation and the US govt, the UK govt, the EU does absolutely diddly\\-squat about it. Unplug the fuckers now. Why do we need to have these assholes connected to the www at all?'

'> black duster jacket with Nazi, communist, fascist and religious symbols\n\nAlthough it sounds like it was a suicide attempt.\n\n> There was information "contained in journals on his computer and his cell phone that he said that not only did he want to commit the shooting, but he wanted to commit suicide after the shooting," Abbott said. "As you probably know, he gave himself up and admitted at the time he didn\'t have the courage to commit the suicide, that he wanted to take his own life earlier," Abbott said.'
"Dead wrong. Both the Russians and the willfully ignorant are to blame. To say it is *just* americas fault is as stupid a comment as you paint Americans in general to be. The majority of Americans see through the bullshit, didn't vote for the cheetoh, and don't support any of his stupidity. The willfully ignorant are the minority, led by an even smaller minority of the top 1%.\n\nIf someone stupid starts a fire falling asleep with a lit cigarette, they are responsible for the fire. If someone else walks by and throws gasoline on that fire, they are responsible for arson. The willfully ignorant in the US are responsible for their bigotry and violence. Russia is responsible for fueling that fire of stupidity and hate."
"As an American who left the states years ago and is currently back for a visit for the first time in 5 years I can confirm: Americans are uniquely stupid.  I've been trying to wrap my head around it for awhile and I just can't figure it out.  Is it the schools?  It's not just that we're dumb but we're arrogant about it!  And super sensitive when people  point out our faults.  I really don't have a good answer.  Im not trying to hate on every American, I am one, but we cannot deny that something has gone  horribly wrong and it's been this way for awhile.  We should be ashamed of our national ignorance, because we can't deny it.  -being back here and seeing my home the way it is is a nightmare.  "
"I know you're getting down votes, but you're not completely wrong.  \n\nThe ignorance of a large group is being exploited by preying on their weaknesses... \n\nSome are like characters in Idiocracy who vote for the guy because of his insults.  Others vote out of xenophobic response because they're scared of foreign cultures changing the world they grew up in.\n\nThe Right wants to keep you dumb (colleges are ridiculously expensive now), they want to keep you broke (look at loan rates and benefits for the poor) and they want to keep you scared.  It's what gives them power.\n\nIgnorance is a mainstay of their platform and it happens to work.  Russia simply exploited data to drive wedges between specific groups in certain areas to get juust enough advantage to get a compromised person in the highest seat to the point they could lower pressure on their own country through a variety of means while weakening America and dividing us.\n\nIt's working.  Even with Mueller, they're getting what they want.  Greater division in the US.\n\n"
"This shit wouldn't have been effective anywhere except the united states of fucking idiots. It's your own fault. "
"All american people are to blame for allowing willful ignorance to flourish. You know it. I know it. The entire world knows it.

My only regret is not getting as involved earlier than I did. \n\nLumping all Americans together is one of the major problems we are trying overcome towards other countries. You are exhibiting the same nastiness you're accusing all Americans of.\n\nThere are plenty of Americans who have a lot to answer for. But there are millions more who march, demonstrate, and vote. Reasonable people are waking up and becoming vocal more every day. Whatever you are trying to accomplish here is misguided and serves no purpose but to ruffle feathers. "
'This says that the Russians are employing propaganda in the Eastern Bloc...\n\nNo. Shit. Sherlock. '
'> Why the hell are you here bagging on Americans?\n\nWhy do you think, genius? '
"You're obviously not getting it, so I'll make it really brief. \n\n\nYou can't just blame Russia for this. It's your fault too. The only reason these propaganda techniques work on americans is because you're a nation of idiots. If you weren't a nation of idiots, these techniques would be ineffective.

"I want to hear from some Republicans who are still running for office say the same thing. It's very easy to hear from the retired or retiring; I need to hear from someone who puts their country above their interests. \n\nI think most of the Republican officeholders who are not compromised themselves are as horrified as we are. Unfortunately, they have rationalized that if they speak out, they won't get re-elected and therefore won't be able to do anything about it.\n\nIt's craven cowardice and will be remembered going forward.\n\nSome will claim that the Democrats, in a similar position, would do the same. It's possible, but we have had nothing like this before in the history of the republic, with the possible exception of the fall of parties during the Jackson Administration and just before the Civil War. This doesn't bode well for the future survival of the GOP."

'I\'m from the UK, and so I have a slightly different perspective on things. I have a pretty terrible opinion of the Clintons. I also think Trump is a rubbish president. So to me, all of this Whataboutery is irrelevant because I hold them both in disregard. \n\nThe way I see it, if you get caught shooting somebody in the face, shouting "That guy over there is a rapist" doesn\'t make you any less of a murderer. In any case, Hilary is not the President, Trump is and should be held accountable for his behaviour. He certainly appears to be acting helluva guilty so I say let the investigation run its course and see what the outcome is.'
'You’re creating a false equivalency here.  The Clinton investigation, was one point.  The dreaded evil server from which she was storing classified information.  That’s it.  It was a simple question of did she intentionally mishandle data on a personal server.  And the resounding answer from the FBI and the inspector generals report of the investigation of the investigation is a hard NO.  If you’re that worried about Hillary releasing classified data, why aren’t you protesting Trump when he in person told Russian ambassadors about an Israeli spy, releasing classified information and burning an intelligence asset in one conversation.  \n\nWith the Trump  investigation, it’s a web of stuff each in its own right bigger than the entire Clinton server scandal.  Each point of the Trump investigation, in a typical presidency, would have garnered its own special counsel investigation.  \n\nManafort and Gates, regardless of the crimes they have committed and been indicted for, and in Gates case, pleaded guilty to, Trump hired two unregistered foreign agents to run his campaign.  \n\nFlynn, also an unregistered foreign agent that was hatching a plan to kidnap a Turkish refugee and ship him back to his pal Erdogan.  \n\nTrump Jr, his own son.  Setting meetings with Russian Assets for the express purpose of getting dirt on Hillary.  And also, meeting with some other bad actors from the Middle East offering help on a disinformation campaign.  \n\nKushner, his own son in law, taking meetings in his official capacity with bankers, that just so happened to bail his ass out with a few hundred million in Loans.  Also he met with a Russian ambassador seeking a back channel to the Russians.  \n\nOr Michael Cohen, his personal lawyer.  That set up a consulting company weeks before the election and starting accepting bribes, I mean consulting fees, to give “insights” into the Trunp administration on Healthcare, telecom, and aerospace.  Cause his years of being a two bit lawyer and Taxi operator has given him experience in this.  \n\nVanderzwaan, some Dutch banker.  That just so happens to be married to an Oligarchs daughter.  The same oligarch that owns Alfa bank.  The same Alfa bank that was communicating via a private server in Trump Tower.  99% of that servers traffic was made up of Alfa Bank and Betsy Devos’ husbands company.  You remember our friend Betsy? Our education secretary? \n\nSpeaking of Betsy, her Brother Erik Price, mercenary Guy. Well he had a meeting in the Seychelles with a Russian with the purpose of setting up a back channel to Putin.  The president doesn’t need a back channel.  He has a specific phone directly linked to the Kremlin, anytime he needs to check in.  \n\nAny single one of these chance encounters or friendly chats is a bigger issue than whatever Hillary did on her email server.  \n'
'It’s not helpful, even trump supporters have a right to give an opinion on how their country is run.. I am British, and voted remain in an 80% leave area. That wasn’t just Russian influence, although that played its part in the overall result, and while I completely disagree with the reasoning if you do not look at why the dissatisfaction you end up with division and conflict. I would like my country run exactly to my political agenda in a chickenbrew utopia, but that’s not to everyone else’s needs.. don’t close your ears no matter how wrong you think people are.\n\nEdit: I just dipped in the_donald, they’re proper racist loons in there, don’t listen to them., they’re like the bloke at my local pub, racist kev, but on speed and acid, and with guns!!

'Stopped reading after being accused of being a Trump supporter. I voted for Bernie you vapid cunt.  '
"We already discussed your inability to read.\n\nYou know, based on your complete inability to admit you were wrong, I wouldn't be surprised if you're a lying sack of shit about that too. See how that works? \n\nOr you can just start by admitting, yes. Trump did commit a crime.\n\n"
"Yeah, didn't think so. One glance at your history shows you wouldn't have voted for Bernie over Trump in a million years. \n\nYeah, YOU would vote for an avowed socialist. \nFuck off, you lying cunt. \n"
'Did he or did he not commit a crime you dumb fuck? Say it. Or you know, keep being a little bitch.'
"Lol, You actually physically can't bring yourself to ever admit you were wrong, can you? You know, you conservative fucktards never surprise me. \n\nCowards to the core. Every last one of you. \n\nHow fragile does your ego have to be to have someone shove it in your face and you still can't admit you're wrong? What are you, five? "
"If that's the case, maybe the system is fucked. "
'Donald could shoot RBG and really stack the deck, based on this nonsensical interpretation.  Hell, he could shoot all the Democratic SC Justices, plus Mueller and Rosenstein,  Clinton, Comey, and every journalist and brown person he sees.  \n\nThis "government" *needs* to be crippled.\n\n'

'Trump picked Kavanaugh because he is scared to death of Mueller and Cohen.  Period.  The Grand Old Pedophiles and The Predator In Chief can all go to hell.  '
"The rules need to be changed. If theres proof that the president is a murderer you mean we can't change the rules to make it so that the president can be indicted? Because leaving it as is would be RIDICULOUS. The president is a criminal, and they're aiding and abetting. "
"Maybe, but I've read plenty of strongly left leaning opinion pieces that say the same thing.  I'm no lawyer, so I can't be certain.\n\nIn any case with 5 conservative justices any SC case regarding Trump will have to be bullet proof.  I doubt Mueller would take the risk.  All he really has to do is issue a report to Congress with all the damning evidence lined up.  Well and prosecute all of Trump's cronies too.  Can't forget them."
"This would be a bad thing for Trump, arguably worse than not being pardoned. At least if he's not pardoned he can work a legal battle to avoid state level charges (which the NY AG will undoubtedly pursue) because accepting a pardon is legally considered the same as confirming guilt for whatever crimes were committed. As a pardon only cleanses federal charges, guilt on the state level for anything which might also be applicable at the state level would be an issue, especially as being pardoned (iirc) would disallow you from being able to plead the fifth. "
">I doubt Mueller would take the risk.\n\nI'm not sure I see what the risk is? Like, what does Mueller stand to lose if he tries to indict the president?"
"What an absolute moron. He's a global laughingstock! Hey, Donnie, I can shout, too! I WILL LITERALLY SHIT ON YOUR GRAVE, YOU RACIST PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!"
"The terrifying thing is, that this reminder was necessary. But this article isn't any harder to believe than some of the other stuff we've seen recently. Strange times indeed. "

'The DNC refused to give the FBI the \nservers.  You have no proof either...this is what Im saying. This story is bullshit. Trump IS ALOT of things, incompetent isnt one.'
"Okay so, the DNC controls the FBI... Only after the election? They refused to give their servers to their own people they control?\n\nNow that they aren't in power, they still control the FBI(despite refusing to cooperate with the FBI) and are going after Trump? You see how insane this sounds? "
"This is fucking wrong info and you morons keep spreading it. When the FBI investigators look at a system they make an exact copy of that system and use that. They keep backups of backups so shit doesn't get erased or compromised. This is normal procedure in an investigation like this. \n\nSo no, they didn't take the servers because they got the evidence they needed without taking the physical server. All they needed was a copy of everything on those servers.\n\n\n"
'Wow some people are just f’n stupid and shouldn’t be allowed to reproduce. The very real Russian meddling has been proven and anyone who tries to cover it up should be charged with treason. When did so many Americans fall in love with the enemy? Russia and Nazis are bad the Americans are supposed to be the good guy but have now elected Putin’s puppet. Any president who uses the term fake news DOESN’T have its citizens best interests at heart, he’s a self promoting arrogant racist who’s most likely under Russian control '
"Who gives a shit about authors and understaffers\n\nMueller is a dickless coward if he won't go after Trump.\n\nCUCK.  That's what Mueller is.  Until he goes after the big man - he's just another CUCK sitting back watching as Trump fucks our beautiful country."
"It would be really nice to not have to consider Russia an enemy be default...\n\nBut that isn't going to be possible while that evil cunt Putin and his ilk still draw breath..."
'you are ignorant about how this shit works. settle down and have a juicebox. '
"Yes and no.  If Trump and the Republicans keep destroying the Red State economies, there's a point at which even in their desperation to buy deeper into their fantasy, the cult simply won't be able to afford it."
'The craziest thing about it, is that my res actually showed him get +9. All his top comments were anti-trump. And yet his recent posts in were pretty much flaming bullshit.

"I hate to say it but as someone who took care of his parent with Alzheimer's the last years of his life, there are parellels here that are not being unnoticed by some.\nFred Trump passed away at around 93 years of age, suffering from Dementia brought on by Alzheimer's. Apparently according to most news sources, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's around 8 years before at the age of 84/85. But back in the day, the onset of Alzheimer's was not noticeable as it was not studied as much, the onset of dementia is the final phase but even longer before that, it manifests itself with changes in personality in that its victims become impatient, are more argumentative and seem to be more closed minded about their opinions. Sound Familiar?\n\nI watched this in my father over the years and before that my grandmother, so I am at risk, and I take it seriously, hoping that recent science advances may cure this disease. I was tested recently and was classified as not having the gene that promotes this, however it's not known if the genes is a classic indicator of the disease or just coincidental.\n\nI do not think Trump has Alzheimer's, at this time, but he may have some precursors, that I am sure others are looking at to. It might not manifest itself in someone who is in his early 70's, but the initial personality changes can happen at this time.\n\nWith all the fal-der-all with the only two physicians to actually examine him, may be another bullet point. Doctors have a confidentiality oath to their patients, but Trump has a known history of punishing and awarding those who have intimate knowledge of his weaknesses.\n\nIn his last two years of his Presidency, Ronald Reagan was identified with Alzheimer after the fact, and in his last year, it had gotten so bad that there were days were he was not cognizant of where he actually was, according to Nancy Reagan. This leads me to believe there may be more and more professionals looking at his behavior and his decision making process at this time under stress.The problem is, is that his behavior, while boorish, is not anywhere near being close to dementia or an early onset Alzheimers, so we may see the end game her processed by an very stubborn person whose behavior no one can explain."

"A candidate can spend his own money. Ross Perot spent a fortune of his own money. It's not a violation.\n\nNone of the indictments have anything to do with collusion.

I think this is what he meant when he said he wanted Comey to investigate the issue with respect to his campaign.\n\nIt's your version that has no basis in reality.\n\nWe are all waiting for the smoking gun but it's clear from those questions that were leaked there is no smoking gun."

There's no law saying a politician needs to release this and the American people didn't care since they voted for him.\n\nThe reason this is a witch hunt is because normally.\n\nAn investigation is into a specific crime looking for a perpetrator.\n\nThis is an investigation into a specific person looking for a crime.\n\nIt's a massive abuse of the justice and political system and when Mueller finally is forced to the supreme Court to get his subpoena this will all be exposed."

'Too bad for him, there\'s no "bitch" running in 2020....If he makes it to 2020.'
"The law isn't clear at all on the point. What you're saying has always been the assumption, with the key argument being that a criminal case will be too distracting to the President. However, the long dragged out impeachments (ref. Clinton) - especially as it hampers Congress too - goes counter to this argument. For this reason many want to challenge that principle and have it tried before the courts."
'I used to get mad, but now I just feel sorry for people like this. Clearly so many things had to have gone wrong for someone to end up this clueless. And this is exactly why the GOP are actively sabotaging public education: they don’t want critical thinkers. They want people who go their entire lives without pulling back the curtain on people like Trump. Just take in the bullshit and never question it.

"Democrats blew their wad with Hillary. Unless they pull another Obama out of their ass, the 2020 election isn't looking too good for them right now"
'Attack the argument, not the character.'
"Mmm, no. Had the Bill Clinton case been brought into the criminal courts the courts would probably have dealt with the case far more leniently that Congress did. It was a political circus, and there was no way the Republicans would have allowed the criminal courts to take the lead.\n\nHere we're seeing the opposite. The crimes (if proven) are very serious crimes, and Congress doesn't want to pursue it for political reasons."
'This investigation is heating up real quick. The media will go into a frenzy. I predict that Trump will have meltdown at the height of this investigation leading to his resignation. Either Kushner or Donald Jr will go jail, maybe both. The GOP will suffer heavy losses in the Mid-Terms. I think Russia will face some serious retaliation by the US and EU. 2018 will be one hell of a year.\n\nI also want to point out that comments are being downvoted.

'Reminder: The Manafort and Gates indictments have no relation to Trump or the Trump campaign.

"Yeah it would have been awkward to keep them on after they flubbed colluding.  It's a bad look. "
"If there's evidence they're guilty of something, sure.\n\nI don't think you Redcaps get the point here. We (aka Real Americans) aren't treating this like a game. If a conspiracy to undermine American democracy was carried out, we want the people involved to face justice. We don't give a shit if they were right or left, if they worked for the RNC or DNC - if they betrayed the country, they should be in prison. That's what The_Mueller's working for, and if it involves the Podestas then great!\n\nIt just so happens that the Republican Party has essentially become a front for a criminal organization, so it seems a lot more likely that indictments are headed for that camp. But if they (or rather the rest of them) don't - no skin off my nose. I just want the criminals behind bars."
'And?  That won\'t stop the investigation.  Or absolve any crimes committed by the Trump administration.  It just adds a few Dem scalps to Mueller\'s pile.\n\nAnd just a reminder.  Clinton was impeached over perjury about a blowjob.  That Special Counsel was investigating a land deal from a decade before he became President.  \n\nAs long as all these politicians haven\'t done anything or lied in the last 20 years they\'ll be safe.  But if they "forgot" something on a government form somewhere, established a quid pro quo with a foreign agent or took laundered money, they\'ll be going to prison.  I expect that Rob Mueller will be far more thorough and impartial than Ken Starr ever was.'
'You will find the brains of that victory in Moscow. Trump is a fooking Moron. His only possibility of not being guilty is that he is too much of a Moron to even understand what is happening to him.'
"Dude, what kool-aid are you drinking?\n\nTwo people got arrested today for their ties to Russia. Manafort was Trump's campaign chairman, and Gates was his deputy. A third indictment was unsealed and said Papadopoulous was a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign who repeatedly tried to set up meetings between Trump and Putin. Papadopoulos plead guilty months ago.\n\nIn what world does high-ranking Trump campaign officials getting arrested for taking Russian bribes, trying to set up Trump-Putin meetings and lying to the FBI about it connect them with Clinton?"

"Libs have been praying that **President Trump** would fire Mueller, and he will not. There is no evidence of collusion between the campaign and the Russians to influence the outcome of the election. There is however ample evidence of liberals in government breaking the law in an attempt to frame the President, in an attempt to overturn the results of an election. When do we get our country back ? How do we recover for the damages of liberal lies and conspiracy theories ? I bet we never even get an apology. Next will come renewed calls for impeachment, not because there is any legal reason, just because liberals hate democracy. Liberals can't stand not being able to order others around. They don't care about the truth, the law, or the rights of their fellow citizens.\n\nLiberals are very bad and dangerous people."

"I'll compromise here. I'll take George W. as president for life over Donald Trump for the rest of this term. It has nothing to do with politics. Donald Trump is not the person for this job period. He is dangerously stupid and loud mouthed. It is an objective fact that he blabbed intel to people he should not have blabed it to, his lawyers hate him because he says things constantly to make his situation worse. He is bad at his job, thats why we want him gone. No one wants to overturn an election. Impeachment doesn't mean we revert to hillary being president. This comes down to whether or not people can face facts that Donny is no good at this. Plugging your ears and pretending it isn't happening isn't helping our country. Leave everything else alone and you still have this fact: Donald can't do the job properly. He has to go. "
'Holding classified documents on a private server is a crime, and if it isn\'t, then it should be. Don\'t forget about the purge of their emails.\n\nhttps://www.factcheck.org/2016/09/the-fbi-files-on-clintons-emails/\n\n>FBI Director James Comey on July 5 announced that although Clinton and her staff were “extremely careless” in handling classified information, the FBI did not find evidence that their actions were intentional. He declined to pursue criminal charges.\n\nA bit further down:\n\n>It turned out that Keilar’s assumption was accurate. The 31,830 personal emails that Keilar asked about were deleted “sometime between March 25-31, 2015,” according to the FBI. That was about three weeks after Clinton received a House subpoena on March 4, 2015.\n\nLooking at these and the rest of the events surrounding her emails, it is very clear that she was hiding something. Hillary is not squeaky clean like you are trying to say she is. Even just being "extremely careless" with handling classified information shows incompetence, and do you really think she is dumb enough to have honestly made that mistake?'

'I think Trump gives new meaning to the saying, "Fuck bitches, get money."'
"You're right but the law does care. These are possible campaign finance violations. Trump may very well he prosecuted for these different payments, even if the prosecution is after he leaves office. "
'He hasn’t been wrong on anything that he stated as definite that I recall.  He was also making a big point on talk shows of explicitly saying he’s never been wrong and I’ve never heard any of the hosts contradict him even when they sometimes looked irritated at his arrogance. FWIW.'

'Stupid is what stupid does, right?'
"He actually isn't, and people are downvoting him because of his name. He is saying that Broidy had a vasectomy in 2010. You know, the guy tied to the alleged affair and payoff. Since he had a vasectomy it would be difficult for Broidy to get someone pregnant but since Trump has never had one he is probably the guilty party."

There is no recording of the conversation, so we have to take Dodson's word for it. Eric Trump denied he said any of it. \nI believe Dodson but I thought everyone should know the full details."
"Really unfortunate this wasn't recorded. But considering how specific these quotes are, it would be very hard for them to claim that it was taken out of context. That whole family needs to be branded for the traitors they are."
'Well turns out the quotes are reversed which will just be used to discredit it. I understand that may not matter much to most of us here but it’s important to be factual. All the other side would have to say is it’s wrong, it’s fake news they never said that. '
"From the [original NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/19/us/politics/trump-jr-saudi-uae-nader-prince-zamel.html):\n\n>It is illegal for foreign governments or individuals to be involved in American elections, and it is unclear what — if any — direct assistance Saudi Arabia and the Emirates may have provided. But two people familiar with the meetings said that **Trump campaign officials did not appear bothered by the idea of cooperation with foreigners.**\n\nThis will be the story of the demise of this presidency, and possibly Trump Org as well. It's laws about money laundering, bribery, corruption, campaign finance, elections: he thinks everyone breaks them routinely, so he'd be a sucker to give them a second thought. \n\nWhen he was a private citizen, he got away with it. We don't have the resources to prosecute them, so they are de-facto legal. When you're the president, suddenly your behavior goes under a microscope, and the jig is up."
">Countries other than Russia may have offered assistance to the Trump campaign.\n\nFinally, a president willing to stand up to the globalists.  Could the projection get any more pathetic?  At what point are they going to blame Democrats for them voting for Trump?  Because at this point it's inevitable.  These people don't just lack a conscience.  They lack shame as well."
"Unstable genius. Whoopsie. Trump has heard that Trump did something bad. Does the fact he refers to himself like that not signal that he's as cuckoo as hell ? Hello ? \n"
"They already are blaming the Democrat/deep state conspiracy for the Trump campaign's collusion w Russia."

'Multiple important things to take away.  \n\nNumber 1 this was done by OPR which is not part of the FBI but rather the DOJ WHICH is under Sessions.  \n2 McCabe believes he was targeted and smeared to loss credibility as a witness in Mueller s probe\n\nThis is incredibly petty to fire the man 18 months after the incident at 10 pm 2 days prior to his retirement. '
"I'm just glad they fired him instead of strangling him or poisoning him with either a nerve gas or polonium laced tea. "
"Or, maybe (maybe), he just sucked at his job? I don't know. I mean, getting cash for his wife's political career or ignoring clearly broken laws by a 'former candidate who shall not be named' or failing to followup on rules that were bent, broken or dismissed altogether because said law breaker had the same political leanings. No. Probably not. It must have been because he knows something about the Russians. Or, he could just be a douche nozzle that nobody liked. So hard to make sense of this. "
'Sessions bears a lot of the responsibility for this. Then again maybe his job was threatened if he didn’t fire him.  '
'FAKE NEWS: OPR (Office of Professional Responsibility) is part of the FBI, OPR is basically the FBI’s own internal affairs. But, yes if you are part of the FBI you are under the DOJ, there’s no hidng that one!\n\nYou also failed to mention the findings of the Obama appointed OIG inspector.'
'INAL, but would he really have a case? I know what the administration did was shitty and i am no trump fan. But what could McCabe sue for?'
"Dude, Trump didn't fire him. It is a little ridiculous getting down votes for stating something that is clearly fact based. Don't just ignore McCabe's nonsense because you dislike Trump. The guy was fired based on the findings of the Congressional Committee which had nothing to do with Trump. "
"I mean, clearly the AG or FBI Director could fire McCabe at any time.  The President has lambasted McCabe MANY times on Twitter.  At least in the eyes of the POTUS, there was ample reason to fire the guy months ago.  I just don't see why it had to wait until a politicized report was released by the HIC to do it.  The actions taken by Sessions and the White House just scream vindictiveness.  And now because of this, McCabe will sue the government for wrongful termination, costing taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more in legal fees.  From what I understand, McCain will eventually get a pension, but it won't be for another 10 years, and it's only ~$60k a year.  That's $600k in lost income for him.  How much will the federal government have to spend in legal fees defending their actions on firing him? "
'The publicly available document? \n\nWhoever fired him (not Trump according to you) had sufficient security clearance to access the House Intel findings long before the sanitized report became available.\n\nSo #logic: this guy is a major fraud, totally compromised, a disservice to the country, a black mark on the agency, a fool, a traitor...\n\nand we’ll hang on to him for awhile longer?'
'The House Intelligence Committee took a vote on whether to read the actual documents on which they claimed to base their “report.” Democrats voted for reading the documents. Republican majority voted against — the majority’s failure to read the underlying documents meant they knew nothing of the subject matter of their “report.” The screed that the Republican majority provided was basically a list of vague resentments based on lies, written by a moron who has no idea what he’s doing, besides carrying Trump’s jockstrap.  Google is your friend, too.'
'And? Does this in any way mean Trump fired McCabe? No, or doesn’t. '

'There are court dates already on the docket next Wednesday and Thursday so the plea deal could be made public as soon as the 21st and more indictments could drop on Manafort as soon as the 23rd.

'Ok so.  My questions is, if there was no collusion or any witting cooperation between the campaign and russia, how did popodopolous know that russians had dirt on Clinton? Also, how will it work if Mr. pop is the only person that knew (as an example)  Is it like crime on t he streets where if someone in your organization does someting wrong youre guilty too?'
"Nah bro. If we did that we wouldn't be the United States anymore. We fought a war for that. Twice. "
'You all stopped being scary a while ago when we found out how competent the Trump administration is.  Now I feel bad for you.  '
"Manafort's already lied, misled, and otherwise fucked around with Mueller's team since he got swept up in this. He's not useful as a witness, they're gonna throw the book at him.\n\nWith any luck he wont see the outside of a federal pen as long as he lives.\n"
'Manafort is a big fish but not the one Mueller really wants. Being the chairman of Trump’s campaign put him in a unique position to see **everything** that happened during the campaign. Manafort is going to prison that’s for sure but Mueller will and likely has offered him a lifeline keeping him from serving the rest of his life in prison. '
"They're not saying the sarcastic jokey parts I put like all of Trump's advisers being being somehow employed by Hillary Clinton, but they are saying the first 2 sentences.  When they post here, they post something similar to that too.  They've got posts up right now saying Mueller is somehow working on the Uranium One deal and going after Clinton.  I don't have the strength to make this shit up anymore."
'I reported ya, you shit for brains bot. BAM! We all should. Come on, for America!'
'It’s total bullshit. \n\nImpeachment is in the Constitution. No one is above the law. All civil officers can be impeached and removed from office by the Senate. Anyone who argues otherwise is a moron or a criminal. \n\nI repeat, moron or a criminal. '
"Just to be clear:\n\n1. Kavanaugh said that it *is not* currently the law that the president is exempt from criminal investigation/prosecution/questioning, and that Congressional action would be necessary to change that. It would be very hard for a justice who said that to later find such an exemption without congressional action.\n\n\n2. Impeachment is completely separate from criminal prosecution, which the constitution says come *after* impeachment. I would very much like to see 45 prosecuted, but Kavanaugh (and the constitution) have a point here: in theory, you need your president to be presidenting, and a criminal prosecution is distracting. The answer isn't supposed to be that he gets off, the answer is supposed to be that he gets impeached at the first whiff of criminality. Obviously, McConnel and Ryan have fucked this up, but the principle makes sense to me."
'That would make him above the law. Commit murder one year into your term? Congress won’t impeach because the investigation is “tainted”? Get re-elected ang go 7 years without standing trial for murder. That’s what being above the law looks like. '
'>I do find it amusing that he wrote that essentially defending Clinton. Saying that investigation distracted him from running the country.\nAnd some are taking it as him being a trump supporter/defender.  That’s not really the case at all.\n\nNo. He wrote that in 2009, after Bush and Cheney have been subject to controversy. Contrary his subsequent call for the exemption of the president in criminal investigations, he was in a lead role in Starr’s Clinton probe, and took an aggressive approach in investigating him. He also spearheaded the investigation into Vince Foster’s suicide and its connection to Clintons, which was basically the Seth Rich conspiracy theory of the 1990s. He drafted the Starr report, though he objected to the release of some sexual details.\n\n> kavanuagh is a moderate,\n\nJust no.'
"I understand the concern but his track record shows a record of using a lot of case law.  Now him being up for this position is also a bit scandalous.  It's coming out that Kennedy would only retire if he was given the job.  This whole thing is fucked.    This seat should have been the previous administrations at least one of them.  However I do believe that all political and personal bias do not belong in courts conservative or liberal which is why it only being 51 for appointment is bad now.\n\nI think he could've gotten the job on the old standard but this is now super political and ramifications towards a constitutional crisis.    not be allowed to appoint and the McConnell rule should be in affect since we are so close to midterms which if the democrats were smart would sue over this because it essentially became law after 2016."
'There is an investigation during an impeachment trial. For the sake of argument if  a POTUS was going through the impeachment trial for criminal misconduct wouldn\'t that count as a "criminal investigation"? I think the term "criminal investigation" needs to be defined.  Given that the term isn\'t well defined by this nominee (from what I\'ve seen posted here), I\'m not sure how you find this sensical. '
"Um, no dude. Kavanaugh is not saying the president cannot be impeached. No one with any knowledge of separation of powers jurisprudence would make that argument. He's saying the president is immune to criminal indictments while in office - which is not, for the record, a new or radical idea."
'“An impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.” Gerald Ford.\n\nThe Constitution specifies two crimes, treason & bribery, by name but also leaves room for a much broader interpretation — one that’s been used before to impeach other elected members with “charges” of abuse of power (which in & of itself is not a crime, legally speaking) or champerty, which is almost like sportsmanship during trial. A judge in the late 1800’s (Mark Delahay) was even impeached because of drunkenness. Now I highly doubt a congress would ever impeach a president over any of these, but going back to Ford’s statement - impeachment is political, it’s not judicial. If Congress wants to lodge charges of impeachment against a sitting president, theoretically it could be about anything.'
'That\'s exactly why his position is strange. He wanted to be aggressive in investigating Clinton to the point that Ken Starr rejected some of his proposed questions (he also injected some of his personal opinions on Clinton\'s behavior in his letter to Starr, which Republicans will all be howling and whining about if Mueller\'s team or anyone involved in Trump\'s legal troubles did so on Trump) yet ten years later, he thinks such aggressive approach distracts the president from carrying out his job to the fullest of his abilities and is therefore bad. Either, over the decade, he experienced a massive change in his views "with no political bias involved" or he had been worried about possible probe into Bush/Cheney as he worked for Bush. \n\nAnd about being moderate: he is more right-wing than Kennedy and Roberts, so that should be a dealbreaker as to why he is no friend to liberals.'
'I agree with the thought, but then there is this:\n\nKavanaugh wrote in an article for the Minnesota Law Review from 2009 that Congress should pass a law “exempting a President—while in office—from criminal prosecution and investigation, including from questioning by criminal prosecutors or defense counsel.”\n\n“I believe that the President should be excused from some of the burdens of ordinary citizenship while serving in office,” Kavanaugh wrote. “We should not burden a sitting President with civil suits, criminal investigations, or criminal prosecutions.” Furthermore, Kavanaugh opined that the “indictment and trial of a sitting President” would “cripple the federal government.”\n\nSo, he’s not only immune from indictments - he’s immune from investigation. How can someone be impeached for misconduct if they cannot even be investigated for said misconduct? One begets the other. \n\nWhile you are right that he is literally saying “indictment not impeachment” should be illegal, you’re kidding yourself if you think this doesn’t have the same effect. \n\nHe chose Kavanaugh to protect him from the investigation, full stop. This is a very great risk that could shut down Mueller. '
"I think the concern here, at least for me, is that this nominee seems to be concerned with the preservation of the executive powers at all costs, even in the face of grave criminal misconduct. While I believe that a judge is suppose to render decisions based on precedence, traditional practice, and the facts, we have seen other SCOTUS' rule to the contrary, Neil Gorsuch, being the most recent in his vote to overturn decades of precedence in the recent Union ruling.  I think we also have to remember this current nominee worked in the Bush administration during the most controversial time when the executive was violating privacy and human rights laws (I'm of course simplifying here), but to my knowledge he was a staunch supporter of those aforementioned Bush policies which I too find troubling. "
'Read it again. *Criminal* investigation.\n\nEdit: for clarity, think of it this way - if you take the stance that the president is immune from criminal indictment, of course he is also immune from criminal investigation with an eye  toward indictment. What would be the point of a criminal investigation of an unindictable person?\n'
'He was doing his job... it wasent his job to only investigate a little bit because his personal opinion was “this is distracting the president”.  Wouldn’t you be upset if Mueller did that now? “I’m distracting trump so I won’t push the investigation”?\n\nTbh, I have no respect at all for them to just oppose everything because trump did it.  Same as I think it was absolutely disgraceful when congress refused to even consider any justice Obama nominated.   These things should be done properly, on a one by one basis, based on the nominated persons credentials.  Not by party line bullshit. \n\nThis is why we have a dysfunctional government. And it’s just as incredibly irritating when the dems do it. '

'Here you go.\n\n*1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism*\nDJT:  While we don’t have Swastikas everywhere we look, we can look almost anywhere and see one specific slogan: Make America Great Again. This slogan that Trump created represents harmful beliefs.\n\nThis shows extreme nationalism and a want to unify people under a symbolic slogan.\n\nWe can see the slogan on hats, shirts, signs, and more apparel, and it’s only a way of spreading nationalistic beliefs and hate.\n\n\n*2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights*\n\nThere is absolutely no argument that this point doesn’t align with Trump. He has managed to convince many people that certain groups such as Muslims and Mexicans are enemies, and we need security against them. He’s convinced people that certain human rights aren’t necessary (such as basically any right that doesn’t directly help the white middle-class). Also, he convinces people that death penalties and longer incarcerations are okay and even needed. He literally fits into every part of number 2.\n\n*3.

Rampant Sexism*\n\nDJT:  I mean this one is a bit too easy between between “grab ‘em by the pussy”, saying he’d date his daughter if he weren’t related to her, banning funding or any programs that so much as mention abortion, looking down on and encouraging hate towards homosexuality, and many other instances of blatant sexism.  Then for fun throw in how about how he views others:\n"26,000 unreported sexual assaults in the military, and only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together.".....so rape is an eventuality when you put men and women together?!?!?\n\n*6. Controlled Mass Media*\n\nDJT:  Asserts that any negative news is fake news, wants press credentials pulled, wants limited access for press unless authorized, and controls a direct line of propaganda through Hanity and Fox.\n"The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC and @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!"\n\n*7. Obsession With National Security*\n\nDJT:  Fear has been Trump’s tactic since the start. By using the slogan “Make America Great Again” he’s convinced people that America must get better or horrible things will happen, as well as using a fear of minority groups to light fires under racists.\n"I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words."\nEssentially holds children being separated from their parents as a bargaining chip to get his wall built.  A wall that will curb only a small amount of illegal immigration and cost exorbitant amounts of money to build and maintain.\n\n*8. Religion and government are intertwined*\n\nDJT:  You have multiple cabinet members citing Bible verses as to why and how certain policies are enforced.  That is not what this country was founded on!\n"I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created."  \nHe outwardly claims that he’s a Christian, and has used religious beliefs in making his decisions and statements which carries a powerful following.  Which is sad since his actions, and statements are anything but Christian. \n\n*9. Corporate power is protected.*\n\nDJT:  It is all about money and greed.  As President he remains interwoven in private business interests and indeed profits from the Presidency.\nTrump being a business aristocrat, is what put him into office. He is the business/government relationship and he creates the power elite.\n\n*10. Labor power is suppressed.*\n\nDJT:  Haven\'t seen him specifically attack labor Unions as President but has a history of doing so in the private business world. \n\n*11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts*\n\nDJT:  "It is not \'freedom of the press\' when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want, even if it is completely false!"\nThen sue them for libel....oh that\'s right you would lose because a majority of what they are writing about you that upsets him so, is true.\nHe doesn\'t read books, he can\'t sit through briefings, doesn\'t prepare for meetings, and he is proud of that fact.......\n\n*12. Obsession With Crime and Punishment*\n\nDJT:  "If Chicago doesn\'t fix the horrible "carnage" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 42 percent from 2016), I will send in the feds!"\nFast to tweet about crimes that fit his cabinet optics and painfully silent or late to report those that don\'t. \n\n*13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption*\n\nDJT:  This needs its own post, but Mueller investigation, Cohen corruption and bribery, blatant abuse of his so called charity. \n\n*14. Fraudulent Elections*\n\nDJT:  Lies about vote tallies (when it is proven he lost the popular vote.  Lies about illegal voting numbers claiming it is in the millions when it is not even in the hundreds.  Members of his team are being indicted and jailed for working with a foreign government to influence our elections.\n\n'

'The watergate investigation lasted twice as long and the bill clinton investigation lasted four times as long. Also this investigation has not only produced many idictments but also multiple guilty pleas so theres far from no evidence. Ignoring all of this, lack of publicly known evidence does not mean there is none. The FBI does not release any evidence until they are ready to conclude the investigation. This investigation is very obviously not over yet so they are keeping their cards close to their chest.'

'Would he though? I think he’d be all in on Red Scare v2.0. Or is it more likely he’d be fondling Trumps balls and fingering his butthole, while Nunes hums Hail to the Chief with his mouth full? I’m really undecided on this one... Thoughts?'
"I'm not surprised. The Communist Chinese had practically turned the US into a sock-puppet before Trump came along. Kushner had always seemed like a weak link in the administration's armor.

'Trump might well be a genius.  Hide his unbelievable horrific lies with just regular old shocking lies.'
'Lawyers HATE him'
"What are you expecting to find in his tax returns? Are you just hoping for any reason to impeach him because you have trump derangement syndrome? If Trump is a criminal, then the Clintons are demons!! Talking about grabbing a pu$$y doesn't compare to raping dozens of women and appointing judges in districts where you commit crimes to cover for you or flying on the lolita Express over 20 times with convicted Pedo Jeffrey Epstein and very obviously abusing underage girls. And no, the one girl you're thinking of that claimed that Trump sexually harassed her dropped the case. She admitted she was lying so she could get money from Trump to shut her up. Be objective about morality, not just looking for a reason to criminalize someone just because you don't like them. Atleast have a shred of evidence to believe he's criminal first! "
'It would be too much work to find it since the key words are so commonly used.\n\nAfter the election Trump ditches the media to have a family meal and the press lost their shit and condemned him for disrespecting the media and a lack of transparency and so on and so fourth.\n\nEdit: haha I found it.

'Now fox and foes are retreating back to "Trump may have committed some minor crimes, but that\'s all ok because it\'s just part of aggressive entrepreneurship" and "the fbi is just threatening him and making confess to something he didn\'t do".  Do you remember a few months ago (some still repeat this) when trumpites were defending the notion that trump didnt know papadapolous or etc... I think that the fbi is aware that if they indict everyone slow enough, the trumpites will eventually retreat to "ok, he might be a puppet for putin and guilty of treason, but he did it out of the kindness of his heart, oh and the deep state and killary doesn\'t want you to...."  '
'The article has an important error: "He has also been indicted for lying to the FBI". \n\nNo, Papadopoulos wasn\'t indicted, he pleaded guilty. In other words, he\'s a convicted felon. '

I know many people with potential for cum laude that went anti-feminist, flat earthers, anti-infrastructure, conspiracy theorists etc. Like, almost half, and definitely one-third of intelligent people i know have believes that contradict each others (like how Erdogan's a good boy while Trump's evil fucker).

What Republicans CAN'T do is support this system for a good decade and a half, keep renewing the PATRIOT Act over and over, which has enabled these courts to behave in this manner, and then cry foul when one of their own becomes a surveillance target due to his illegal ties (ie Carter Page).\n\nThe Fast and Furious issue was with the ATF, which is a completely different department than anything that has to do with this, so what do I think?

Trump is a racist conman, but he knows how to speak to the gullible racist in all of us. Trump's propaganda works not only on his supporters but also on the media and his opposition.  He gives both sides red meat, and like hungry predators, the news media, his supporters and his opposition continually fall for his shiny objects. \n\nI have empathy for all sides involved, but lament that democrats are not as aggressive or effective as the GOP at voter suppression, because as dug in as Trump voters are, they are by no means the majority, and this reign of terror would not be possible without getting people who believe in democracy to stay home."

'So how long has McCabe been sitting on this evidence? Was he just waiting to be fired to use it as retaliation?'
"Gave his wife money for her campaign run in local politics while McCabe made sure ahead of time to violate no ethics rules. People in Democratic and Republican parties give money to the campaigns of other members of their party. McCabe made sure to follow the rules. Lots of Republicans in influential positions gave to Trump's campaign. So did Russia, which is so much worse, because they're a hostile foreign government. It sucks to be wrong but you gotta come back man - Donald Trump is a traitor to America who is using fascist tactics to confuse you. You're confused and angry, but that doesn't make you right. You're being played dude, you're not being an American patriot. You're being manipulated into supporting treason."

"Wait are you agreeing with me or disagreeing with me? You do know political contributions / lobbying is legal in America right? Shouldn't be, but it is. This is the DNC supporting the DNC, which isn't nearly as shady as say a gun lobby or a prescription lobby. A hostile foreign country doing this is called treason.\n\nTreason - the crime of betraying one's country, especially by attempting to kill the sovereign or overthrow the government.\n\nTrump is beholden to Russia, he won because of working with Russia and he is clearly fulfilling his end of the bargain by defending them in so many ways that hurt America. Just gonna suck when your children and their children are ashamed of where you stood on this. Not too late for ya man. "
'And judging by your comment history you have shitty critical thinking skills as well.'
'Apologies for trying to shame man, I get heated. Look, America has done what Russia has done a hundred times, influenced elections, established our preferred rulers, undermined democracies with disinformation campaigns. From the LA Times: \n\n"The U.S. has a long history of attempting to influence presidential elections in other countries – it\'s done so as many as 81 times between 1946 and 2000, according to a database amassed by political scientist Dov Levin of Carnegie Mellon University.\nThat number doesn\'t include military coups and regime change efforts following the election of candidates the U.S. didn\'t like, notably those in Iran, Guatemala and Chile. Nor does it include general assistance with the electoral process, such as election monitoring."\n\nI don\'t think this is right, but I\'m an American patriot, I love this country. But when Russia does this to us, fuck them and fuck their puppet. Trump is a traitor to my country.'
"Exactly. But that's us doing it to another country, which as an American I far prefer to goddamn Russia doing it to us. I'm a Republican, I don't like Hillary, she's shady as hell, I didn't vote for either of them, I think the fact she screwed Bernie so bad is an assault on our democracy too. But that doesn't discount that Russia did this shit to us. Hillary is irrelevant and a distraction to the fact Trump is Russia's bitch, and when an American president is Russia's bitch, he should go to jail for treason. Hell maybe I'm wrong tho the facts make it overwhelmingly seem like I understand this, but at least first let us look into it thoroughly shall we? Let's make sure we're not being forced to be Russia's little bitch. "
'Yeah, there’s already ample public evidence of shady Kushner shenanigans.\nHe asked the Russians if they could set up a freakin’ [secure communication](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-ambassador-told-moscow-that-kushner-wanted-secret-communications-channel-with-kremlin/2017/05/26/520a14b4-422d-11e7-9869-bac8b446820a_story.html) with the Kremlin (preferably in the Russians embassy) during *the transition*, FFS. \nThat was too much, even for the Russians!'
"How do you expect to get the full scope of communications between family members subpeonaed without invading the family's personal devices? So you'd have to do that. And that's a slippery slope.\n\nDo I hate Trump? Yes. Does that mean Mueller can issue a blanket order to view all his personal familial communications with his children without prior evidence of criminal guilt?\n\nHell no. That's absurd. That's why this order is obviously not between him and one of his own children. It just would make no sense.\n\nBesides, Sam Numberg already spilled the beans: it's him. So this is a moot point."
"I don't trust President Pinocchio at all. He tells lies daily and he has no credibility. He has been a con man all his life and that will never change."
"I don't think he's gonna try and fire Mueller. Even his dumbass knows that would be a mistake."
'You see,  I don’t think that Mueller is in danger of being fired, since Rod Rosenstein doesn’t see any reason to fire him. The problem is casting doubt on the investigation, since Trump has a propaganda arm in right wing media. How effective this is also depends on how Mueller’s agents conduct themselves, and also on how people perceive Trump, which could change given the new tax bill'
'That depends if Firing Mueller is less harmful than keeping him he will fire him and take the hit. \n\n\nA cop turning off his camera is very suspicious and will get them in trouble. But if they know the camera will get them in more trouble they will turn it off.'
'Your analysis assumes a ration thinking person\'s way of handling this. We all know how this is going to go down. Or at least this is how I see it going down. Mueller investigation make major headline (maybe Kushner indictment or bannon), likely later in the week. Trump has a meeting with someone on Friday with someone that says firing Mueller is a good idea (I assume to "stall things"). He\'s outside of his time around normal adults (if you can call them that), and he starts stewing. First at how much Mueller is in the news instead of his tweet. He keeps reflecting on what _________ said. And in a short-sighted, off the cuff decision, he\'ll call Rosenstein to end the investigation (not fire Mueller, but to end the investigation). He\'ll refuse, and Trump will be offended and fire him. Demanding the next underling that steps into the position fire Mueller immediately.\n\nHow things go down from there is what we all are waiting with bated breath to figure out.'

For this reason I believe that not clearly marking articles as “satire” is causing a problem. I believe there are too many joke articles masquerading as real news and fooling people who aren’t skeptical or internet-savvy. (For those of you who are not Americans in the sub, these satirical news articles somehow fool many Americans and are causing problems in our society. Mostly because they all have a partisan slant and are designed to fire up those who already have strong feelings.) \nEveryone’s getting salty about this, but I still think what I’m trying to describe is a legitimate problem currently in our country.\n(And no I don’t watch Rick & Morty, it’s even worse, I do not have a television.)'

It was clearly a hoax, but some people are not skeptical enough to see through a hoax presented earnestly.)'

"Wikipedia ≠ United States Government.

There is an enormous amount of discussion about the campaign in the emails, and subsequent actions and admissions by other DNC officials bear out not just their internal problems but positioning in the campaign. Where it all went off the rails is when Hillary's campaign took over - and in their desperation accepted/took over the sponsorship (i.e. started to pay for) the 'opposition research' that became the 'dossier.' Glenn Simpson's testimony (if he can be believed) was that they 'researched' Donald Trump via publicly available data while he was just one of the potential candidates. It's a little murky on which Republicans revved up the muckraking, but now known that the DNC was the last patrons of this work. The evidence of what a colossal shit show it has become is vary obvious; the 'evidence' that Donald Trump has committed any crime is what is absent."

'Okay, so now there’s 100% chance he knowingly committed a crime in regards to campaign laws. So that’s tied up! That alone is impeachable! \n\nI guess he also cheated on his wife? Does that matter to the GOP? '
'Maddow mentioned this was leaked by the Trump legal team to potentially cripple Cohen’s bargaining leverage with prosecutors for a cooperative deal.  \n\nRecorded calls are likely the most valuable evidence Cohen would have to offer in exchange for leniency, if Trump’s team can release them to the public they become a worthless offer from Cohen.\n\nAdditional bonus: It’s a Tre45on-Gate distraction for the media & public.\n\nIt’s pretty sad that they have to use a recorded call by their imminently indicted attorney proving a hush payment to a Playboy model, likely in violation of campaign election finance laws, to distract from their ongoing collusion, conspiracy & capitulation with a hostile foreign adversary with the whole world watching.\n\nWe’ve already become desensitized to caging children.\n\nWhat a fucking abject embarrassment.'
'I don’t know about you guys but I always sort comments by new. I get the worst out of the way before I get to the good ones later on. If you try it out, you can actually see propaganda happening. Every fourth comment is a super-‘ragtime right winger making a near-identical point. '
"Regardless of if there are tapes, even if there are, Trumpists WILL NOT believe anything coming out of anyone's mouth besides Trump himself.  You are not dealing with rational, critical thinkers here.  If he did pay people hush money, corporations do this all the time in court, I doubt this will be a thing.  I think the only way this becomes a thing is if he used campaign funds to pay for it and knowing Trump and how cheap he is, may have happened."
'Michael Cohen is like Saul Goodman. The quote from Breaking Bad where he says “When the going gets tough you don’t want a criminal lawyer, you want a *criminal* lawyer!” comes to mind. '

'This is exactly what this sub seems to forget.  Nothing that is shown here is going to make Trumpists fall off the wagon.  When he said that he could kill someone on 5th Ave, he was serious and when thinking critically about what can harm Trump, you\'ve got to open your eyes.  The democrats WILL NOT win in 2020 by spewing Russiagate all over the place.  \n\nTrump beat the most well oiled, organized and highly paid political machine we have ever seen in 2016 with being a complete idiot, having many, many flaws and making "mistakes" that would kill normal political campaigns on a daily basis.  Do NOT take this guy lightly, however much people hate him, he has a really big chance of winning again.'
'They will make deals with the devil to get what they want.  '
"Right now it isn't even a crime, just subject to civil enforcement by the FEC, which (If it ever got around to it) would be a fine. I am not sure when it would be subject to criminal prosecution, but I think it might be if there is evidence Drumpf knowingly directed the payment. In general, prosecution is rare - the last high-profile case I can think of is that of John Edwards."
'**Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act**\n\nThe Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, commonly referred to as the RICO Act or simply RICO, is a United States federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization. The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering and allows the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes they ordered others to do or assisted them in doing, closing a perceived loophole that allowed a person who instructed someone else to, for example, murder, to be exempt from the trial because they did not actually commit the crime personally.RICO was enacted by section 901(a) of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 (Pub.L. 91–452, 84 Stat. 922, enacted October 15, 1970) and is codified at 18 U.S.C. ch. 96 as 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'
"This source is the worst. Even if this story pans out, it shouldn't be from this source."

'He never signed and the contract is already broken because people know about it, because it was leaked from Trump side.'
"It's a garbage source. Kind of a drudge for overeager wishful leftists.\n\nI say this as a bleeding heart moderate who fucks with trumpists on the daily. Palmer report is so bad it could be a right wing operation created to discredit the left."
"It seems as if the whole of reddit wants someone to digest it and just split it down the middle.  Good / Bad.  I am liberal as fuck, but I am also a gun nut. (ironically currently not holding any heat).  I know guns are bad, but fuck if I don't think there are things out there worse and not in my interest.  Guns is a scapegoat for the many other things that are wrong.  Totally not my main point, or maybe it is...  I feel as if people just want one thing, and if they get that one thing, they don't care about the rest of it regardless of its disadvantages. People have political tunnel vision instead of recognizing our leaders are not representing us in the  slightest except for a few senators in vermont and oregon, possibly hawaii.  I literally thing 90% of govt is on the take and cashing out on the rest of us.  My future has already been sold from where I am looking from.  We fucked friends... Fucked."
'I can only imagine people defending this with the "six degrees of separation" theory but failing to talk about the fact these people aren\'t once-met acquaintances, but recurring associates.'
"See? No direct connection. Only speculation, crooked Hillary had more contacts with Putin than Trump does!\n\n- The Right, probably\n\n\n\nSeriously this has gotten beyond stupid. Speculation torpedos liberals and verifiable evidence isn't enough to try a Republican. \n"
"We're probably going to need to dumb this visual down a bit so Trump can understand why he's going to prison. "
"Yup. For a bunch of conspiracy nuts their doing a great job ignoring a huge one right in front of them. Seriously this is the kind of shit they'd be going absolutely crazy about if it was the democrats. They'd be making shit up and blowing every little tweet, conversation, etc out of the water. But their republican group has russian ties of all things and nothing? Wow."
'"As a well known liar, I can\'t imagine the concept of other people lying to me.". \n\n--Donald "Ironically Hypocritical" Trump, national embarrassment'
"LOL.  Second time I've said this today.  Fuck Evangelicals.  They are utterly useless to the country.  They are a blight on progress.  They have nothing to offer but thoughts and prayers.  I have no respect for them.  I am very much looking forward to watching their pathetic version of religion turn to ash as millenials continue to refuse their archaic, useless worldview.  "
'I really thought Trump would turn off the evangelicals back in 2016 just because of his terrible character that is in no way christian-like (let alone christ-like). \n\nBoy was I mistaken.'
'Trump is not a pastor\n\nHe does good and he does bad. Hes immoral sure but hes supported for the good things hes done.\n\nTax Reform\nNorth Korea\nJobs\nEconomy\n\nHere’s a question.\nIf Trump is impeached, How do you think Christians are gonna be with a bold Christian Pence running things???\n\nLogic goes out the window here.\n\nAs immoral as Trump is as a person, his run as a president is viewed well among republicans.\n\nAt this point instead of taking shots of your false perceptions of Christians. Why dont you just say christians are the enemy or you hate christianity?'
'Easy, he’s a scumbag who sold out. '
'Voter suppression’s a bitch, though.  As awful as Trump is, incumbents tend to get re-elected.  His victory isn’t a certainty, but it wouldn’t be weird if he won.'
"It is not a matter of who is or isn't but trump brags about it and parades it around. No man that the Christian religion supports should act in this manner. It is the exact opposite of a Christian. Now lets not even begin to get into the investigation or anything else that shows how dirty he could be. This is purely off his personality. This man has several sexual assault allegations and has paid hush money to porn stars. Trying to persuade anyone to think that Christians have a reason to vote for him due to their values is just hypocrisy. "
"People who do less harm than good.  This isn't quantum physics, and you can compare immoral actions *quantitatively*.  A person who failed to observe proper protocols checking their email is not on the same level of morality as one who has probably fucked their own daughter.  \n\nYour attempt at false equivalency here betrays a willful intention to deceive, because if everyone is immoral, then immorality in ANY form shouldn't bother you, and therefore you wouldn't have put it on your fucking list in the first place."
'Let\'s hypothesize, for a fucking second, that the answer to your idiot rhetorical whataboutist bullshit excuse for a question was "nothing".  Do you stupidly believe that this somehow transfers blame from the people destroying our constitution onto the backs of those who dare to mention it?  \n\nNow, to the idiotic and asinine assumption we started with:  Pointing out evil is already "doing something" to stop it, as is voting, campaigning, and arguing with dumbshit apologists wherever one can find them. '
'You should google "just asking questions".  It will answer the question you are "just asking".\n\nAs a *fucking rule*, any time you are tempted to spend your time JAQing off, you should instead type those questions into google and spend your time *reading the fucking answers*.  That\'s time which you owe everyone else before you can expect to stroll into a new place firing off idiot bullshit.'
"Every paragraph:  about me personally. \n\nLook at that everyone.  It's incredible. \n\nThese people think investigating someone along with many others means attacking the investigation itself is needed and an equal response.  \n\nAlways attacking the messenger..."
"It's a systemic issue that as it happens often and over and over in other jurisdictions will change the shape of the voting public. \n\nA small amount adds up when the change is replicated elsewhere. Especially when you consider the times retirees vs. working class people vote and who they vote for. Over time, these small changes add up and eventually we end up with parameters so skewed it takes judicial intervention to rectify it. \n\nLook at district lines in heavily gerrymandered states.\n\n\nAnother way they are disenfranchising people is by reducing staff at polling sites in lower income areas. While on it's surface you might think the same as you did here, but, if you have a shitty job and your boss gives you a hard time about voting, you'll be less likely to stand and wait in a long line to vote.  Less staff equates to longer lines, and thus the purpose of disenfranchising voters is served. "
"Who would Jesus hate?  How did Jesus feel about moneylenders in the temple?  Going further back, what's the Bible's position on adultery?  On coveting?  On idolatry? On giving succour to the poor and disenfranchised?  On lying?  On throwing stones? "
'I did not came here firing off idiot bullshit! I came asking question to you because you had different opinions. I didn\' say "you\'re stupid because of this and this...". No, I asked you people why did you think that way and to support it with more thought, and your response was to behave like little offended scout girls. Geez! Sick of this tribalism everywhere, things were never like this...'
"It's a technique developed by lames. When they feel themselves losing, they have to rely on personal attacks, it's the trait of weak men just like their orange leader. What he needs is therapy cause his insecurities are projecting at theatrical levels 😂"
"If Trump is subpoena'd to appear before a grand jury, can he just plead the 5th to everything, or refuse to answer questions? \n\nIs it a given that his lawyers will not be present? \n\nWhat is to stop him from just telling Mueller to fuck off? Trump has ignored so many protocols so far, what will stop him from just refusing to appear if subpoenaed. "
"If he gets interviewed it would be a felony to lie, oath or no oath.\n\nThey will probably already know the answers to most of the questions they ask. If he tells the truth he's fucked and if he lies he's fucked. He's fucked."
'How can you be impeached but not removed from office? \n\nWhy was he impeached again? For lying to the Americans people about cheating, or the act of cheating itself. Cause Trump has topped all of that and nobody gives a shit...'
'Worst case scenario is Trump just does time after his term ends.'
'You’re not alone. Basically first the House votes on articles of impeachment which, as the previous commenter said, just formally brings charges against him. This only requires a simple majority in the House.\n\nRemoval from office would then require a 2/3 majority in the Senate, which Republicans in the 90s did not have.\n\nThe Republicans knew this going into it and ultimately the whole motion was an exercise in playing partisan politics.\n\nTo answer your other question, the charge was not the cheating (which isn’t illegal) but rather perjury in his testimony when questioned about it (which obviously is illegal). Trump has lied a lot, but not yet in an official sworn testimony situation.'
"This is not a Bannon book.  It's a book by a journalist (Michael Wolf) who for some inexplicable reason was giving access for months to the White House and interviewed dozens of officials.  \n\nThey are that stupid.  They all bitched to the same journalist and he wrote it all down."
'The fusion gps hearings are horse shit that trump is trying to use as a cover up. Claims the Steele dossier was nothing more than democratic propaganda to make him seem like a bad guy. But in turn he is a bad guy and the Russian collusion really did happen. Yet still there is not much substantial evidence about whether what Christopher Steele put down is true. Mueller is after these rich fucks committing treason and laundering money.'
'"Everyone hates Obama." WTF? Talk about projection!'
"Kay this week has been fucked beyond belief. This is fucking amazing how everyone's finally (aside from this sub) exposing this mother fucker.  Took 200+ charges...."
'What I was referring to was the Russian "grooming" a person who will be running for President, as a Russian agent, puppet, informant, lackey or stooge. The collusion of Trump with Russia and Putin, is a given, but is just a part of the overall conspiracy of the Russian Government and the Trump campaign. The fact that we have actual footage of the "grooming" in action is actually quite remarkable.'
'My "way out there" hypothesis is that Paul Ryan is in deep shit (Ref his PAC\'s extensive use of DNC hacked data, and his odd behavior), but as House Speaker he has to behave - hence he gets his fellow-Freedom Caucus members to do the full-frontal attacks on everything / anything related to the Mueller investigation.'
'What the fucking hell'
'Also, what the fuck is the NY Times doing? CNN? Why is a random lawyer from Los Angeles or something getting a major scoop?'
'Thee are strict rules on foreign involvement in domestic campaign including contributions to campaigns. Laundering the money through an attorney, if proven, is a serious breach and not just a fine but jail time.. And its not just one instance, after receiving the money, if it\'s deemed an illegal contribution every instance he uses the illegal money, is a separate violation. While in most cases, sentences are usually concurrent, but egregious violations can be stacked, which means it could be 10+ years of "tape my butt shut" Federal Prison'
"Trump fucked a lot of women. Many of  whom sought to have their sordid stories made public after Donnie Moscow won the GOP nomination, likely for the money they'd get from the tabloids and the like.  Stormy Daniels is one such woman. To prevent these stories from coming out, Donnie instructed his personal attorney to pay them hush money and sign NDAs to enforce their silence in the months before the election in 2016. That attorney was Cohen. But Donnie Moscow doesn't have much cash lying around, because he's massively in debt to a number of foreign investors (aka leveraged). These investors are mostly Russian oligarchs. So when it comes time to pay that hush money, Donnie has to ask his investors for a little more cash. Cohen goes to Prague to talk to the oligarchs and makes the ask. They comply, and Cohen gets the money. Cohen pays the women. \n\nTLDR; Donnie Moscow used Russian money to pay off porn stars he fucked while the first lady was pregnant with Baron Trump. Yup, it's that salacious. "
'They both suck. \n\nThis election cycle was a bad one. '
'That\'s whats been said, but new information contradicts that. (Trump paying Cohen back)  The violations accrue to Cohen, every time he uses that "tainted money" so if he made payments to Stormy Daniels using that money, its a violation, but also a violation every time he paid out money, that can be established coming from those funds, to pay for things were campaign related or otherwise restricted from doing so.'
'Been watching bum shock fights recently?'
"You're absolutely right.  I'd rather not jam either in my mouth, but it's real obvious which will burn me more / do more lasting damage to the laws and norms that make America a functional democracy."
'This headline is accurate. The rest of this shit article belongs in r/conspiracy. They provide no evidence that dems and NYT is coordinating. '
"I'm no Trump supporter, but this sub has a habit of regularly getting ahead of reality. \n\nIt's a bit worrying, just let Mueller do his job professionally without the hero worship and the credibility-destroying fantasising. "
'A test perhaps? To see which subs ban nonsense?'
'Okay I just got a notification that somebody said "Can you be arrested without charge?" Yes, you can be arrested without charge. Sometimes a suspect is arrested and then questioned before prosecutors decide which charges to file if any. Police can only hold suspects for a limited amount of time before releasing the suspect. The reason this is allowed is because one of the most common methods of catching a criminal is by self incriminating. This is why the only thing you ever tell a police officer if you think you are being investigated is "no comment, I would like a lawyer please." '
"They will fight it to the end.  And next time we have a Democrat president, they'll start a BS investigation on inauguration day to deny that president a SCOTUS pick.   \n\nAny norm we establish, you can count on Mitch McConnell perverting it with a bad faith interpretation the first chance he gets.  So we need to take care."
'There is no actual dividing line between counter-intelligence investigations and criminal investigations and making a new account to troll on that point and advocate separating kids from their parents makes you even more of a piece of shit than you already were.'
"He may not be a target yet but he hasn't said he isn't a suspect. A target is what you become AFTER they decide to arrest your ass"
"I take your point but I'm not sure I really agree.\n\nNorms are just that.  They can be disregarded when inconvenient or plead when useful.\n\nNot stonewalling SCOTUS appointments on a purely partisan basis was a norm until recently, too."
"Why did Cory declare it's a criminal investigation when it's a counter intelligence investigation and identify Trump as a target when he isn't? Nothing Cory said is true.  \n\n>He may not be a target yet but he hasn't said he isn't a suspect.\n\nA suspect in what? This isn't a criminal investigation. \n\n>A target is what you become AFTER they decide to arrest your ass. \n\nAfter they arrest you youre a defendant, not a target. \n\n\n\n\n\n"
'No. When they arrest you, you are under suspicion. You can be arrested so the police can try to extract a confession or some kind of incriminating statement. Once they believe they have enough evidence that would lead to a conviction, then you are charged. Once you are charged, then you are a defendant. '
"What, how does this invalidate a election? Wouldn't this just look really bad on the administration in charge during the election? "
'As far as t-d and my mother goes, seeing this article under the Fox headline is not that big.  Hearing "Gay Shep Smith" reporting this is not that big either.  Hannity will ignore this so that means it fake news.\n\nGet us out of this nightmare - we need Mueller, Cohen\'s audios, some videos, and unimpeachable facts.  '
"He's acting the way he acted during the campaign. There's nothing new now. What the fuck were they 'seeing' before?!?"
"I'm really confused on how you think you have the high ground on this argument. It is good they disagree, that is a victory for people who think Trump is compromised."
'I refuse to believe you\'re unable to grasp the concept of a convergence of evidence toward a conclusion. You\'re arguing in bad faith and you know it -- the "one single proof" bullshit is the exact same nonsense used by holocaust deniers.'
"It's the worst time to release this.  Tomorrow Trump will tweet something containing a vaguely racist thing and by Monday the news will be laser focused on it."
'they probably didn\'t want to kill the momentum of their "gun control" agenda they\'ve been after for years.'
'Anyone else think Giuliani is doing this intentionally?\n\nOtherwise... Holy shit what an idiot'
'>“Democrats I would suggest for their own self-interest, this is not a good issue to go into the midterms.”\n\nFucking dumb shit would probably like that.  I think as more Americans become aware of the guilty pleas his theory will prove more and more bullshit.'
"Isn't he also the guy that claimed there were no extremist Islamic attacks on the US prior to 2008?"
'Or he could just be an evil shit'
"TBH I don't really give even half a shit about his extramarital affairs. I'm MUCH more interested in two things: \n\n1)  The palpable hypocricy that he bought and sold numerous properties from forclosed HUD real estate which was insured with loans from the National Housing Act, one of the very policies that Hannity was highly critical of in the obama adminisration\n\n2) the shady way he hid it in over 20 shell companies and how he teamed up with Jeff Brock, who plead guilty and was convicted in 2016 for federal charges of bank fraud and conspiracy in his role in an operation to rig foreclosure auctions between 2007 and 2012. Some of the houses sold on to the Hannity-linked firm in 2012 had been acquired by Brock from banks later named by prosecutors among his victims. But the justice department declined to identify specific properties sold in the rigged auctions\n\nThis might end with handcuffs. "
"Since he didn't get caught up in the Fox harassment scandals, I think this is unlikely.\n\nHannity was an informal advisor to DJT's campaign. He has been attacking Mueller longer than any of his fellow Fox anchors. \n\nI think there's a good chance his conversations with Cohen related to collusion."
"I'm not at all sure I'd say he's more honest than Trump, if for no other reason than the fact that he's used his bully pulpit to spread lies for a couple decades now. Trump has had the pulpit for a much shorter timeframe. \n\nThey're both despicable liars. Both have built their careers on the backs of their lies, but Hannity's lies have infected political discourse in this country to the extent that we now have Trump in office. If Hannity and his ilk didn't have a pulpit, neither would Trump. "
"> Since he didn't get caught up in the Fox harassment scandals\n\nI guarantee you he took part in constructing the scandal though so he could usurp O'Reilly's position. I'm not saying the sexual harrassment didn't happen, i'm just saying he knew about it and let it blow up so he could take O'Reilly's job. "
"Oh believe me I'm not giving Hannity slack but he got in front of confessing he's a horrible person to the public.  Given the extent of Cohen's services to his two other clients, we may find a mistress but realistically he's gave up some information."
"In all seriousness, #MeToo deserves it based on the criteria. Mueller didn't have THAT much of an effect on the news. Sexual assault and womens rights have dominated the news. I have no idea how the saudi prince fits the criteria as I havn't heard THAT much outta him either."
'I felt so, ashamed when I re-read it.'
"and America stratified into poverty and stupidity could start a world war.  Do we really need another North Korea or Russia on the map?  Might affect things a bit more than islamic terrorists, they're not a mongol horde, coming to eat the christian world, when we have our own capability to pick sides and fight like imbeciles.  "
'> Twist\n\nActually, that\'s not a twist.  This is standard prosecutorial behavior.  "The Twist" is actually the code name for the psyop technique that Mueller is applying to Trump\'s nuts right now.\n\nScene: *The Oval Office.  Trump is at The Resolute Desk shouting into the phone, speaking fluent Russian.  He is surrounded by every member of #TeamTreason, who are all listening in on the call.*\n\nThe door slams open with a thunderous BOOM.\n\nIt\'s Mueller!\n\n#I\'M IN A NUTBUSTING MOOD RIGHT NOW!

'A few things:\n\n- [Nunes is House Intelligence Committee Chairman](https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/27/politics/devin-nunes-house-russia-investigation/index.html).

Instead, the tactic backfired.\n\n- [Nunes stepped back from the investigation amid controversy in April, but did so in a way that fell short of recusal.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/politics/devin-nunes-house-intelligence-committee-russia.html) He kept a lower profile, but he made no promises of non-interference. In fact, there was nothing preventing him from continuing to meddle in the investigation. So predictably...\n\n- [Nunes continued to interfere in the investigation](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-nunes-recuse-or-not-20170602-htmlstory.html), and he eventually [issued subpoenas related to the Steele dossier.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nunes-issues-subpoenas-to-fusion-gps/) This was the dossier that alleged Russian collusion with the Trump campaign, along with some less-relevant but more salacious things involving hookers and piss. Nunes and other Republicans made a concerted attempt to discredit the dossier as untrustworthy and/or part of some Democratic conspiracy despite a steady stream of evidence that the dossier is accurate.\n\n- [Along with with other Republicans, Nunes has tried to mischaracterize the Steele dossier as evidence of corruption at the Department of Justice](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/20/house-republicans-quietly-investigate-doj-fbi-310121). Again, the claims were meritless, but for whatever reason the Steele dossier keeps coming up.  It was already known that the dossier was commissioned as *Republican* opposition research during the primaries and only picked up by the Democrats in the general election. But what makes this especially funny is that..\n\n- [One of Nunes\' donors commissioned the same Steele dossier that Nunes is claiming as evidence of a Democratic conspiracy](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/12/28/1728250/-NEW-Devin-Nunes-Campaign-Donor-Was-Original-Funder-Of-Trump-Russia-Dossier). This is OP\'s story. It\'s not a bombshell, but it\'s just another data point along a trendline that points to what a slimy piece of shit Devin Nunes is. \n\nSo now you know a bit more about Devin Nunes. This should get you started, and in the future just keep your ears to the ground. There will be more. The GOP my be broadly complicit in the Russia Affair, but hacks like Nunes are basically guaranteed to have worse skeletons in their closet.\n\n----\n\n**TL;DR: Nunes is a former Trump transition team member who has been interfering with the House Russia investigation through his position as Chair of the House Intel Committee. He is quite possibly committing obstruction of justice.**'
'Thank you. \n\nI was trying to be as concise and to the point as possible, but you could write a book about Nunes and the fuckery he is involved in. The man was is one of the underappreciated villains of the Russia Affair.\n\n'

'Trump vs. the Porn Star...who are you gonna believe?  The fake blond with the big tits or Story Daniels?'
"Alot of people are not reading between the lines here.\n\nTrump's lawyer made the payment to Stormy Daniels which would normally be OK but counts as an illegal campaign contribution because of his ties to the campaign (working from trump tower). That is campaign fraud, trump can make this go away by returning the money to his lawyer and submitting a statement to the FEC that he provided the money himself. But that would be admitting to an extramarital affair. Which is something he is probably not willing to do yet. This all this relavant to Meuller's special council which is investigating trump for russian meddling and campaign fraud. This story was given to 60 minutes as a gift to Mueller and as political capital to Congressional democrats in case of an impeachment process.\n\nIt can be used by Mueller during a subpoena against the POTUS. That would be bad because trump's head lawyer has resigned and trump is having trouble replacing him. entering a deposition without a lawyer is extremly unadvisable.\n\nTrump can elect to fire Mueller before charges are pressed but republicans have promised this will lead to impeachment. Which would buy him time and he may have a better chance of winning through his allies in congress.\n\nTLDR. This isn't just disgusting sex gossip, If trump doesn't handle his stormy Daniel's problem, he is looking campaign fraud charges."

"I'm exaggerating *a little,* but there was some obvious sexual misconduct going on there.  Whether it was just groping and such or full on rape I can't say, but Trump did make comments about other young girls while Ivanka was around the same age."
"This is the one that always makes Trump supporters REEEE, but it's also worth noting that there's a lawsuit accusing Trump of raping a girl when she was 13 (I believe).  It was delayed because of too many death threats to the accuser, which is not at all surprising.  Perhaps after his ultimate fall from grace it will proceed."

'Who are my overlords this time?\n\nCuz it certainly isn\'t the Republican president OR the Republican "pretending" to investigate his ass.\n\nYou fuckers will see when Mueller comes out of his cave in 3 years to say "Turns out treason is legal now" while you assholes enabled him and his orange Russian oligarch.  \n\nStringing people on with false hope while he destroys our country ... and you think I\'M the one doing harm?'
'Every day I come out here and I read and I read and I get a little Hopeless that nothing has happened to start the avalanche. I have to remind myself of how methodical Mueller’s team has been up to this point. \n\nI know I should be patient, but for fucks sake it’s killing me. \n'

But we may see. '
"I'd like to be wrong, as long as Mueller has enough to take out Pence, too-- the thought of that asshole becoming President is actually worse than Trump, since he's got all the evil plus a functioning brain."
"Assuming nothing happens until after the midterms and the dems take control of the senate,  I have ABSOLUTELY no issue with Pence becoming President. \n\nI agree that he's actually worse than Trump but with the dems in charge of the senate, he's impotent. Dems could prevent him from implementing anything crazy and could/should block him from making crazy appointments on the same Lame Duck grounds the R's used. \n\nHis one benefit relative to Trump is that he's unlikely to drag us into a war. I'll take that scenario happily, as long as he doesn't have a compliant Congress to actually advance his agenda. "

This forces a lot of people, who previously may have spent time reading comments that further illuminated the original story, to just give up.

'We all know the mechanism that\'s keeping Trump in place. Republican politicians are caught between two contrasting entities here.\n\nThere\'s the billionaire donor class who fund their reelection attempts. They want tax cuts, decimation of the welfare state and a massive rollback of business and environment regulation. (Along with huge, juicy government contracts for preferred bidders.) Trump is just the turkey to provide such obscene material gifts to the super-rich. At the expense of ordinary working Americans of course.\n\nSecondly there\'s a working and middle class Republican base that regards Trump as the answer to all their problems. (Whether financial, social or religious.) Fox News and their ilk of course tend to keep these supporters in line and on the Trump train. \n\nThe billionaire business class are for all intents and purpose sociopathic. Whether that\'s psychological or just a reflection of our hyper-capitalistic economic model is irrelevant for the time being. They\'re beyond reaching. Which leaves us with the Republican voter base...\n\nThe absolute last thing to do is dismiss these people as somehow stupid or uneducated. It might be a simple aphorism but "you catch more flies with honey than vinegar" is an absolute time-tested truth. You don\'t talk someone down from a ledge by telling them how stupid they are. \n\nIt\'s time to chip around the edges of the Republican base. Particularly with the mid-term elections just months away. Firing up the Democratic base is one thing but understanding the needs, desires and concerns of centrists voters and reluctant Trump voters might well be the key to the Democrats retaking both houses come November.

"Small towns have been collapsing for decades.  And for decades, the only party looking them in the eye and giving them an explanation has been the Republicans.  It's a lie, and a scam, but they've at least acknowledged them.  The Democrats, conversely, know that it's just a natural process of industrialization and the resultant urbanization, and have let it go.  The Republicans are literally the ones making it worse for them, but at least they're acknowledging it.  Of course those populations overwhelmingly turned to them as their only hope.\n\nProgressives are unquestionably the future of the Democratic Party.  People right now act flabbergasted that Bernie's rally in Kansas had such incredible turnout, but they shouldn't be.  Of course it would.  The Democrats are the only ones capable of actually helping working class people.  They just need to realize that a ton of the working poor in this country live on the outskirts, and start addressing them, just as Bernie has.  Again, they've put their faith in these lies because they've been told only lies, and they've heard nothing to contrary.  We need more Democrats like Bernie out there addressing them, and recognizing that their struggle is real, and that it's only as bad as it is because the Republicans are abusing them."
'Democrats sound like pathetic boot lickers these days. Criticisizing people for challenging the CIA.

'This is exactly what I expect.  But, I also think this is what will happen 1. If he loses reelection or 2. When his two terms are up.  Trumps rube shitbags will absolutely start a massive civil conflict when he leaves office, under any circumstances.  They have completely lost touch with reality.'
'Or is he retiring because he’s about to be spending full time with his lawyers? This looks more and more like a wave of conspiracy charges are coming. All these republicans knew about things that they now understand are being prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. If you know a crime is going to be committed or is being committed and do nothing, you can be charged with conspiracy to commit said crime.'
'No they won’t, they’ll cry about it on the forums and talk about how they are locked and loaded. But they won’t do anything because they have a lot to lose. They’re home, job, or lives are not actually worth that man, they just like that he “sticks it to those cuck libs.”\nThat’s not enough to foment violent revolution. When people are starving in the streets, that’s when violent civil revolt happens, when people have literally nothing to lose.'
"It really does seem to be the end goal of his megaphoning conspiracies into their ears. No matter the outcome for him, it will undoubtedly be someone else's fault. If he's impeached, a rigged congress that's propped up by crooked dems. If he loses an election, a rigged process stolen by vengeful Hillary shills. I don't see any path where he doesn't get to use his malice and delusions in a vengeful way. "
"That doesnt mean there isnt going to be violence though. The media keeps going on about it being the end of the world. A lot of delusional people have access to guns. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw more shootings/massacres.\n\nIt's disgusting to me that this violence has become so normalized that I can speak of this nonchalantly"
"[NYT:](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/us/politics/trump-michael-flynn.html)\n\n>If Mr. Trump had known at the time that Mr. Flynn lied to the F.B.I., that could amount to obstruction of justice.\n\nWhat the Trump team is going to argue is that Trump's intentional meaning of the Tweet is that he confused the current allegations with the initial firing. Whether a court/Congress would believe that to be reasonable doubt is questionable. It's the same reason that Trump's admission on live TV that he fired Comey because of Russia can have reasonable doubt. \n\n"
'I do not normally watch Fox News, but the local channel broadcasts it. The TV was left on today, and they were talking about this.  One of the guys on this "panel" actually had the audacity to say (paraphrasing) "Since Flynn admitted he lied to the FBI, anything he testifies could also be a lie, so don\'t listen to anything he says!".\n\nDo these folks even believe what is coming out of their mouths?  Can they be that dumb?   If Flynn is testifying, heads are gonna roll, full stop.  Which head(s) exactly, remains to be seen.'
'What? He fired Flynn because he lied. Comey was fired for not doing his job. Obama administration gave Flynn permission. Another failed anti Trump sub '
'You must be fit for you to undergo such rigorous mental gymnastics to come up with that conclusion from this tweet.\n\nOr an outright liar, which is typical of you disgusting antifa Democrats.'
'I tried to step back for a second last night and think about all of this from a historical context and what kind of precedence (or "presidents" if you\'re Trump) this sets. Trump\'s ascension along with the series of scandals in its wake just seems so far beyond the pale of normalcy. \n\nMy concern is that removing Trump from office via impeachment or  through elections, will not restore order to our institutions and government. We\'ve crossed the bridge and burned it down. Even if Trump is gone, we have a sizable population of people that are fiercely loyal to Trump as a person, as well as his tactics and political philosophy. That is a major problem. The institutions, checks and balances  and civil order that our nation is founded upon is under attack - removing a President will not shore up the systematic framework of the nation; it will still be on fire.\n\nAbraham Lincoln\'s Lyceum Address has been echoing in my head during the election and throughout Trump\'s first year in office:\n\n> "Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow? Never! All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not by force take a drink from the Ohio or make a track on the Blue Ridge in a trial of a thousand years. At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer. If it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us; it cannot come from abroad. **If destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen we must live through all time or die by suicide.**"\n\nLets hope we are able to recover, both institutionally as well as a community of people, from the divide that we find ourselves in currently.'

"Reposting another comment I previously made in another thread\n\n>I can't believe there are people who actually believe Trump will speak with Mueller. No attorney in the world would let their client speak with the prosecutor- doing otherwise would be tantamount to malpractice or ineffective assistance of counsel. This is fake media drama to fill time until Mueller actually makes his move. If Trump gets subpoenaed, he'll plead the fifth (**just like any reasonable defendant would, regardless of guilt**) and that will be that. Democrats and the left will forget all of the times they defended the fifth as a vital safeguard for the criminally accused (which it is), and claim that pleading the fifth is an admission of guilt (it isn't). Republicans will suddenly forget all the times they claimed only guilty people plead the fifth (because they're hypocritical trash)."

"Yeah ok, but that's not the same thing. That article is talking about a private crime, where you're not a public figure facing very public accusations.

He's not doing that, he's doing the exact opposite.\n\nOf course if I was guilty of these things and worse, then I would obstruct, muddy and re-direct the discussion. "

"See, the Right likes to bring up the founding fathers all the time, but this is what the founding fathers were ACTUALLY worried about: they were worried about a king who had enough power to bully the citizens and bankrupt the country with no one who could make him stop. Back in those days, it wasn't the constitutional monarchy like England has now. It was a king who was very powerful and a parliament who had some power, but still had to bow to the king's will in many different matters. He was no simple figurehead. \n\nIf Trump does fire Mueller, we must impeach because Trump will be acting as if he's a king. Not just because what he's doing is illegal, but because the thing he's doing is illegal *because absolute monarchy is illegal*. "
'I think often over the dumb patriot movement that was justified by crazy right wing conspiracies over Obama FEMA death camps, Obama turning the police into a military to declare martial law etc. This lead to to a whole demographic fantasizing over this idea of being the next "patriots" to take up arms against a "tyrannical" government. Spending their retirement, and creating debt to invest in prepping for a walking dead scenario (without Zombies) and a civil war. These people want a civil war.

Often by making normal everday folks who simply aren't liberal or left out to be racist xenophobic gun wielding boogey men.\n\nIt's bull shit and while not every member of the media does that shit.

There are timelines available which compare each. Mueller's is by far the most productive, having secured multiple indictments and guilty pleas in a fraction of the time it took previous counsels. And there are multiple plea deals which, at the very least, indicate the buck has not stopped rising up the ladder yet. If the indictments stop at Don Jr. And Kushner for their Trump Tower meetings, I would say that would be the luckiest and best outcome Trump could wish for. \n"

FBI Director James Comey said **more than 2,000 emails contained classified information and some of them “bore markings indicating the presence of classified information.”**\n>* Clinton said her lawyers “went through every single email” to determine which ones were personal and which were work-related, and that they were “overly inclusive” in which ones were provided to the State Department. **Comey said the lawyers did not go through every email. Rather, they used header information and search terms to identify work-related emails, and, he said, it is “highly likely” they missed some.**\n\n>Clinton was wrong when she said her lawyers “went through every single email” and were “overly inclusive” in what they provided to the State Department.\n\nCompared to the Justice Department's approach in [mishandling classified material with Jerry Lee](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/01/mishandling-classified-material-former-cia-agent-case-compares-clinton/) , who is currently in custody for doing almost exactly what Hillary did:\n\n>There is no evidence (at least no public evidence at this point) that Lee had any motive or took any action to harm the United States. **It was based on such an absence of traitorous intent that the Obama Justice Department and the FBI — and, more important, President Obama himself — rationalized dropping the Clinton investigation rather than filing an indictment**.\n>  In Lee’s case, to the contrary, the Justice Department finds that traitorous intent is not an element of the offense. The prosecution must merely show that Lee acted willfully: i.e., aware that his conduct was illegal, he intentionally retained classified information in a place not authorized for its storage (and during a time when he was no longer authorized to possess it).  \n\nLee is facing life in prison, for the exact same crime we **know** Hillary committed.\n\n(See next part)\n"

Four Americans died. Even the State Department Accountability Review Board report that many Republicans say is a whitewash is unsparing in its portrait of Washington’s indifference to the crumbling security situation. **The report said the security posture was “grossly inadequate” to deal with the attacks:**\n\n> “The number of Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) security staff in Benghazi on the day of the attack and in the months and weeks leading up to it was inadequate, **despite repeated requests from Special Mission Benghazi and Embassy Tripoli for additional staffing. Board members found a pervasive realization among personnel who served in Benghazi that the Special Mission was not a high priority for Washington when it came to security-related requests**, especially those relating to staffing. \n\n>The **insufficient Special Mission security platform was at variance with the appropriate Overseas Security Policy Board (OSPB) standards with respect to perimeter and interior security. Benghazi was also severely under-resourced with regard to certain needed security equipment, although DS funded and installed in 2012 a number of physical security upgrades.”**\n\nAlso, from [the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/state-dept-downgraded-security-in-libya-before-deadly-attack-ex-officer-claims/2012/10/10/d7195faa-12e6-11e2-a16b-2c110031514a_story.html?utm_term=.370042dcbc4f)\n\n>The **State Department acknowledged Wednesday that it rejected appeals for more security at its diplomatic posts in Libya** in the months before a fatal terrorist attack in Benghazi as Republicans suggested that lapses contributed to the deaths of the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.\nMilitary response during attacks:\n\nFrom [Military.com](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2016/06/28/benghazi-probe-finds-marines-response-slowed-uniform-changes.html)\n\n>Among these were delays imposed on the 50-man Marine Fleet Anti-terrorism Security Team, or FAST, which launched from Rota, Spain, more than 2,000 miles away from Benghazi. **The team was loaded onto C-130 aircraft, but held on the ground for three hours before being allowed to take off.**\n\n> According to the report, Navy Vice Adm. Kurt Tidd, then-director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified that the **State Department had dithered about how to send forces into Libya without creating a larger international incident.**\n\n>The Marine commander of the FAST platoon, unnamed in the report, testified that the Marines\' orders changed constantly as they waited to depart.\n\n>"We were told **multiple times to change what we were wearing, to change from cammies into civilian attire, civilian attire into cammies, cammies into civilian attire**," he said. "There was also **some talk of whether or not we could carry our personal weapons. ** I was basically holding hard and fast to the point where we were carrying our personal weapons. Like, we\'ve got a very violent thing going on the ground where we\'re going, so we\'re going to be carrying something that can protect ourselves."\n\n>Ultimately, the commander said, the **Marines would change in and out of uniform four times.**\n\n>"Although [then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army Gen. Martin] Dempsey told the U.S. Senate that once forces began moving, \'nothing stopped us, nothing slowed us,\' it appears the U.S. Military\'s response that night was delayed -- because it started too late" \n\n>It remains unclear whether the three-hour delay made a difference in the fast-moving events of that night in Libya. Ultimately, the FAST Marines were never ordered to Benghazi\n\nUSA Today:\n\n>The [House GOP Benghazi] report also sheds new light on previous conclusions that the military was unable to respond quickly enough to perform a rescue. The Republicans found that "despite President Obama and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta’s clear orders to deploy military assets, nothing was sent to Benghazi, and **nothing was en route to Libya at the time the last two Americans were killed almost 8 hours after the attacks began.**"\n\n[Timeline of events](https://www.lifezette.com/polizette/where-was-the-military-during-benghazi/), verified but in a less clear fashion [from Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-libya-pentagon/pentagon-releases-benghazi-timeline-defends-response-idUSBRE8A903U20121110).\n\n> * The attack began at 9:42 p.m. local time, or 3:42 p.m. Washington time.\n> *    At 4:32 p.m., the Pentagon\'s National Military Center as notified of the attack.\n\n>* At 6:34 p.m., terrorists began attacking the CIA annex.\n> * At about 7 p.m., roughly 2.5 hours after the National Military Center was notified, then-Secretary of Defense Leon  Panetta ordered three different units deployed: The Marine Fleet Anti-Terrorism Support Team, or FAST; a Commanders In Extremis Force, or "CIF;" and a hostage rescue team based in the United States.\n> *    At 10:15 p.m., terrorists killed Stevens.\n> *    At 10 a.m. the next morning — 18 hours later after the attack began — the FAST Platoon finally took off from Spain.\n> *    At about 11 a.m., the CIF took off.\n> *    At about 2 p.m., the CIF arrived at a staging base.\n> *    At 2:56 p.m., the FAST team arrived in Tripoli.\n> *    At 3:28 p.m., a Special Operations Force deployed from the United States arrived at a staging base.\n\n> The report describes discussions about how military personnel should respond. The FAST platoon sat on a plane in Rota, Spain, for three hours and changed in and out of their uniforms four times as officials vacillated on minute details. The State Department insisted the military respond in civilian clothing and in vehicles without military markings — out of an apparent concern for offending the Libyan government.\n\n> should i take the time to dig up the proof that you are lying? i don\'t see why.\n\n\nI know why.  Because there is no proof, because everything I\'ve said is verifiably true in the public record.  I\'m sorry if you\'re not happy with the truth. You can argue Hillary was not the sole person making these decisions.  But she is the Secretary of State.  So bears responsibility for the outcomes, good and bad.\n\nThese are the kinds of things reported in unbiased media.\n\n> all you are doing is trolling with anti-clinton bullshit. i don\'t see why tho - she isn\'t president, isn\'t running for anything ever again, and holds no public office or position of influence.\n\nYou didn\'t read the posts.  /u/141252363452 tried, laughably, to argue that coverage on Clinton was the same as coverage of Trump.  She brought it up.  You\'re misunderstanding of the facts proves the point (maybe), how biased that coverage was, that you think the truth is a lie.\n\nAnd, I\'m happy to never talk about Clinton again.\n\n\n> so yeah, fuck trump and fuck you. \n\nClassy as always.

All is on the public record.\n\n> this is what makes people like you so dangerous. you don't believe in the rule of law, or really anything american. you'll take and twist america into a pretzel to jail and execute hillary clinton.\n\nWell, yeah, it's because I believe in the rule of law.  I don't desire to see Hillary Clinton in jail, that doesn't accomplish anything.  I believe it cost her the chance to be President (appropriately), which is punishment enough.  She clearly should not be allowed to handle any classified documents, but that's a fairly moot point.\n\n> go ahead - deny it. deny that's what you want. see how convincing you are.\n\nThe only thing I desire is for politicians to be treated like anyone else who breaks the law. \n"
'[McCabe, lying to the FBI, while under oath:](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/01/mishandling-classified-material-former-cia-agent-case-compares-clinton/)\n \n>The new report from the Justice Department inspector general concludes that **Andrew McCabe, the former FBI deputy director, lied to then-FBI Director James Comey, to other FBI agents, and to officials of the Office of the Inspector General. Some of those lies came when McCabe was under oath.**\n\n> The inspector general has completed his work. The question now is, will the Justice Department prosecute McCabe? Or, put another way: Will the FBI and the Justice Department follow the same rules they apply to members of the public who lie to a federal agent?\n\n> Remember, the only charge brought against Gen. Michael Flynn, the former national security advisor to President Donald Trump, was lying to the FBI, a felony.

Here is the answer. **The left starts counting Mr. Obama’s deficit meter in 2010, after he passed the $800 billion debt bomb fiscal stimulus bill.**\n\n>So they assigned the gargantuan deficit in Mr. Obama’s first year to Mr. Bush....  it is true that the deficit was going to be much higher ... because of the deep recession that ended in June 2009. So in fairness some of the bad number in 2009 was Bush’s fault.\n\n> But Mr. **Obama made the deficit hundreds of billions of dollars worse with a stimulus plan that by the administration’s own admission didn’t create a single new job. (The number of jobs in 2009, 2010, and 2011 was lower than Mr. Obama’s economists predicted we would get if we had done nothing and not wasted $800 billion.**\n\n> Then you haven\'t looked at opinion polls.

This is because *mens rea* (intent) is a central component of information-related crimes (physical theft of property, i.e. displacing it from the owner's possession, is a different matter and that distinction also exists in, e.g., espionage statutes; see 18 USC §793(f))."

And he never leaked anything of strategic value. It's almost like he was just there to change the narrative from one of anger at the DNC for election rigging to anger at the Russians for supposedly exposing their election rigging.\n\nBtw, the FBI never conducted a proper investigation into the DNC hack.

These are important details that would constitute actual evidence if they were included. They are not. It's ok. They don't have to be.

Much like the ones that were set in the impeachment hearings for then President Bill Clinton because *he lied under oath*.  If nothing else (and there's plenty) it's not hard to see a case against trump *when* he eventually has to go before congress, a grand jury, or both.

Only the Govenor of that State can pardon him.\n\nNew York, Florida, and Nevada are all likely States where Trump will be indicted for State crimes related to his money laundering activities.\n\nSo at the end of the day, Trump has a high likelihood of ending up in prison for the rest of his life, with Pence not being able to do a damn thing about it. It's the main reason why Trump is running scared right now; if you dont believe me, go watch yesterdays response he gave about his personal lawyer being raided and tell me thay's the body language of some whi's confident they are safe. The line in the sand was his finances because he wasn't given protection from Russia about his entire past, only the election."
">Legal experts said Mr. Trump’s contact with the men most likely did not rise to the level of witness tampering. But witnesses and lawyers who learned about the conversations viewed them as potentially a problem and shared them with Mr. Mueller.\n\n>“It makes it look like you’re cooking a story, and prosecutors are always looking out for it,” said Julie R. O’Sullivan, a law professor at Georgetown University and expert on white-collar criminal investigations.\n\n>She added, “It can get at the issue of consciousness of guilt in an obstruction case because if you didn’t do anything wrong, why are you doing that?”\n\nWell, that's what criminals do.

'No he is just controlling the narrative so if he loses, he has someone to blame'

Russia WANTS for there to be riots.  They will have people in place trying to make it happen.  \nWhen it does it will be an international incident and Trump would declare Martial Law.  \n\nThe elections are only four days before but the Democrats won\'t assume office until January!\n\nPutin will likely have a substantial entourage of Russian spies. \n\nThe 20,000 person (now 35,000) "immigrant detention centers" on military bases are still being built, despite there not being a need for that much capacity.

'With no lines drawn either. Civil unrest and violence widespread. I’ve got to imagine governors are making sure their plans in the case of a break down in federal structure resulting from multiple people claiming control are in order. '
'Laws were still broken.  Prison sentences will still need to be served.'
'This is terrifying.  My fear this entire ride is that the truth is scarier than we can imagine '

'But why the fuck are you still obsessed with her?'
'>Sorry, but the \'Russia narrative\' is far from fabricated,\n\nZero evidence. \n\n>you know foreign intelligence agencies informed the fbi, cia and nsa of these hacks since 2014. \n\nThats a different narrative. Russia always tries to hack us. Thats different from the collusion narrative. Weird how you conflate the two. \n\n>Americans get scary little information (and truth) from watching fox news all day, but you\'ll be surprise how deep the trump team was invested in Russia and how deep the reach of the Russians went.\n\nDont assume my sources. I read the same wapo nyt and CNN articles you do. All the "connections" are tangential at best and straight rumor at worst. \n\n>Every European country has a list of meetings with, for instance, kushner and Russian spies and investors, yet the only news you ever get is the trump tower meeting. That\'s literally the tip of the iceberg. \n\nSee the thing about spies is... theyre spies. Deception and infiltration is kind of their thing. Further, theyre not very good spies if we can publically identify them. \n\nAnd the thing about investors is theyre investors. Giving money to buisness ventures is kinda their thing. \n\nThats why theres still NO EVIDENCE of collusion with Russia. And A WHOLE LOT OF EVIDENCE the investigation is a sham started and/or propigated by Trump\'s political opponents. \n\nHe was elected fair and square. The left needs to accept that. Hillary was the worst candidate in modern presidential history. Occams razor suggests thats why Trump was elected. Not some vast Russian conspiracy (that didnt seem to pan out as sanctions against Russia are still in place, america is strengthening our military and opening up domestic oil reserves. All moves that are decidedly not Russian friendly) to get him elected. \n\nAt most, at the very very most, Russians probably put out some memes against Hillary because she pretty much guarenteed war with russia with her no fly zone in Syria. \n\n Anti Hillary does not mean pro Trump. \n\nEdit. Got em.\n\n\n\n\n\n'

The first batch of these tanks immediately ended up in control of Iran's sectarian militant groups in Syria like [Hezbollah](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdhC_WXW0AAPKMa.jpg) and [Asaib ahl Al-haq](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdcQgPDWwAAhid3.jpg).\n\nThese groups joined in with Kremlin & it's own paramilitary forces in joint offensives, including attacks against U.S. forces and it's allies. One of these attacks was a [spectacular failure](http://www.newsweek.com/total-f-russian-mercenaries-syria-lament-us-strike-killed-dozens-818073) due to Ru MoD leaving it's un-official military out to dry.\n\nRussia armed and joined in logistically with forces that attacked the U.S. and it's allies.

'I\'m starting to think this as well. From Dump\'s and his followers viewpoint, the pee tape, if it does indeed exist, can easily be defended and like what gnorn said, as long as it was consensual, his base will eat it up. Like so many other stories and scandals, he\' ll just play the waiting game and after a few months or so, newer scandals and stories will have overshadowed it.\n\nBut underage girls, now that\'s something else as it\'s actually illegal. There\'s nothing illegal about having girls pee on a bed or on yourself. These are always the first points that Dump\'s followers bring up. Well, is it illegal? they\'d ask. And usually, it would be NO, there is no criminal law saying that it is. But having sex with underage girls, now that\'s a different story. Again, he could argue that those "underage" girls were legal in Russia or that he was "told" by many people that they were. You start to notice a pattern with this moron. He always likes to deflect blame away from himself and so he concocts these ideas in his head that "many people" told him so and so. And so by doing that, he thinks he\'s free of blame.\n\nBut either way, it has to be much bigger than just normal pee tapes to get this narcissist person so scared.'

'**Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations**\n\nDonald Trump, an American businessman and current President of the United States, has been accused of sexual assault and sexual harassment, including non-consensual kissing or groping, by at least fifteen women since the 1980s. Those accusations have resulted in three widely reported instances of litigation: his then-wife Ivana made a rape claim during their 1989 divorce litigation but later recanted that claim; businesswoman Jill Harth sued Trump in 1997 alleging breach of contract while also suing for nonviolent sexual harassment but withdrew the latter suit when the former was settled; and, in 2017, former Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos filed a defamation lawsuit after Trump called her a liar.\n\nTwo of the allegations (by Ivana Trump and Jill Harth) became public before Trump\'s candidacy for president, but the rest arose after a 2005 audio recording was leaked during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump was recorded bragging that a celebrity like himself "can do anything" to women, including "just start kissing them ...\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

It will be a staunch denial through the ongoing investigation, impending impeachment, likely removal from office, and subsequent appeals.  Even if found guilty and jailed, he would never accept a pardon because that comes with an admission of guilt and his pride won’t allow that.  '

"Correct, Mueller's team dictated to Trump lawyers the questions that had been presented by the prosecution.

'UK here, not sure I understand the 5th amendment.  Can someone enlighten me?\n\nWhat I know: it\'s a clause that allows you to just stay quiet if asked a question under oath, because back in the day torture and whatnot would force people to answer questions.\n\nWhat I don\'t get: how does this not make your position worse?  If I\'m being questioned and I say I\'m taking the 5th, does it not make me look 10x worse than just answering the questions?  You\'re all but saying "if I actually open my mouth you\'ll probably find out even more stuff, so I\'m going to be quiet now."'
'It’s a disgrace unless it involves his fat orange ass or one of his cronies. Only an idiot would listen to that fat fuck.'
"It's an amendment in the US constitution which allows defendants to not have to testify against themselves. It does make their position worse, but less worse than if they would be forced to testify against themselves."
"I'd just like to elaborate a point: per American law, there is no detriment to refusing to testify; juries are not allowed to make an adverse inference because a defendant pleads the 5th. In practice however, it does look bad and those that plead the 5th get convicted a lot more than those who testify."
"I don't believe pleading the fifth counts as an admission of guilt, but it does make the defendant look guilty, and a jury is allowed to make a negative inference from it. It does look shifty as hell, and shows what a desperate position he's in."
"Sort of. Key phrase bolded.\n\n> AMENDMENT V: No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; **nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself**, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\n\nThere are two kinds of trials, civil and criminal. Basically, if you plead the fifth in a criminal trial, the prosecution isn't allowed to call you as a witness. So you can't be tried by ordeal or convicted on the basis that you refused to talk. In America, you're innocent unless the prosecution proves you guilty, so (theoretically) even if pleading the fifth makes you look shifty, the jury still isn't supposed to charge you unless the prosecutor can actually *prove* you dunnit.\n\nMostly doesn't apply in civil cases, but the stakes are lower in civil court. And there's even an exception to let you plead the 5th if testifying might (truly or falsely) implicate you in criminal charges."
'The rest of the world is relying on you guys to get out there and vote. Please do! They say the Dems have no message but fuck them and fuck Trump. The man is the antithesis of western liberal democracy an enlightenment values. That’s the god damned message!\n\nThe rest of us are right behind you.'
"I upvoted this. Perhaps I was too cavilier here—if the House chooses to impeach after November, public opinion could take hold, and Republicans in the Senate could flip—maybe Trump will run like Nixon did.  Why would they scoff at a Mike Pense presidency (given he doesn't get tangled up in the Mueller probe)? They know him, therefore they can work with him.  Trump ushered in the donor class tax cuts, and I think after they will grow tired of him very shortly. He served his purpose, but his ego cannot be supported or held—there are discontents emerging between Trump and the oligarchs regarding these foolish tariffs. \n\nMaybe I'm wrong. We shall see "
"The folks who voted him in, the GOP's open embrace of overt racism, his Supreme Court picks, a weakened regulatory framework, environmental damage, and weakened/strained relationships with historical allies and trade partners... The negative effects of his presidency will reverberate for 50 years - more if he starts a war."

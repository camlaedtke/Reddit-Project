George W Bush: 'There's pretty clear evidence Russia meddled' in US election won by Trump
Mueller just dropped THE HAMMER on Russia! Announced that top Russian officials hacked the DNC and boards of election across the United States. Enjoy your visit with Putin, Donald Trump.
President Putin admits supporting Donald Trump. Don't let this be scrubbed.

Poll: Most Americans support passing a law to protect Mueller
Now a seventh Ohio wrestler is on record saying Jim Jordan knew about pervasive sexual abuse. Jordan is doing his best to interfere with the Mueller investigation, so Trump says he believes Jordan "one hundred percent." Welcome to Republican family values.

THE MUELLER DOESN'T WORK ALONE. AMERICA'S DREAM TEAM INCLUDES ZAINAB AHMAD, A PAKISTANI AMERICAN MUSLIM WOMAN THAT HAS A 13-0 RECORD AGAINST TERRORISTS. SHE IS THE WONDER WOMAN TO MUELLER'S BATMAN. SHOW HER SOME LOVE!!!
After FINALLY convincing my biker father and some of his friends to look at whats going on I made huge post pleading with more to do the same.
This hat I just saw made me smile. Thought it might be appreciated here.
Trump says he surrounds himself with the best people. Mueller does it better.
What Happens If Trump Refuses To Be Interviewed By Mueller? -- If the White House does choose defiance and Mueller responds with a subpoena, it would likely set up a high-stakes legal showdown—one in which the special counsel might have the upper hand.
In a closed-door meeting, Trump casually comments it might be good to consolidate power like China and make himself president for life.
White House says Trump will NOT be congratulating Putin on his election win, in part because of recent nerve agent attacks as well as serious irregularities in the Russian election. Trump, on his own, promptly calls Putin to congratulate him on his landslide “victory”.
Congratulations! /r/The_Mueller has been chosen as a trending subreddit for 2017-10-30.
Republicans want this man off the investigation. Let's remind them that the Jawline of Justice is always watching!
Gotta love the hypocrisy!
"Facebook Inc. has handed over to special counsel Robert Mueller detailed records about the Russian ad purchases on its platform that go beyond what it shared with Congress last week"
This would be the greatest thing ever.
"The president of the United States put the methodical assessments of his own country’s intelligence services on an equal footing with the denials of one of America’s most underhanded enemies." -- And the Republican party is not doing one thing about it.
A GOP Hill staffer just told me she was instructed today to keep her distance from Devin Nunes, his staff and the GOP House Intel Cmte staff, because it looks like they are targets "of multiple ongoing investigations by Special Counsel Mueller's
Trump won’t enforce Russian sanctions after his CIA and National Intelligence Directors secretly meet with heads of Russia’s 3 major intelligence services.
I think this might be the best idea ever
It’s not an army of one: let’s show some love for Dreeben, Weissman, Quarles, Rhee, Zebley, Van Grack, Atkinson, Goldstein, Ahmad, Prelogar, Page, Jed, Zelinsky and all of the other patriots on Mueller’s team.

Today I am thankful for a guy who never had fake bone spurs
Trump: “I’m drawing a red line with the Special Counsel investigating my finances.” Robert Mueller and his team: “Fuck your red line.” LMAO
Trump just said he wishes he had picked a different Attorney General. Why? Because he wants an Attorney General who will actively help in his ongoing Obstruction of Justice.
Here's how Trump responded to Mueller's new indictments: "The stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration ... Why didn’t they do something about it ... DNC Server ... Deep State?" Ok, Republican party, this is the line. Do you stand for this?
I'm trying to keep track, but this is getting out of hand.
Trump Jr. and Other Aides Met With Gulf Emissary Offering Help to Win Election
It's all about global warming. The Russians ACTUALLY WANT to cause global warming because it will benefit them with more land to farm and arctic circle shipping lanes. This is why they want Trump in office and why Pruitt is shutting down the EPA.
Trump applied for a trademark for "Make American Great Again" days after the 2012 election.
It's a beautiful Friday thanks to this man

Mueller's case against Manafort is so strong he's not even asking Gates to help with that part of the investigation
You love this as much as I do. Admit it.
Trump, earlier today: "Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election!" -- Republican party, are you going to continue to stand with this traitor, against America and the UNANIMOUS CONCLUSION OF US INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES?
The rule of law, civil liberties, and civil rights - these are not our burdens.

'Hey, friend! Just so you know, being the "subject" of an investigation isn\'t the same as being a "target" in an investigation.\n\n"The term “target of an investigation” is also specifically defined by the DOJ. A person is a target where the prosecutor or Grand Jury has substantial evidence linking him to the commission of a crime. Designation as a target provides a clear warning of a person’s criminal exposure."\n\nIt\'s entirely possible he is no longer a subject and has now become a target. Politicians and lawyers are very tricky with their words for a reason. \n\nI hope this helps you. :) '

"The description of Trump's hair by Ivanka in Wolff's book was absolute gold. The whole book is gold, to be honest, but I'll go ahead and transcribe that part for those who haven't had time to read it yet:\n\n> ...in at least one television interview she made fun of his comb-over. She often described the mechanics behind it to friends: an absolutely clean pate -- a contained island after scalp reduction surgery -- surrounded by a furry circle of hair around the sides and front, from which all ends are drawn up to meet in the center and then swept back and secured by a stiffening spray. The color, she would point out to comical effect, was from a product called Just for Men -- the longer it was left on, the darker it got. Impatience resulted in Trump's orange-blond hair color."

'Sacramento has a pretty major inferiority complex. We\'re constantly overshadowed by the Bay Area and L.A. & the Sierras in public perception of California. And the residents of those areas look down on Sacramento as they do the entirety of the central valley, despite Sacramento\'s demographics and culture being closer to the megalopolis side of the spectrum. So we\'re always looking for any opportunity to distinguish ourselves from the likes of Fresno, Stockton, or Yuba City.\n\n\nEven most of the people here buy into it; I constantly hear people talk about Sac as a great place to *live* because "it\'s 90 minutes from everything you could want: The mountains to the east, SF to the west, Napa & wine country northwest, Santa-Cruz beaches southwest and only a couple hours from Yosemite." But it\'s never described as a great place to *visit*.'

"There is every indication that if Trump nominates someone like Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin himself to Kennedy's seat (there is no law barring this and there is also no law keeping him from serving concurrently as President of the Russian Federation and a Supreme Court of the United States justice), then Mitch McTurtle will go nuclear to push the nomination through anyway. "
"I just love how they want us to believe that as the head of justice he can't obstruct justice. Even if he is the target. \n\nNext I am waiting for his legal team to put forth the proclamation that as president it isn't even possible for him to commit a crime. "
"Yeah don't people get how this works?? The NEXT president will pardon Trump, making sure he never faces charges. We learned a lot from Nixon"
"It's really easy to get around this though. Pence can pardon him. He just has to be president temporary by Trump invoking the 25th"
"I'm pretty sure that the whole point of Trump saying he can pardon himself is the same reason he tells any of his lies: to feed a twisted narrative to his base."
"It's about the SCOTUS, but there is an article in the Constitution that states a man must not act as a judge in a case in which he has an interest, it's one of the natural laws they base the Constitution on, if trump pardons himself, we will have a constitutional crisis that should not only lead to impeachment, but a reversal of the pardon, a Supreme Court ruling, and public outrage on a scale never before seen."
"I think if he tries to pardon Manafort it will necessitate and force the hand of the senate to bring it to an impeachment vote. Manafort's a pompous rich douchebag who is about to go to jail for 20 years. Think he will flip? He's about to squeal."
'Exactly. All this noise about self-pardon is an interesting Constitutional question and all but it’s just that, noise. Pence will do the pardon. One can only hope that TRump gets caught up in NYS offenses that do not fall under the Federal pardon system. And/or that Pence himself also gets indicted. And Nancy Pelosi is Speaker. Call it a dream scenario. Keep in mind tho that the Kochs are dropping half a billion into the midterms...'
'Is this someone acting like Stewart in a Colbert rip-off show? First time I’ve heard of this show so yes, it’s a serious question..'
"You're missing the point. In what world does the president need to tell everyone--through Twitter no less!--that he can pardon himself? Why is a sitting president of the United States having to say such a thing?  \n\nThis might sound crazy, but that kind of attitude has even Mueller skeptics wondering if these are truly the words of an innocent man."
'It’s not like if an impeachment+conviction happens, Roberts won’t swear-in Pence immediately, just as their constitutional duty would compel them to...\n\nThe military and Secret Service also swear oaths to uphold the *constitution* of the United States. One would hope, in a constitution usurpation-by-Cheeto scenario, that the military and SS would stand by their oaths and begin following orders in the new chain of command. \n\nA simple executive order from Pence, directing the SS to remove the Trumps from the White House premises would suffice at that point.\n\nThe concern shouldn’t be “whether or not Trump will resist”... the concern should be whether or not Congress has the jewels to do it. It’s a real possibility that 2018 could see the Blue-wave come up short of being able to impeach or convict and a 2020 election goes to Trump as well if more voter suppression and apathy holds strong. \n\nIf that happens, it’s still Congress who’s the problem... and Congress is a reflection of the people, even if skewed.\n\nIt’s almost as if *we the people* may not deserve anything better than what we’re collectively getting!'
'But there was never any surety there would be a Pardon, in fact it was part of a Grand bargain made between the Dem and GOP. \nAt the time of Watergate,Spiro Agnew, the VP resigned, so the VP spot was vacant. If it was not filled and Nixon resigned, the third in line, the Speaker of the House, Carl Albert, a Democrat from Oklahoma, would become President\n\nThis was just 14 months after Nixon had crushed George McGovern in a Landslide, so having a Dem take over the Presidency would not go over well with the GOP anf the Dems were afraid Nixon would stay and fight impeachment. To get Nixon out of office, the Dems agreed to approve Gerald Ford to be the Vice President, over the GOP choice, Nelson Rockefeller. \n\nWhile there was never a deal to Pardon Nixon, the fact that he would face numerous indictments, face a long trial and maybe  even Prison time. ford decided to pardon Nixon. It also killed any chance of Ford winning the next term, the pardon was really unpopular and Jimmy Cater won the Presidency over Ford in the next election.\n\nThere were many who said that Pence was picked to Pardon Trump, while pence is a politician, he has little ambition for the Presidency.'

"It's amazing how much stuff went on in that campaign, yet Trump says he knows nothing about any of it. I think Trump must have spent the whole campaign out of the room making coffee for himself whilst all his top level staff had these conversations about these sensitive Russian matters. \n\nAlso, he expects people to believe that his son and his son-in-law both had meetings with Russians, yet neither of them spoke to him about anything that was discussed, even though they were working for him and his campaign. What did they talk about at dinner? Ivanka? The weather? \n\nThe problem is that Trump's supporters believe all his tweets about fake news, and the media being against him. All the time they are supporting him they won't believe anything that contradicts him. They have gone all-in on supporting Trump and do not ever want to admit they are wrong to have done that. "

It\'s not like Exxon just walks up and hands Mr candidate a bag of cash. \n\nThe trouble is that groups of "concerned citizens" have a right to raise contributions to campaign on behalf of a preferred candidate/agenda. It\'s a little murkier to legislate speech of ostensibly private organizations. What exactly constitutes speech that needs to be limited? These people don\'t work for a political campaign. They don\'t even necessarily push candidates. We need to be incredibly careful about limits on political speech. I could see a government dominated by someone like Trump going crazy if we break this seal.\n\n**Luckily we don\'t have to start from scratch**. There were stronger limits in place before an insane decision by the Supreme Court in 2010 (Citizens United) which opened the door for what we now call "Super PACs". I can say that speech was ok before this, I don\'t remember any gummint goons coming to beat me for speaking out. I believe this decision should be overturned and the rules re-instated. They were kind of loose, but they were tested for decades. Definitely better than nothing!\n\n[Citizens United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC#Political_impact).

'The Electoral College was created in part to keep a crook from becoming president, and we see how well that worked.\n\nEDIT: \n\n> As Alexander Hamilton writes in “The Federalist Papers,” the Constitution is designed to ensure “that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications.” The point of the Electoral College is to preserve “the sense of the people,” while at the same time ensuring that a president is chosen “by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice.”'

"So far, we still have elections. And in 2018, the country will have a chance to make Congress Democratically-controlled.\n\nThere are large areas of the country where people are still not voting (see the thread about Texas); canvassing, registering people to vote, and actively engaging the electorate *does* make a difference.\n\nThe benefit we have is history; so long as we know it, and recognize it, we can work to not repeat it. People are more savvy, for instance, when it comes to crooked political administrations; Nixon taught us that corruption can go as high as the WH, and firing people investigating you (as Trump is now doing), is one of the surest signs. And now, papers like *The Washington Post* and *The New York Times* are hiring more investigative journalists and doing round-the-clock work, keeping tabs on the WH.\n\nDon't despair. :)"
'While a great idea in theory, I believe it would be massively flawed in the US.

'Yeah i agree! It would be hilarious seeing the person that tried getting tackled by the secret service.'
"It is so obviously the answer, and it has hope because it doesn't offend the ordinary citizen; the trouble with it is it puts you up against those with the power, those who make the decisions, those with the money. But that is good for us because there is no moral objection warring this corrupt political evil.\nSo, it's the realest and most agreeable fight we could ask for, especially since the rich can be more easily swayed as we can show them that they can still have every material possession they want if we just work together; whereas for instance it's harder to convince someone with different ideologies, religious etc."
"I actually would abolish the corporation. it's sole purpose is growth, at the expense of everything else.\n\nit's absurd to me that companies have more money and power than many small countries.\n\nsince there is no way corporations will be outlawed, I would at least like to see a law put I  place that no individual in any company can make more than 25 times* more that any other individual working in that company.\n\nif the CEO believes they are worth $10 million/year, then no one else can earn less than $400,000/year.\n\nor, put another way, in the janitor cleaning the toilets is only worth $25,000/year, the CEO can't make more than $625,000/year\n\n*25 times may be too generous, maybe 10 or 20 times is a better number.\n\nthere is simply no way anyone is worth that much more than anyone else."

'The FBI is conducting the investigation. Mueller is the Special Council.\n\nThe FBI knows everything he knows and they will appoint another Special Counselor.'
'Tl;dr: someone else takes over the investigation, possible protests, possible Democrat political gains, a probable impeachment but probably not for a very long time.\n\nFor the longer version:\n\nBack during the Nixon Investigation there was an event called the "Saturday Night Massacre." Nixon wanted to fire the special prosecutor Archibald Cox, so he gave orders to the attorney general to do so. The attorney general resigned instead, as did the deputy attorney general. Eventually Nixon found a guy in the chain who would do what he asked, the solicitor general.\n\nFollowing that, for the first time polls showed that more Americans supported impeaching Nixon than opposed. Faith in the office of the presidency plummeted, and to this day Nixon is seen as proof of how far a crook can get in American politics. Most mark this as the official beginning of the end of Nixon\'s presidency (he resigned... 9 months later)\n\nThat\'s the historical precedent. Now for the Trump/Mueller situation specifically.\n\nIf Trump fires Mueller, he effectively admits that he is afraid of Mueller\'s findings. Likely a number (maybe not very many, but a few) officials will resign in protest. Further, it won\'t end the investigation, it just means someone else will have to be brought in.\n\nCurrently there are already local protests planned to take place across the country if Mueller is fired. This may cause a social and economic impact to the country, depends on how well Americans can be coordinated to protest and how much political will they have.\n\nRepublicans will have to weigh the costs of standing by Trump. Considering a Trump impeachment that also takes down Pence will allow for a Ryan presidency, the Republicans would have a self-interested motive to support impeachment. In all probability, they would continue to hold out for the results of the investigation. \n\nLong term, confidence in the American government takes a huge hit, both domestically and internationally. Honestly, that ship has already sailed, but this would be like soaking that ship in gasoline and then firing flaming arrows at it.\n\nNixon, in his case, got to stay president for 9 more months. Trump would probably be in a similar situation. The T_D crowd would insist that the God Emperor totally just drained the swamp of a deep state operative like Mueller. The anti-Trump crowd have already reached critical outrage, at this point they can\'t really get much angrier, and its not feasible for them to enter a perpetual state of protest. Whatever centrists still kind of like Trump would probably turn against him, which would do nothing to him but would likely help the Democrats gain seats in congress.\n\nAnd, maybe historically we will see that as the beginning of the end of Trump\'s presidency. But, I think history is going to decide that the beginning of the end was his inauguration.\n'

'Which brings up another great point given the current NATO situation and North Korea. If you’re really a patriot, if you really support the troops, you should be behind the alliance 100%. More so, you should support increasing peacetime deployments as a means of deterrence. Our military is fully voluntary, and yes they would rather be at home than overseas, but being deployed on a peace mission is far more preferable and cheaper, be it economically, emotionally, mentally, and in terms of the human cost, than being deployed on a mission of war. Standing with our allies and supporting them is the biggest influence we can have toward keeping our troops safe, and keeping their families together. - Me, EM3 USN Ret'

Now when polling is that far off there tends to be different sized pockets so that if 4 states flipped, maybe one of them was won inside the circle of the automatic recount, but the others would fall farther outside of that radius.

'I think she reminds a lot of people of the annoying, overbearing girl in high school who was in the National Honor Society and who was the captain of the debate team, who always had all the stats pertaining to every issue crunched out beforehand, and who seemed to think that everyone who didn\'t agree with her one-hundred percent was just a hopeless idiot.\n\nOn top of that, I think that deep down -- and whether for better or for worse -- that\'s *really who she is*. I think her innermost self was revealed when she came out with that health care plan back in 1993, during her husband\'s first term. She devised it in a vacuum and figured it all out on paper -- by crunching out all of the stats, of course -- and apparently, didn\'t see why it shouldn\'t just be rolled out and implemented the way she wrote it down.\n\nIn other words, she didn\'t want to start out conservatively by improving or expanding some existing structure and using that as a proof of concept for something larger, or by making a law or two that was aimed at remedying some particular and egregious problem, rather, she thought she should just be able to roll out an all-encompassing, sweeping reform of the health care system overnight because she had worked out the numbers, and they all seemed to make sense on paper.\n\nStill, I think that almost as many people don\'t like her simply because of what she represents as a woman who evidently doesn\'t personally accept the traditional roles that are assigned to women. By having a career and by seeming as though she derives her identity from that more than she derives her identity from her role as a wife or as a mother, she is a walking, breathing repudiation of many American people\'s value systems. She doesn\'t even need to mention anything about it specifically in order for some people to feel antagonized by her, and so when she says [things that might seem to even partially betray her hostility towards traditional ideas of womanhood](https://youtu.be/68OBqcON9o0), then that\'s all the confirmation that such people will ever need.\n\nTrump, on the other hand -- when placed beside her -- was more like a dumb, loud-mouthed, arrogant and entitled jock or would-be frat boy who didn\'t know shit about fuck, but who always knew the *exact right moment* to shout something like "SAN DIMAS HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL RULES!!!" in order to generate raucous cheers and thunderous applause.

'To translate the headline into an actual statement: \n\nTwo attorneys think it’s possible to indict trump. Not that it’s imminent or for certain, but that it’s legally possible. \n\nIf you want to get into the jurisprudence on all of this, and get a head start on the arguments that would spawn from such a move by Mueller, the left will be all for it and the right will say that the chief executive, whose role in government is to enforce the law, can’t be indicted. How could you enforce the law if you’re in prison?\n\nSome will agree with the right (looking at you Clarence) and most will not. It’ll go to the Supreme Court to be resolved. \n\nSome will argue under the guise of originalism that impeachment was the only remedy to get rid of a corrupt or criminal public official, while some will argue that the founders never intended for anyone to be above the law, and they’ll cite pre-constitution writings discussing how the revolution took place to get rid of a tyrant who thought he was above the law. \n\nIt will be the most significant Supreme Court case of our lifetimes and god forbid Trump gets to appoint another right wing judicial activist to the court any time soon.

"Trump. Pence would be a run of the mill republican who might try to push through some weird social conservative shit, but he will still act within the confines of the law and our democracy. The damage Pence could accomplish is akin to that of George W. Bush.\n\nTrump is an outlier that we've never seen before in our lifetimes. He doesn't value democracy or even try to pander to it. Democracy is the government for the common man. Someone who is born into riches has no need for democracy. They can buy the best lawyers, the best health care, they can influence those in power. Not all people born into money devalue democracy, but Trump certainly does. He views it as a chore, a road block to getting things done quickly. Try and find one speech where Trump even mentions the word 'democracy.' I'm sure they're out there, I'm sure you could count on one hand the amount of times.\n\nSomeone who values western democracy and our institutions wouldn't attack the press, the FBI, the judiciary, the intelligence community. They wouldn't cozy up to foreign despots while handing 'bills' to our allies for perceived money owed. They wouldn't suggest taking people's guns and dealing with due process later.\n\nTrump is far more dangerous because if he had it his way he would be president for life. And when he died maybe Ivanka or Jared would take over. Then maybe Baron. And Baron's children. And when you throw someone like that into the most powerful position in the world during a time of extreme economic hardship between the great recession and increased automation taking jobs, people are less inclined to question him because 'he's getting stuff done.'

"The investigation is ongoing. A premature impeachment by Congress without the evidence that is being marshaled by Mueller is reckless. Mueller is thorough, meticulous even, deliberate, and is conducting a thorough investigation. This can't be rushed, unless we want a shoddy job done. We have 35 indictments so far, and a number of guilty pleas. This is Mueller setting up the board.

That is, it's aimed to make sure that the next ultra crooked president won't need to face scrutiny and resignation by making his support stronger than ever, which in turn would make even some of GOP's fairer senators reluctant to go against Trump unless they truly want to sacrifice their career.\n\nAnd it's both working and not working. Trump's 38-41% support is stupidly high for such an insane public figure, in part thanks to Hannity and the other servile servants, but he actually only had like 18% of ultra strong support, which would've fit more in other country with pragmatic view of their leader like France.

'I am not a lawyer, but I suspect not.  They weren\'t destroying anything.  Rather, they were *probably* preparing to give an incomplete response to a subpoena or request to produce the e-mails.\n\nBut because Mueller never gave the request, we don\'t know the exact wording of what that request (or subpoena) would have said, thus, we can\'t specifically say that the Trump folks tried to hide anything.  (edit: that said, if members of the Trump circles/administration *actually discussed hiding stuff* (which they appear to be stupid enough to actually talk about) and Mueller has that via "wire taps", turned insiders or other means, then yes, that would be evidence of obstruction.)\n\nIt would have been interesting to see how Mueller\'s team would have approached such a request/subpoena.  To us on the outside (particularly on this sub), we infer that Mueller has many angles of likely criminal activity that they are investigating, most of which pass through the transition period/team, but the request/subpoena would have had to have some specific legal basis around which the request/demand would be framed.  It would have been interesting to see how they formed that to see what they are focusing on, and what they aren\'t tipping their hand on.\n\n(There\'s also the factor of FISA and other "wire tap" warrants, so there may be communications within the Trump folks that they have through that route, which they wouldn\'t need to request/subpoena in a circumstance like this.  They could potentially be intentionally not requesting some records (which they have through other channels) because the players here are stupid enough to think they are succeeding in covering stuff up.)'

Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, called Mueller “a great selection” with “impeccable credentials.” Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said the former FBI chief “has a strong reputation for independence, and comes with the right credentials for this job.” Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado said Mueller had “an incredible reputation.” “It’s the right decision,” he said Thursday morning at an event hosted by The Atlantic. “Let’s get the facts, let’s get the information, and let us proceed with all haste.”\n\nWhat a change of tune. '
"Mueller will do his job, and nothing more.\n\nPartisan bullshit will not affect him doing what he must... but it will affect how some view his work. Voters have to act because there are already those who are trying to make this look like some grand anti-conservative conspiracy. The reality is it's government checking and balancing. We are in the midst of a constitutional crisis, so we must take the side of law and order. You have to punish individuals at the voting booth because grand Anti-GOP language will embolden propaganda outlets.\n\nWe look to Mueller not because he is liberal, or a champion for democracy, or a counter to Trumpism. We look to Mueller because he best represents the law. He is already one of the best lawmen in our nation's history, and this is one more task he is undertaking. Regardless what the outcome is, we must respect his teams findings.\n\nConstitution first, all else afterwards."
"Excuse my millering this thread, but what in the world is with the radio silence regarding the purported meeting between Trump's lawyers and Mueller's team? Did a meeting take place? When?\n\nAnd, most curious of all, why has the media been totally silent after so much was written about the meeting during the **days before**? "
"Honest question: Have Trump and other Repubs done anything other than tweet or comment to the press about Mueller? How does having an opinion undermine anything from a legal perspective? Also, I thought Trump couldn't fire Mueller, just the guy who appointed him."
'What consequences? The title leads one to believe there is an argument for consequences to be levied on people who are "crusading" against Muellerin a so-called partisan attack but the article doesn\'t address this idea at all. There is, however, a lot of the "pot calling the kettle black" and obsequious fawning over Mueller in the article written by a sycophant. (It\'s getting so over-the-top I bet I could hang a "ice cream machine" sign over his ass and people would still buy it and eat it up.) Trump won\'t fire Mueller, he\'s not even building up to it, he doesn\'t need to. You may wish and hope he does so you can fulfill your "obstruction of justice" fantasy, but that\'s not what will happen here. '
"I love Mueller and I love President Trump! I can't wait for him to finish up and clear this whole mess up!"
"woah, I love watching *Frontline* but haven't seen it in a while as I no longer have a tv, thanks for the reminder, looks like you can find it online. "
'I keep hoping one morning I\'ll wake up to Donald Trump speaking like an adult, behind him a seemingly endless train of purp walks as FBI agents cuff and stuff every treasonous motherfucker in Congress. \n\n"My fellow Americans, I deeply apologize for the misdirection over the last year, but I\'ve been working with the intelligence community since the Russians contacted my campaign. It was necessary to act as a honeypot so as to fully root it all out. This is what I meant by draining the swamp. And to my supporters, I would just like to say \'if you were really on board with this you need to get some help, here\'s a number to call ...\'"\n\nI mean ... that\'s is *supposed* to be a believable thing for the American president in a completely fucked up situation like this. Right? That\'s *supposed to be who the president is*\n\nIt\'s so devistating to know beyond a shadow of a doubt that absolutely nothing of the sort is the case. Trump, and his entire administration and pretty much all of the GOP leadership led us like lambs to the slaughter and give zero fucks about that. Even after they plead guilty. They will still give zero fucks.'
"Fox was just waiting there for a juicy story to endlessly discuss and the Justice department gave them one with the FBI text messages released. Now the same department releases more emails from the Wiener investigation laptop hoping it will stir more discussions. I don't really understand why they feel releasing these partial pieces of an smear are doing anything helpful. If you're not going to investigate with the things you release and you're not releasing any statements with reasons on why you're releasing them, you're just causing a ruckus. \n\nI don't think Mueller's team can go on for more than three months more if they keep releasing smear evidence and don't get scrutinized for why they release this stuff.  "
'Good on you.\n\nEven if you 100% support Trump you should never be against a professional like Mueller investigating him. If Trump is clean then nothing will come up.'
'The “fake” dossier was actually legal opposition research. Yes you read that right Russian trolls, legal document just like don jr was setting up meetings looking for “dirt” on Hillary. Was that illegal too? Also despite the fact that the fbi was investigating the trump campaign 6 months or more before the dossier was even reported. \n\nHell trump knew about the Russian interference because the FBI TOLD him and his campaign way before the dossier. Love how treasonous idiots love to mess with timelines to create their own revisions of history. '
"So what's the 2018 vote looking like for you?\n\nHave they gone far enough that you're willing to vote against the party? Or will it be case by case?\n\nI'm genuinely curious. "
"I'm independent. Voted Obama 08 then Johnson then President Trump! I'll take no blame but I do love MUELLER! LOVE THIS SUB! I am so excited to see what he finds!"
'Guys, correct me if I’m wrong - has there been any reports suggesting Mueller is chasing TD?  Thus far, it appears Mueller Time is laser focused on Putin’s network of influence.\n\nDon’t misinterpret what I’m asking.  To me, the scope really looks more focused on Putin’s meddling with a byproduct of rounding up scum like Manafort, amongst others.\n\nI guess my point is - I’m prepared for TD to walk away from this as bodies lie in his wake.  Then hope his wife embarrasses him by serving him with divorce papers while still in office.\n\nAm I out to lunch on this?\n'
'Is it just me or does he look like he aged a good 5+ years in the last six months?'
"Trump supporters keep saying the Dossier has been proven false but has ANYTHING in the Dossier been proven false? I understand some things have not been varified 100% but somethings in their have been proven true. I haven't heard of a single thing in  their proven to be false. I am legitimately curious to know."
'Oh my fucking word, please be true'
"Well, we know that Trump can only pardon Cohen for federal crimes. We also know that Mueller has some amount of sway with the State of New York's AG office. I think we can safely assume that Cohen's been up to shady business that probably constitutes some state crimes. So . . . if you're Michael Cohen, you have two choices:\n\n1) Hope notoriously self-centered backstabber Donald Trump swoops in to save you from federal criminal charges. This will not save you from state criminal charges and it will not save you from being subpoenaed by Mueller or Congress to answer for your role in those federal crimes.\n\n2) Throw yourself on the mercy of Robert Mueller and beg for as much immunity as he can possibly give you. This is your best chance to avoid any jail time whatsoever.\n\nThe choice is pretty easy if you ask me."
'Hopefully Cohen is wearing a wire from Mueller when he listens to the offers from Trump. That would be perfect. "Look Cohen, just don\'t say anything to Mueller and I\'ll take care of everything."'
"Just you wait, Trump will pull his 4D chess moves. Maybe he'll be safer locked up when the bombs drop, perhaps it'll guarentee he dosen't do any military service (despite being 72) in any capacity and make him a low priority target.\n\n\nWhen the people of America crawl out the ashes of their once great country they will have no choice but to exonerate him as supreme leader eternal\n\nEDIT: I seriously underestimated the age of the soon to be supreme leader."
"We don't care if Cohen talks, because Trump did nothing wrong, so this investigation should be shut down immediately!  By following long and poorly concealed chains of evidence, Mueller has sprawled way too far beyond his original mandate to investigate evidence!  This man who never talks to the press is only doing this for publicity!\n\nDoublethink is fun"

"What good would that do currently?  Pretty sure Mueller can't request he be sent to him."
'That was the old Ecuadorean demand. It has changed and they have not listed that as a demand and are preparing to remove his asylum & sanctuary at the Embassy. the reason? Ecuador has a new President, and the US has threatened to oppose a new World Bank loan to Ecuador that they really need. A majority of the funding banks of the World Bank are in the US, and if thye do not participate and it had to go elsewhere to other banks the loan would have a lot more interest. So money talks and Assange walks. But actually if Assange had to go to the US, now is his best time, as he now has a large bargaining chip; what he knows about the Russian use of Wikileaks and his communications with the Trump campaign, the Russian GRU and, of course, the "off the books" people helping both parties. This alone is liable to give Assange a walk if he cooperates with Mueller\'s investigation.'
'That’s a great point and something i hadn’t even considered. I need to re-evaluate my position on this whole thing. '
'Not actually a bot, but understand how it could look that way and difficult to prove I’m not. I post here and r/politicalhumor because you are right I don’t  have the knowledge to post more constructive/in depth pieces in r/politics or r/RussiaLago (my preference would have been Tsar-a-Largo but I wasn’t consulted).  Are my posts politically charged and binary? Yes I suppose they are, the alt-right used such memes to great effect to undermine democracy, so maybe some push back will help restore it too! It is a binary world now anyway patriots and people who believe in the rule of law vs traitors, simple as that. This post was only mean’t to express my personal hope that slimeball Farage (who is certainly in the mix here) gets his comeuppance too, or at least that he is worrying about getting it. This thread does seemed to have veered into Assange bashing and speculation as to his involvement in this whole affair. My personal feeling on Assange is that maybe he started off wanting to leak info for honest/good faith purposes but it’s pretty obvious now he has been working for the Kremlin. Why no WikiLeaks about Putin’s dirty laundry? No only leak info damaging to Western Democracies, because that’s how you’ll change things for the better 🤔'

Judging by your reply, it’s having great results. '
'Even more narrowly than that. You can prove an explicit quid pro quo, [but if it is not an "official act" it still isnt considered bribery](https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-supreme-courts-bribery-blessing-mcdonnell-decision).\n\n>Technically, the Court held that selling an “official act” can be still illegal. But it also held that the McDonnell jury heard a definition of that term that was too broad. **Something as subtle—or unsubtle—as an executive calling up an aide and telling her to listen to his very good friend, or taking a check and then having a quiet word with regulators, or even a directive that an influence-buyer should be helped in every way does not constitute an official act, at least not on its own, the Court found.** Instead, according to the opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts, an official act "must involve a formal exercise of governmental power that is similar in nature to a lawsuit before a court, a determination before an agency, or a hearing before a committee.” In other words, if no gavel is involved, it will probably be hard to prove bribery, after this ruling. Indeed, the few politicians whom prosecutors may be able to convict are those who are careless enough to put together corruption to-do lists, since, according Roberts, a test of whether something is a bribable official act is whether it is "the kind of thing that can be put on an agenda, tracked for progress, and then checked off as complete."\n\n'
"Fortunately when it comes to foreign money and influence the law is very clear and hasn't been narrowly interpreted by the supreme court."
"It's because we haven't stopped doing what the government wants, giving them taxes without accountability of where it could go.\nWe literally pay governors to be swayed by local businesses into changing tax laws in favour of a better tax rate, all while the warehouse workers are stuck at the bus stop, waiting for the bus that takes 45 mins to get there.\nPeople are too fucking compliant, even small business owners are riding their employees because they know there is nothing else in this world other than what you take from it.\nThe voting process has started the change, but I wouldn't expect the next politicians to have it all figured out, like all of them right now."

"Although the photos are difficult to make out, the bald man could potentially be Ahmed Al-Rumaihi. A former Qatari diplomat, who heads up part of a Qatari Investment Authority in the US, and may possibly have connections with the Royal family. This is where things go from downright bizarre to interesting.   \n\n* Last month Ice Cube and a business partner filed litigation against Al-Rumaihi and other defendants, over fallout from investment in their a sports venture. The filing is in Avenatti's hometown of LA.\n* The substance of the case has nothing to do with politics - there are some interesting topics raised in the court filings however.  \n* It's alleged that Al-Rumaihi and the QIA is a front for a PR influence campaign directed on the behalf of the Qatari government. That this specific investment, amongst others known, were for the purposes of raising a more positive image of Qatar in the US.\n* One of the sports league founders (Jeff Kwatinetz) worked with Steve Bannon in a previous career. This is publicly available knowledge according to him. Kwatinetz claims they are still friends, despite having differing political views.\n* Kwatinetz claims that during their deals, Al-Rumaihi *repeatedly* asked him to set up a meeting between Bannon, Al-Rumaihi, the Qatari government. Al-Rumaihi allegedly said that they would underwrite all of Bannon's political efforts in return for his support of Qatar.\n* Kwatinetz stated he rebuffed this, and court filings document the reply as: *'Mr. Al Rumaihi laughed and then stated to me that I shouldn't be naive, that so many Washington politicians take our money, and stated 'do you think Flynn turned down our money?’'*\n* Note that Avenatti made effort to ensure Flynn was pictured here.\n* Note also the extensive allegations of foreign and corporate money ending up in Michael Cohens supposed slush fund.\n* If this is indeed Al-Rumaihi photographed at Trump Tower, that would be months before any of the above occurred. Subsequently, Mike Flynn would be fired. Trump would veer towards the Saudis. The blockade becomes increasingly strenuous for the Qataris. They need a new man on the inside of the Trump White House to be their advocate, someone like Bannon.\n* The coincidences don't stop here.\n* In one particularly tense moment, Kwatinetz claims Al-Rumaihi threatened him, saying 'You don't know who I know in LA and what they're capable of'. \n* In November 2017 the New Yorker broke the story that Harvey Weinstein used private israeli intelligence agency Black Cube to suppress allegations that he had sexually harassed or assaulted numerous women.\n* Last week The Guardian broke the story that people associated with the Trump campaign used 'an Israeli private intelligence agency' to smear Obama officials involved with the Iran nuclear deal. \n* The Qatar Investment Authority owned Miramax films, a company started by Harvey Weinstein and his brother.  \n* In December 2013, Miramax and the Weinstein Company signed a 20-year deal for future cooperation.\n\nPhotos of Ahmed Al-Rumaihi can be found [here](http://tmz.vo.llnwd.net/o28/newsdesk/tmz_documents/2018.04.05%20Final%20Complaint.pdf) in the court filing.

Trump really doesn't have much cash on hand, despite the fact that he paid $400million **in cash** in the last 10 years, for some dodgy real estate deals, like the 2 golf courses in Europe for which he already had to pay $100million extra just to keep them afloat. That seems to imply that Trump really is incapable to properly manage his money. \n\n 3. This slush fund serves just to pay for things that Trump needs to pay for, but which the world should never have found out about, like hush money. Thus: Stormy Daniels  was not an exception, but the rule."
'Not defending these corrupt assholes but if you have lots of money, it’s not in cash. Their net worth is tied up in investments. Having cash = losing money because of inflation. Selling investments to pay off a lump sum would often involve taxes and missed investment gains, so leveraging debt can actually make you more money vs paying a lump sum of cash. A mortgage has a low interest rate, and anyone can make 7% after inflation in the stock market. So if you had a $100k cash and a $100k mortgage at 4% it’s actually better to keep paying the mortgage over time and invest the cash. You’ll offset the cost of your mortgage interest and profit with the rest. '

There are many moving parts, foreign players, and international laws to contend with. The Mueller case is many layers deep and multifaceted from money laundering and tax evasion to espionage and maybe even human trafficking. Trust me, I’m as antsy as you to see Mueller take down the whole Trump organization and everyone connected to its shady dealings, but good things come to those who wait, and I have complete faith in Mueller to follow the letter of the law so that the charges will stick. Nobody is getting off on a technicality. '
'For anyone who is unfamiliar, here\'s the brief summary of the strategy for the US:\n\n> Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke "Afro-American racists". Russia should "introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics".'

'A great example of what Pres. Obama was talking about with Letterman -- Fox News viewers live on a totally different planet from everyone else. '
"The New York times article called this, they said the subpoena was likely to get Bannon to agree to a less formal interview, which he now did. If he was being subpoenaed, why did they want him to agree to anything, couldn't he just be dragged to the grand jury testimony?"
'Bannon is like the Christian ethnostate version of Samuel L in Kingsmen\n\n"These racial tensions... are a fever.  Don\'t you agree we need more white blood cells?"'
'*rift\n\nBut if this is true this would be a way more complex degree of planning than any of them have shown themselves capable of'
"Nope but the subpoena was to appear before a grand jury. This way he only has to meet with Mueller and his team and likely have his attorney in the room with him while he's answering questions. It's likely Mueller will have GJ on standby should he refuse to answer or answer in such a way that is less than satisfactory to the investigators."
'Bannon refused to meet with Mueller. Grand jury issues subpoena compelling testimony in front of them. Bannon backs down and agrees to meet with the special counsel. Won’t be in front of GJ but I’m sure that option is still on the table. '
'Careful, the right has convinced people telling the truth it "condescending."'
'I’d just like to point out that he said “People that watch Fox News are on an entirely different planet than people that listen to NPR.” It’s a similar point, but he acknowledged that there are extremes on both sides, which is pretty important, I think.\n\nEdit: Everybody is pointing out that NPR is not extreme, I guess I could have worded that better. And maybe his point was that the propaganda is more heavily influencing the right, I’m not sure. The core of the topic at that point in the show, though, was that there is not a single set of facts that everybody is working from. Every news outlet has a different take, and headlines are so influential nowadays that it has become a problem.'
"The advantage of getting him in a meeting with investigators is they have the ability to use the information a bit more broadly, and use it to lay traps - basically, you have more time to use it (not to mention a cooperative witness is much more appealing than a hostile one). When you drag someone in front of a Grand Jury, you're forcing them to testify on the record. Worse, Bannon can't plead anything but the 5th in front of a GJ - the chance of getting caught in a lie is far higher (and with much higher consequences) in front of a GJ.\n\nOf course, he can still be dragged in front of a GJ and forced to give the same testimony. "
'I hope he ends up answering questions in front of a grand jury. He’s not going to put up with this texting the White House on whether or not to answer. '

"People need to dispel the JB (James Bond, Jason Bourne, Jack Bauer) ideas about intelligence organizations.  There isn't some Masonic-like initiation wherein one day an individual is a person-of-interest, and the next, they're a fully compromised asset, intentionally betraying their country.  Recruitment of assets is one of the most valuable of crafts in the intelligence world, and the level of effort and patience devoted is often proportional to the potential payoff.\n\nIn the late 80's every westerner visiting the Soviet Union was under close surveillance.  Most hotels had a room that the KGB used to question guests.  A quasi-famous real-estate mogul from NY, that's married a Czech former-model, would most certainly received an approach.  For a man like Turmp, a little flattery probably went a long, long way."
'Read "Collusion" by Luke Harding. It\'s quite clear that Russia has been actively perusing Trump since the 80s at least. They potentially have compromat dating back decades. There\'s not much of a question at this point.'
'Then he succeeded admirably. '
"What if people just accepted that Trump was elected President despite the fact the Trump is an idiot (and also ignorant) and stopped acting as if he is a Super spy just because it suits your political cause? \n\nRussia didn't cause the problems in your country... It is very typical that US citizens, including democrats, blame foreigners for their own problems.  Also, your countries' problems existed long before Trump. Start looking in the mirror, President Trump is a reflection of your society. \n\n"
'"Those Soviet Union people said they liked my suit. One day when im too fucking old i\'ll  become US President and be a god damn Nazi so I can tear down this stupid fucking country. It\'ll be great. You should see it. Wonderful people."'
'If only he were putting it out there in a more coherent, reputable, long-form medium than Twitter. I’m not saying he’s not doing God’s work, it’s just there have got to be either more efficient or more effective ways of spreading the Gospel.'
"I'm pretty sure that when it's time for all the books to be written on this, he'll only have to sew together his tweet threads, and he'll be one of the fist to market. Until then, 1) There is no real motivation for him to dole it out in larger pieces 2) Tweeting is a very convenient and easily digestible format for a fast moving story. "
"Came here to say this. Very interesting read and well researched. The book doesn't make any accusations or connections just presents the facts as they are and lets the reader draw their own conclusions. From what I have read Trump is an asset and he doesn't even realise it."
"**Foundations of Geopolitics**\n\nThe Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia is a geopolitical book by Aleksandr Dugin. The book has had a large influence within the Russian military, police, and foreign policy elites and it has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Its publication in 1997 was well-received in Russia and powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian fascist and nationalist who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.Dugin credits General Nikolai Klokotov of the Academy of the General Staff as co-author and main inspiration, though Klokotov denies this.

"Her ties go through Russian businessmen moving to israel for Israeli citizenship. Both russia and America have a no extradition clause for Israel. Given Israel's desire for funding and business their tax codes promote these Russians to go there. Since America doesn't make AIPAC and its offshoots that bleed into the NRA, some having the same boards and members, register as foreign agents or prove the money didn't come from Israel, Russians can dump money into trumps pocket unchecked. Russia is using Israel to get to us and the NRA is happy to oblige. \n\n>In an effort to attract successful people and their money, the authorities took a no-questions-asked attitude to the source of the funds. More recently, the success of Israeli technology companies has also made the country a viable destination for legitimate investment. The oligarchs, for their part, have increasingly sought out potential boltholes in case they fall out with the government back home.\n\n>\nBesides the warm welcome from officialdom, another of Israel’s attractions for the oligarchs is physical security. Many of them travel the world with bodyguards, looking over their shoulders for hit-men or polonium in their tea. It is never referred to publicly, but there is an understanding that Russia’s intelligence services do not challenge their Israeli counterparts by carrying out hits in Israel. “There haven’t been any assassinations here, that’s enough,” was all one senior official would say.\n\n>\nIsraeli law-enforcement officials have raised concerns that lax tax rules have created a pipeline for money-laundering. Last month the finance ministry tried to convince the cabinet to adopt its proposal to cancel a ten-year exemption from reporting foreign income and assets that immigrants and returning Israeli expatriates enjoy. (They would still have been exempted from paying tax on their foreign income.) The immigration minister, Ze’ev Elkin, blocked the plan. He insists that the exemption is not there to attract the oligarchs, who have their pick of friendly tax jurisdictions elsewhere.\n\nhttps://www.economist.com/business/2015/09/17/welcome-to-the-promised-land"
"Oh please sweet Jesus let them go down in flames already! When I worked at Infocision in the political department selling NRA memberships and asking for donations to them as well, it was just so slimy and wrong. I couldn't do it, conning little old ladies out of their money to go to the NRA, and the scripts were insane(and were written with help and approval of the client). After the shootings in Parkland and Vegas, that was the line and I quit. Best decision I've ever made for my mental well-being. Fuck that place, I wonder how much they pull in for the NRA every year. I worked in the office at one point and learned that 80% of Infocisions income is from the NRA. Crazy."
"NRA loves running their mouths...if they aren't commenting you know its BAD!"
'Give the Fresh Air episode a listen. Was put up today, if NRA took money from Russia through a third party it might be traceable to the Trump campaign. That’s truly disturbing.'

"Shit, the NRA used to be a champion of rights, they have a positive history with the Civil Rights Movement, but shit changes.

"The article says the nra officials met with the wife of the rich Russian that has vested financial interests in arms manufacturing. This rich Russian guy has ties to this suspected spy via an arms orginaisation in Russia. It doesn't appear that the nra officials have any direct contact with this suspected spy other than a donation made from the organization this suspected spy belongs to. Theres no direct link to any russian activity. Of course the nra wants contributions from this rich russian arms manufacturer. Im generally a liberal when it comes to most things but the right to bear arms is a fundamental liberty of our people and this artical looks like a blatant attempt to undermine that liberty by making this organization look like theyre directly associated with evil Russian boogeymen. Not saying I think the nra is perfect, but I don't think this has anything to do with them. It's more about getting the average American to become alienated with their most basic rights. Like, liberty is one of our most coveted values and lots of people are buying on to the idea that they should be restricted because their scared. That's the real Russian threat, make it look like your core values need to be restricted.  "
'That would definitely make the world a better place for the rest of us.'
'The leadership. And nationalize its offices to create a national service for firearms training and safe use of firearms, which is one of the only good things the NRA does'
'collusion is not treason. The law states that treason is when American citizen “levies war” against the government or gives “aid and comfort” to the nation’s enemies, and Russia is not technically an enemy of the United States. That means that charges of treason would not apply to this situation.\n\nedit: Collusion is not an actual criminal charge'
'It’s amazing, but right now, the only real threat to Putin on the face of this planet is Robert Mueller.\n\nWe all grew up watching movies, playing video games, and reading stories, in which the hero fights off great evil. It’s been an absurd preposition for a great long time that it was possible. People aren’t super human; soldiers die arbitrarily in war, police officers are prone to corruption and abuses of power, and good cops can die, and one could make a list of how many super heroes would really just die in real life.\n\nBut, here you have it: a man against the odds.\n\nIt’s amazing, but Mueller shows that the highest most powerful good humans do is this: the pursuit of truth.'
'Well, yeah! The whole "adoptions" thing was just putin flailing in retaliation to sanctions on his boiz. \n\nThe magnitsky sanctions are a big deal because if putin can\'t protect his cronies, do they really need him? Putin can\'t function without his cronies and knows this. '

"The adoption group is a facade, but this isn't new information ( except maybe mueller getting specifics on the sources of funding). This all was apparent back when kushner met with her and published his claims that she wasn't an agent of the Russian gov't and was interested in something about opening lines for U.S. to adopt Russian orphans. Trump, or his administration members will get there's, but it's not necessarily going to be quick and easy. I agree the headlines over hype it- my guess is to try and keep it in everyone's minds in case trump tries to quash it at some point, but who knows. "
"Russia has a lot of brilliant computer scientists and educate technological literacy pretty heavily. It's absolutely no surprise to me they run sophisticated subversion campaigns. I'm sure they are doing much more insiduous things than just this, and probably all around the world. It's not like it's difficult. At least compared to military or political strategies."

'In many of these transactions, the deal was a "quick-turnaround" all-cash deal which is highly suspicious in places like New York or London. These transactions in many instances were also well above market value (some as much as 300k extra). Being a seller of a property which is being used for money laundering is itself not a crime, but knowing about the crime and actively covering it up using the property is certainly a crime. I\'d recommend reading the article, it has a lot of good info in it. '
"Honest question because I don't know anything about money laundering -- but isn't that just chump change in the grand scheme of things? We're talking not over a couple million for one of these units, how much money can you realistically launder in these scenarios?"
'Lol. Yes. (Real lol) Oh Lordy I Hope There Are Tapes!'
"I am also certainly very ignorant of all this as well, but these all are adding up (of which, are just what we know of because they have already been directly or indirectly incriminated in these court riceedings, let alone all of those we don't yet know about) to at least fairly substantial amounts. My, again, completely ignorant guess is that Trump then could, in turn, make purchases with his now apparently legit money in ways which are either yet unknown because he won't disclose his tax records, and because they could likely be transacted overseas through Lord knows how many Ruskie shell companies on foreign jurisdictions, returning the money to the Russians in exchange for, well, all of this horseshit thus far. Not to mention that Russians could have interests in the outcome of Trump’s many dismantling of laws which benefit large American companies which hope to benefit from the now captured entities making up American regulatory bodies. The Russians could be leveraging these law changes and monopolistic mergers being allowed to happen in the stock exchanges. \n\nIn short, Russia pays Trump dirty money to then either male apparently legit purchases in Russia in exchange for favors by Russia. Or, Russia benefits from backroom deals done with bought politicians and mega corporations which inflated stocks which benefits Russian spenders, in exchange for favors to Trump. Or all of this is continually done on the basis of blackmail for things Russia has on Trump. And/or because Trump is, too, laundering money the other way around in Russia in some sort of fucked up Ponzi scheme of corruption/blackmail/laundering going in continual circles. \n\nIn, even shorter, I still actually don’t have any idea but this much business with this many powerful people from a country which is already implicated in election tampering by a foreign country is shady as all fuckout and I don’t like it one bit but I have faith that our savior, the Mueller will collate it all eventually and I’lll live to see the first federally imprisoned ex-president and the first unilaterally reversed legislative record after the fact. By the way, I used to be a republican, this excuse for a president is literally turning party voters on their ear. "
'I\'m sorry, I wasn\'t clear when I brought up the amount of money laundered. I wasn\'t trying to say "Oh well it\'s just a few mill here and there, big deal." I\'m wondering if it\'s realistic to assume that he made all or most of his money from laundering with those transactions being only a couple million per transaction. I have no idea how someone gets the money clean, but I assumed if you were laundering money you would want to make it worth your time, and I also assumed that the bigger the transaction, the more money you can launder through said transaction without raising red flags. But I don\'t know the slightest thing about finance or money laundering so I\'m just speculating based off what I\'ve seen from movies and TV shows.'

'> Not a "Trumpian" but the flip side is, any other person on the planet would be in jail or have lost their security clearance had they handled classified material the way in which clinton and her team did.\n\nHere\'s the portion of the FBI investigation press release at the conclusion of the investigation dealing with their recommendation to the DoJ, emphasis added:\n\n> In our system, the prosecutors make the decisions about whether charges are appropriate based on evidence the FBI has helped collect. Although we don’t normally make public our recommendations to the prosecutors, we frequently make recommendations and engage in productive conversations with prosecutors about what resolution may be appropriate, given the evidence. In this case, given the importance of the matter, I think unusual transparency is in order.\n\n> Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before bringing charges. There are obvious considerations, like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent. Responsible decisions also consider the context of a person’s actions, and how similar situations have been handled in the past.\n\n> In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. **All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here.**\n\n> To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions. But that is not what we are deciding now.\n\n> As a result, although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case.\n\n> I know there will be intense public debate in the wake of this recommendation, as there was throughout this investigation. What I can assure the American people is that this investigation was done competently, honestly, and independently.

"> Never forget that Trump was elected in the first place because GOP/Russian media was able to convince Bernie Supporters and other elements within the Democratic Party not to show at the polls.\n\ncan we stop with this bullshit divisive false narrative? there were two types of Bernie supporters: 1) progressive/left-leaning voters, who found Bernie best fit their ideologies, and 2) anti status quo voters, who just wanted something other than politics-as-usual. group 1 was the majority, and they overwhelmingly voted for Clinton in the general election. group 2 was a small minority, and they mostly scattered to the wind. some went to other parties, some stayed home. these group 2 people wouldn't have voted for Clinton regardless of how much misinformation they were subjected to, because she was way too establishment for them. and they were not a significant factor in determining the outcome of the election, anyway. other factors had MUCH greater impact.\n\nnow stop shitting on Bernie supporters.  they're not responsible for this, and all you're doing with this incessant vilification is pushing them out of the party."

"Fuck that Debbie W. Schultz bullshit. Yeah, Hillary may not be the gaping orange anus we have now, but that in no way means she or the Democratic Party deserved any votes from party members that don't approve of her policies and actions the party leadership took during the election.\n\nThe way the Democratic party behaved in the primaries lived up to almost every Republican allegation of corruption and dishonesty.

'I wouldn’t be surprised if the hostility being shown towards North Korea at this point causes Kim Jung Un to not visit the White House and turns that country away from seeking peace.

'Well, you’re talking about a president who refused to prepare for this meeting and the salutes a general of an enemy army. \n\nI’m not sure what you mean by “fuck it up severely” the same way trump doesn’t know what “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” means. I do think there’s almost zero chance of trump fucking up the cease fire but he’s so committed to calling this a win that he will undoubtedly say more nice things about Kim and undermine the sanctions in place against North Korea. He’ll probably fuck over South Korea (more than he already has) and create a world wide distrust of the American military as a stabilizing force in the world. \n\nSo, if South Korea can’t trust us and the North gets its economy moving and doesn’t draw down any of its military, who is South Korea going to look to for stability? \n\nChina\n\nIt’ll be interesting to see how this all unravels. '
'You\'re not screaming about "liburls" so I\'ll show the same courtesy here and discuss the issue instead of yelling and capslocking.\n\n\nNorth Korea is a huge problem, no sane person is going to argue that. The big problem here is the image of what he\'s doing. Take a look at the way past US presidents have treated the people and how our closest alies do the same. The president speaks as a leader, speaks to the people as a whole and even respects those who disagree. You have to do that, you\'re not the president of the republicans or the democrats, you\'re the president of the united states. A land where we support a person\'s right to free speech. \n\nTrump has not done that. He has actively waged war against free speech by calling news outlets that don\'t agree with him or paint him in the best light "fake news". This isn\'t someone claiming he had sex with his daughter, that could easily be called fake news. This is him attacking reporters with legitimate questions and concerns about his motives for how he operates. This is valid questioning of what and how he makes his decisions. He is intensely hostile towards critical questioning. Now lets look at obama and his relationship with the press. It wasn\'t perfect. When he made mistakes he took the beating. Look at the ACA rollout with the website. He went on Stewart\'s show and Stewart skewered him on live television, but he took it like a champ and admitted that mistakes were made and that they were trying to fix them. Trump would never do that. He would NEVER say he made a mistake, he even said "if I\'m wrong, I\'ll make an excuse" when asked about his statement that NK was not longer a threat. Its one thing to say that as a joke to a staff member or to a reporter that he has a friendly relationship with, but to say that as an official response to a serious question is not acceptable.\n\nNow, lets look at our ally\'s relationship with their leaders: All of them have similar relationships as traditional presidents have had. They support the press\' right to support or decry them. Look at Trump\'s relationship with them, he thinks they\'re weak he thinks they\'re leeches, he dislikes them and thinks he can bully them. Now look at his relationship with the dictator of NK and the defacto Tzar of russia (putin). He admires them. He speaks highly of them. This is where this picture in the OP becomes a problem. Trump decrys free press, he loathes opposition and he he actively adores two men with histories of brutal oppression of dissent. This isn\'t anything hidden or secret, its out in the open. He openly admits admiration for them and how [he wishes the US were more like their countries](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-north-korea-kim-jong-un-people-2018-6?r=UK&IR=T). It doesn\'t matter that he claims he was telling a joke, it matters that he said it.\n\nThe biggest idea that I can impart is that the words of a sitting US president MATTER. This isn\'t our crazy aunt posting links to conspiracy websites that we only see at thanksgiving and politely nod at while looking for a way to get the hell away from her. This is a person who has the power to use the military, to alter the relationships with foreign powers, to set the national tone and he\'s squandered it. Our closest friends have started to move away from us because of his *words*. Just words. This is a *very* bad thing and we need to rectify this quickly or the US will permanently loose its capacity to affect positive change in the world.\n\nYes, it\'s nice that he\'s trying to make friends with NK, but its coming at the cost of *everything* else.'
"As I said, I can see the hypocracy... I may be rather alone in thinking that it's better to give up some symbolics to get talks going, because isolating NK simply doesn't work...\n\nBy fucking it up severely I'm mostly thinking about how that guy doesn't realize how fragile diplomacy can be. He is already causing a lot of instability in the middle east by moving the embassy in Israel at the same time as withdrawing from the Iran nuke deal. Also how he's waging tradewars with long time allies as well as China.\n\nA true stable genius... So, I just hope that his interactions with NK doesn't in fact make the situation worse."

This statement of intent is intended to function as a form of assurance contract.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

'The only reason I’m glad Hillary lost is the republicans would have spent all their time trying to delegitimising and impeaching her.  The house would have more than enough votes to impeach.  The republicans would not have allowed her to pass any legislation.  They might even have tried to deny her filling the Supreme Court seat they stole from President Obama.  \n\nHow are government works is broken.  I don’t see anything getting better.  Not unless our citizens become better educated on the issues of the day.  And the percentage of people voting rises above the mid 50%.  Both parties, but especially the republicans, pander to their extreme wing who more motivated to vote.  Statesman ship is dying in Congress.  Money rules. Like Mike Mulvaney, who is now destroying the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said, when he was in Congress he would only meet with lobbyists who donated to his campaign.  And as an afterthought said, he meet with voters too. Nice of him to sometimes meet with voters.'

'JJ Watt was far more deserving of this award. '
'Yes because GQ is perfectly representative of the national consciousness\n'
'Every week there is another headline about Trumps losing popularity, to which the best response is to just go check the [actual numbers](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/).  His approval ratings have remained the same since about mid-May.  It has been going up as much as it has been going down since May and all we see are headlines about it going down.  This one is more BS than usual, as this is an absurd and meaningless way to try to gauge "national consciousness".'

'This is not a tipping point. Trump is still popular with GOP voters. The true tipping point is when his GOP support drops below 50%'
"41% want him impeached and they say he has a 39% approval rating. \n\nAtm his most recent approval is 45% \n\nhttps://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx\n\nOther news sources say that it's actually 42% that want him impeached not 41%\n\nhttps://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/2018/6/22/17492450/poll-trump-impeachment-nixon-watergate\n\nSo I'm confused what the real polling is or if the polling is bias."
'Pretty sure it always has been. Google searches on impeachment spiked the day he took office.'
'All we are asking, is give Pence a chance.  I really hope not. '
'I would argue even lower. His ardent supporters are more active than the average GOP. They can primary incumbents readily. '
"Good luck with your moral thoughts. Trump isn't going anywhere. There is way too much money to be made for his team."
'Yeah, but what does this mean in the context of the political party seeming to fracture? \n\nIt seems like 80% of 80% of who supported you last year (or before the primaries) can be an easily manipulated statistic, depending on your stance in the argument. Either it’s “80% among Republicans” or “64% among last election cycles republicans”. \n\nSeems very close to the tea party movement days. '
"Now that would be the day. All the Republicans who dislike him join the Democrats or start a new political party. It's a shame that wouldn't happen to be honest. The ensuing shitstorm would be rather hilarious to watch as the far-right voters realise they've just made a big jump to the left possible by electing Trump."
'Looks like Republican party affiliation has been dropping since Trump won. '
'Actually, its much less than you realize. A lot of seemingly solid Red States have a large amount of independent voters. \n\nFor the first time, Arizona, the home of "Goldwater" republicanism has been usurped by Independent voter who hold about 34% of the registered voters with Republicans at 32% and Democrats at 31% with "others" the remaining 3%. This was related several months ago and the Independents percentage is probably higher now. It was the conservative independents who voted for the McCains, Flakes and other Republicans now in office. \n\nIt is these same independents in many key states, not GOP or Dems who will actually make the decisions on who gets elected. Arizona voters were happy and liked both McCain and Flake, but there (were) are loud and persistent right wingers in the Phoenix Valley that supported Sheriff Joe, but even the republicans and Indpendents turned and voted him out of office. A few years ago, there were more Dems in the House from AZ, than republicans, but an onslaught of grey money flipped the seats. Reports/polls show they may flip back. But one thing is certain;\n\nThey are not happy with Trump.'
"Actually, the Dems held both houses in Congress, but they held something much more important. Because Spiro Agnew had resigned the VP slot, if Nixon would have been impeached and the VP slot not filled, a DEMOCRAT, the House Speaker Carl Albert, would have been appointed President (3rd in line)\n The Dems, controlling the Senate, would not confirm Nixon's or the GOP's pick of Nelson Rockefeller for VP. It was not until Nixon and the GOP gave in and suggested  Gerald Ford as a pick, would the Dems approve and a bargain was made. Within weeks of Gerald Ford being sworn in as VP, Nixon kept his part of the bargain and resigned. When it seemed that the Independent Persecutor would indict Nixon, after he left office. Gerald Ford Pardoned him.\n\nNote: the Pardon by Ford was hugely unpopular and it was a bipartisan feeling, as Ford lost the next election 20 months later to Jimmy Carter."

"“Nunes' attendance at the event is newly relevant amid revelations that the special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating a meeting that another congressman, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, took with Flynn in September 2016.”\n\nYes, please look at Rohrabacher. Even his own GOP colleagues joke openly that he’s in bed with the Russians.\n\nETA This from the [LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-russia-rohrabacher-subcommittee-20171026-story.html):\n\n“The congressional subcommittee led by California Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher is being heavily monitored by GOP leaders because of allegations that the Orange County congressman has been overly influenced by his connections to Russia.”"
"Nunes is 100% going to squeal. It really seems like he's not in this too deep and is motivated by protecting himself. "
"I had a dream last night that I had to set up the Interrogation Room (computers, desks, cameras, recorders) for Robert Mueller in center court at The University of Kansas' Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence Kansas. It was just he and I, and he was a pretty nice dude."
'Okay everyone. I want to have a brief bit of fun. Let\'s play the imagine game for one minute. \n\nImagine that morning. It\'s a Thursday. You wake up and your friend texts you, "Turn on the news."\n\nYou turn on the TV and skip past Fox "News" to a more reputable source and on the screen is Bobby "The Mole" Meuller, walking to a podium with a file. \n\nHe sits down and says "After concluding our investigation into the meddling of Russia in the 2016 election, and whether or not the Trump team colluded with the Russians, we HAVE found significant evidence and can confidently announce that we will be charging many members of the Trump team with a melody of charges including money laundering and obstruction of Justice. And I will confirm, President Donald Trump has been charged with money laundering AND obstruction of Justice. I will repeat that, Donald Trump is hereby charged with Obstruction of Justice and money laundering. That will be all. There will be no questions. Are there any questions?"\n\nCue the slow, maniacle Grinch grin appearing across all of our faces. \n\nAnd yes, I shamelessly gave a shoutour to the office. God I love that show. '
'I assumed he just really really loves Trump. That he probably promised him his loyalty due to his ineffective use of blue curtains '
"Playing devil's (literally) advocate here, but how do we know this is true? Snopes still has it as unproven that Nunes was present at this meeting."
'Trump is going to offer himself as a fat fucking stepladder, so Mueller can clean the top of the Grand Ole Pantry. '
'You know...I kind of hope in his final days before Mueller knocks on his door, he is given a choice: own up to it - all of it. And in doing so, protect your family from serious charges (Kushner not withstanding, he\'s on his own). And Donald, being the soft flaccid lump that he is, won\'t even hesitate to try and sell them out to save himself. Because he\'s never had to make a hard choice in his life, and wouldn\'t know how even if he wanted to. The idea of making a personal sacrifice to anyone, even family, is likely an alien concept to a man who is accustomed to taking whatever he wants.\n\nI really want all the MAGA\'s out there for be forced to witness as their "hero" betrays all oaths, even to his own blood, in a cowardly bid to stop the inevitable. I want them to have no place to hide from the truth of how poorly this man measures up. And I want him to sob like a bitch when he suddenly realizes there\'s no way out, and I want him to squeal like a pig when they find out who all else was involved in his treachery.\n\nThat\'s a lot of hopes & wants, but hey - a fella can dream of better days when things are looking grim.'
'First of all, just for the record, no one from California calls it Cali. Please understand California is a huge state with lots of political diversity despite its liberal reputation. Most of Fresno’s population votes in the 16th district and is suburban democrat and ethnically diverse. Nunes’ district, the 22nd, is Clovis, Tulare and Visalia, California. It’s a WASP nest, and republican/Trump land. While Visalia is a small city, its economy is rural agricultural based. Old white farm money built upon the backs of Mexican migrant labor. Basically the modern equivalent of southern plantation owners in the 1800’s. This is how/why Nunes was elected in the first place. If you want Nunes gone, this local mentality is the mountain that must be climbed. That’s why it is of the utmost importance for everyone in this district who values transparent democracy at the federal level, to register and vote him out in 2018. '
'Is there a way to know when Rohrabacher is definitely at his Orange County office and plan a protest with Russian flags and signs focused on this for more media attention?\n\nEdit: same with Nunes at his office?   Do they schedule office hours when they are definitely there? '
'Robert Mueller was so genial in your dream because he is so superior to all Trump supporters.'
'I wish I remembered my dreams more'
"i would love to see this. However sitting presidents aren't charged with crimes. He'll have to be impeached first and then charged. He'll just be pardoned like Nixon. I don't think this ends with Trump in prison. I hope I'm wrong and I hope they do charge him impeachment or not but I just don't see it. Unless we all show up in November. "

'I thought prosecutors controlled timing for best possible chance of a guilty verdict. Pulling the trigger right before the midterms could achieve that end. But you are probably right in this. We will see!'
'I think it\'s a function of the power players catching up to the 24-hour news cycle, especially with the ubiquity of social media. Back in the olden days of 10-15 years ago, before our news cycle became what it is today, people would effectively bury the stories they did not like by arranging for them to be released late on a Friday. This was because, in old-school media consumption, people would primarily read the newspaper/listen to the radio/watch news TV in the mornings and possibly weekday evenings, and not consume nearly as much media from Friday PM through Sunday, and by the time everyone was paying attention again the story would have lost some bite.\n\nA trend in the opposite direction has now developed (and became abundantly clear in the 2016 election): people now release damaging stories about their "opposition" (for lack of a better word) on Fridays. The amount of reporting goes down over the weekend because the media is less active on weekends and is mostly restricted to analysis. As a result, the Friday stories dominate the news cycle all weekend, by way of both editorials/news-analysis shows and social media sharing.\n\nP.S. This is my personal theory on it, but I\'m pretty sure it\'s right. I should also say that it\'s hardly my own theory; just something that I\'ve seen discussed in various aspects that resonated with me.'

It is the art of identifying the plausible, and then portraying it as the logical. In short, people accuse you of “thinking like a lawyer” when you find a way to depict a given set of facts and law, in an accurate but deliberately emphasized fashion, so that the data compels a conclusion that has been pre-established by the lawyer."\n'

That's. Freakin'. Hilarious.  All I needed to do was google this issue and it unleashed a whole world of underground comedy and conspiracy websites with the most amazing of stories. Many put Alex Jones to shame. I made some bookmarks for future lolz.  Thanks for the comedy. :D\n\nI think people care if Trump had an affair in the same year his current wife was giving birth to his child, because it speaks to his character, as if we needed any further examples at this point. There's also the matter of lying about it, and how funds were expended to keep the matter quiet, with possible penalties ranging in an attorney losing his bar license, to breaking of campaign law, and possible imprisonment for parties involved.  Of course none of that will come to pass, but still... its a good reminder of what the person is like who won the Christian vote in the election. What a modern moral example for us all. XD"

"At least he makes himself not look like the obvious suspect. He says arrest who's guilty and find who's innocent. Trump and his followers decide to shift the blame onto some other politician (not on his administration or in support of him), such as Hillary. And acts like a six year old when they've been caught taking a cookie from a jar who's trying to say he didn't do it even though there are crumbs all over him. But of course the similarity are applauding. Trump says happy first anniversary to the greatest witchhunt of all time, Nixon says one year is enough."
"Nixon did some good things.  The EPA for example.  Some folks point to opening China.  But idk about that one given China's recent activities... Maybe it was better they stay closed?  He also was very Pro-Planned Parenthood.  But ofcourse it was because he had hoped that orginazation would keep black folks from having more kids..."

'Seriously. Nixon has the largest popular vote margin in US history and carried 49 of the 50 states in the electoral college. The dude was just super paranoid.'
'Oh yea for sure. If Muellers investigating you you’re gonna get got! Trump is gonna get screwed for his crimes. I’m just super excited to find out what the crimes he committed are and the mountains of evidence Muellers Gonna drop on him. He’s the M bomb!'
"In the short term, that may have been true, just like not going after the Bush administration was less painful in the short term. Yet here we are with a president convinced he can get away with anything. It's worth short term harm IMO to remind everyone seeking the presidency, that you are the highest public servant in the land, and that Commander in Chief just means directing the military for the benefit of the citizens.\n\n\nEdit: seeking not selling, though..."
'Even at the start, Nixon was not exactly loved, especially by the media, and his ethical standards were not considered particularly high. However, he didn\'t seem to be out for personal enrichment-- it was power he was after.\n\nUnlike Trump, though, he thought deeply about policy and had some political skills to accomplish his goals in the face of a Democratic Congress. Domestically, he championed fairly liberal policies while at the same time sending out dog-whistles to "law and order" types and to those opposed to forced busing. In foreign policy, the area he liked the best, he took a hawkish stance in order to make grand bargains.\n\nHe was like those who would later be called neo-cons. He was a brilliant man of substance with a paranoid and unpleasant style. His personality defects would eventually cause his downfall.'
'I mean, there was definetly clear evidence of Nixon being Crook-y, the main difference is Nixon was a career politician and I personally I would argue he was one of the most qualified men to ever run for president. Californian governor, Vice President who ran the country when Eisenhower had a stroke, Nixon was a smart man. Both trump and Nixon are crookish, difference is one of them was competent '
'This is why I love Stephen King '
"It's like the difference between Hillary and Nixon sans their parties. "

"Deputy AG Rosenstein wouldn't allow Mueller's investigation to continue if there wasn't anything further the investigation could yield. The fact that those on the inside expect the case to last *at least* another year is presumably because there is a lot of evidence to go through. From my reading, the investigation is legally bound to follow through on all other criminal leads it falls upon. I'm no expert, but I suspect these types of cases at this high of a level tend to yield many other channels of wrongdoing that take time to investigate.\n\nTL;DR -- If anything, hearing that the investigation will take *at least* another year is good news for those hopeful that justice will prevail.

He has repeatedly lied about associations and business deals on his disclosure forms, needing DOZENS of amendments and re-submissions. Should he be locked up?\n\n3) You can replace Kushner's name above with several other advisors close to the president, and smaller versions of the same erupt.

"* It is probable that when Mueller's investigation completes, even if he finds evidence that Trump is personally guilty of a crime, he will not pursue criminal charges but will refer his findings to congress.\n* Republicans will not act while he has the support of their base.\n* If he was going to lose the support of their base, it would have happened by now.\n* Even if democrats win big in the mid-terms and impeach him in the house, they will not control two thirds of senate so will not be able to convict him.\n\n\nHe will stay in power until the end of this term.

I do believe that Mueller has had information of Donald Sr's knowledge of Russian involvement including the Trump tower meeting long ago. Lets not forget that in that meeting in the Trump Tower between the Trump people and the Russians were a translator who does work for the US State Department and know every word that was said, but more importantly people who have left the Trump administration an are not covered by Executive privilege have been questioned by Mueller, including Hope Hicks. While Mueller knows that Manafort may hold several keys to the Trump campaigns involvement with Russia, what he knows is also shared with other people that Mueller has interviewed long ago.\n\nRight now Mueller is seeking to just corroborate information he already knows. The fact that Mueller of DOJ atty's have not even questioned Cohen and that Cohen has volunteered this information, is informative, it may well be that Mueller does not need Cohens testimony and a linchpin for his case. Cohen though, may hold the keys for several other misdeeds of the Trump campaign outside of Russia, that may be of interest to the DOJ. He can serve to corroborate what Mueller knows though.\n\nNeedless to say, your outline of Trumps legal problems, is just starting to resonate among legal pundits, now its just the witnesses and probative evidence the Mueller already has, to start another indictment process."
'Is Trump being accused of breaking 52 USC 30121, for receiving information from the Russians, in which the information would constitute something of value, defined as:\n\n> It shall be unlawful for a person to solicit, accept, or receive a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value, or to make an express or implied promise to make a contribution or donation, in connection with a Federal, State, or local election\n\n?'

'Ronny Jackson likely also falsified some evidence. Trump’s BMI being just under overweight and his calcium score being indicative of cardiac disease yet totally disregarded in the original report lends me to believe he was covering for the president. \n\nIn light of recent knowledge of Dr. Jackson had multiple allegations of inappropriate requests of his PA’s to order opioids, this addiction may have been leveraged against him to risk potentially losing his medical license and people’s trust in him in order to comply with the demands of the current president.\n\nRonny resigned without resistance. This is likely because these allegations are true with Trump tweeting they aren’t in order to sway the opinion of his major supporters. \n\nIn a few months or so an investigation will be done revealing this. Just one more issue to add to the mess... Hopefully a trustworthy physician can do a mini-mental examination or other marker of cognitive function because Ronny Jackson’s evaluation was likely compromised by the above.'

'And everyone has known this for many months now. The Trump campaign colluding with the Russian government is not a topic of debate, it is fact. That they MAY have received nothing at the meeting is also immaterial. The intent was there. But the Republicans have already proven that facts and evidence mean nothing. Total fealty and undying loyalty to their Lord and Savior Trump is all they care about. There will not be justice without voting all of them out, all of them, or a violent revolution.\n\nEdit: redhats love to play word games with the word “collusion”. Forget collusion. As someone mentioned below, they attempted to conspire against the United States. They met with representatives of the Russian government in order to gain compromising materials, or so they thought, against an electoral opponent. That’s illegal. You can’t do that. That is not the same thing as receiving intelligence from a UK intelligence asset who is an expert on Russia. Don’t let those idiots twist it. They are not the same thing.'

Remember, Trump is legally liable for crimes he committed while not President, even those whose statutes of limitations have run out, if these crimes were purposely and deliberately hidden.Cohen was also a leg man for Trump, meeting people outside the campaign purview, but begs the question is "What did he do?" There is anecdotal evidence he may have been a connection to Russian intelligence or the Russian hackers, if not, then other people that even the Trump campaign felt were too toxic for anyone "in" the campaign to meet with.\n\nI think Cohen feels he has information that is important enough to keep him out of jail, (for his family, of course )and has seen Mueller\'s handling of an unrepentant and uncooperative Manafort.'

Hence he\'s constantly sniping at our friends.   \n\nHe treats our enemies well because getting "deals" with them shows how he\'s winning again.

This does not include incompetence, so by a strict reading you cannot impeach a president for incompetence.\n\nHowever, there\'s no check on the House\'s power to define what a "high crime and misdemeanor is", so for practical purposes they can define it however they like and there\'s no real recourse.  \n\nFor instance, they could choose to impeach a president for getting an ugly pet dog.  That\'s not a high crime.  But there\'s no higher authority to appeal to, so there\'s nothing preventing the House from doing it anyway.  \n\nStepping away from the Trump investigation context, this is actually a pretty major constitutional flaw.  In the event of a conflict between the president and the houses of congress, there is *nothing* present in the constitution that would prevent Congress from impeaching for totally specious reasons.   \n\nIf Congress chose to routinely abuse it\'s impeachment powers, 2/3rds of both houses would be enough to permanently neuter the presidency.  Norms and conventions are all that prevent this from happening.\n\nI know this is a shitposting sub, but I find this pretty interesting if anyone actually cares.  While I hope Trump is impeached if the big M finds evidence of actual "high crimes", I\'m worried about the precedent another highly politicized impeachment would set if the Dems proceed without that evidence.'

He has either opted not to lead as previous Presidents, or Disrupted long standing alliances and trade agreements in ways that have created a vacuum throughout the Western World .  \n\n\nMay, Macron and Merkel are trying to fill that vacuum, but they are in a fierce battle with Xi Jinping and Putin and growing nationalistic populism movements that are looking to destroy faith in institutions and democracy.\n\n\nI wish May, Macron and Merkel success, but when you look at Putin\'s impact on Brexit, Italy\'s new far right fascist regime and parts of the East Asian world that are all adopting less democratic policies while parroting the same Kremlin active measures to destroy trust in institutions, you can see that Trump has served well as Putin\'s useful idiot to destroy democratic values throughout Western Civilization.'
"My bet: They brought up strong evidence of party members outside the campaign involved in knowing what happened, alluding to potential obstruction. I.e. You stay silent when you don't want to go to jail."
"I can't even remember how many times I've written this now, but it's a lot.  Once the evidence is presented, if it's compelling, Congress will can him.  Same exact thing happened with Nixon.  His party had his back right up until the instant they realized the evidence was there.  He resigned almost immediately after he realized he no longer had their support.  Trump will get there, if Mueller brings the evidence."

"They were happening but especially in western Europe (I'm thinking specifically of Germany and Italy), Trump's victory gave them a massive boost. They weren't nearly as immediate of a threat before that. Once they saw the likes of Trump win in the United States, them and their followers started to really believe they could to that again. I really energized them. And lets be honest, seeing a candidate like that win in the Philippines or in Hungary doesn't make nearly as much of an impact as seeing it go down in the US. \n\nAnd before i get railed for being US-centric, I'm Italian.

'Best part is this is still probably the tip of the iceberg. '
'Have a little faith in justice. I have those worries too but then I remember what I felt like this time last year. I really had no hope back then. But things are happening now. We have all these indictments and a handful of guilty pleas already. \n\nI think the reason Manafort hasn’t flipped yet has more to do with his personality. He was still talking to the Russians while he was under house arrest. That takes a lot of balls. Honestly there’s no telling what he’s planning. I think he will flip eventually, just like all the rest. If he doesn’t flip, that doesn’t mean the rest of them will get away with their crimes. \n\nSo here’s to being cautiously optimistic. '
'He’ll be impeached in 2019. I’ve been saying this since last summer and I still believe it to be true. \n\nNow whether or not he’ll see charges and/or jail time I don’t know. But I think this is a time to set an example. Precedent needs to be set. If he has committed crimes then I hope authorities make an example of him. After all, I’d bet Trump can really make that bright orange jump suite work. '
'Correct. Yes I did but I\'ve also been following this investigation from the beginning so I\'m aware the nature of the crimes they\'re being charged with. Why exactly do you think Mueller is charging them with what most consider "low hanging fruit"? Why do you think Mueller is offering and accepting plea deals? These people know the details of Trump-Russia collusion and apparently after offering a few "Queen for a Day" and listening to what they know he feels their testimony would be useful to the overall investigation.'
'The fact that the evidence Mueller and his team has not yet been made public doesn’t mean evidence doesn’t exist or otherwise isn’t there. These financial crimes are “low hanging fruit” for the special counsel. This is a means (and so far an effective one) to encourage the target to cooperate with this investigation. So far the only one who’s been targeted with an indictment that hasn’t plead guilty and offered their cooperation is Manafort. We’ll see how much pressure he can withstand before he too falls in line. '
'I finally got some clarity on what could make people do this:\n\nYour average Trump supporter is not (yet) harmed by Trump or his policies, but they benefit from the community aspect of supporting him. It literally is cult-like. Each of their individual votes do not matter at all -  even if they actually cared about policy, they couldn\'t change it. So what is the incentive to disavow Trump? In their eyes, there is none. They benefit from the political community. They can display loyalty together, they can feel persecuted together, and they can feel united together.\n\nThis is their identity now. What incentive is there to dissent if it doesn\'t accomplish anything politically, and you lose your community? There needs to be incentive to "do the right thing."'

"I will be a really happy man if they can get roger stone.   He's a grade A slimeball"
"That may very well be, however, this subreddit isn't conducting the investigation. professionals are conducting the investigation, professionals who have served our country through thick and thin for the better part of 2 to 3 decades. These are people who don't wake up every day hoping to find crimes, but they do wake up every day to investigate crimes, because that is their job. These men and women aren't looking to topple America, nor are they looking to appease the political masses, if they wanted to do either they could have thrown a bunch of phony charges at trump and brought him to court already. they could have easily slapped him with something back during the campaign when the investigation started, and back when none of us knew it existed.\n\nBut they aren't doing that, they aren't erronously throwing charge after charge at trump. In fact, the Mueller investigation started, and all of its investigations have been specifically targeted towards potential crimes committed by Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort. \n\nThese two are tied to trump because they worked on his campaign, but there exists the very real possibility they were just rogue actors. Either way, we're all better off if these two are investigated thoroughly and put behind bars, *if* that happens to involve trump, so be it."
'Schiff is the anti-Trump.  He’s a brilliant guy (Stanford undergrad, Harvard Law), who has chosen to work in public service as a federal prosecutor.  He is in his 6th term in the House, so he understands the nuances of how the government works.  Anyone who has seen Schiff in interviews knows that he’s a cautious person who is even-tempered, and he chooses his words carefully because he understands the impact of his voice.  He is articulate and humble, and he leads not with bluster or threats, but rather with the power of his ideas.  \n\nIf he ever decides to run for President, I will gladly do whatever I can in my state to get him elected.

"I respect why you feel the way you do, but the whole idea of being conservative is itself bonkers. We need to be constantly updating, improving, changing, getting better - the world is change, we are change, God is change. The very notion of conservative is flawed, and we are witnessing what backwardsness the fear and stagnancy of conservatism can breed. Jesus and America were o.g. liberal progressives. No more time for what doesn't work."

'Nope. We love that obama got bin Laden without starting a war with Pakistan. \n\nRemember when Fox News was bitching about how Obama would pronounce Pakistan correctly? That’s probably why Republicans started a war with every country that wasn’t harboring bin Laden. '
"The good idea behind conservatism isn't to not change. It's to have gradual change rather than abrupt one. Very quick change without discussion will make some people scared at best and make your plans backfired at worst, like for example if you raise taxes immediately to get more money from the ultra rich without real planning, they may run away to another state or country instead. To make the best way to raise taxes for these rich is to hear from them or at least the saner riches, make some compromises, and make plans in case your plan will have some negative initial consequences regardless of their agreement.\n\nYou need many sides to make healthy counter arguments for your policies and discuss some middle roads, or else you'll scare the other side and make stuff cannot be negotiated. Hell, even if your idea's unarguably the good one, having someone from other side will help you to point out the flaws behind your idea (which's why there are pesky editors for creative works in the first place). The problem with Republican is that the huge chunk of them cannot be reasoned with  because all they care about is winning. Even people like me who think democrats being center-right is a bad generalization agreed that republicans are downright batshit insane."

The smart move is to listen to both and find the best middle ground.\n\nThat part about listening is the real key to it.'

'Obama didn’t invade Libya. The EU did and the US played a supporting part. That’s why we aren’t stuck in Libya right now. So, yes I give Obama a lot of credit for getting that right. '

'See my reply to the other poster:\n\nThe indictment against Manafort was Indictment B.  That means there exists an indictment A in the same Grand Jury case.  Indictment A must be a bigger fish than B, and there’s a very short list of who could be bigger than Manafort... Kushner, Don Jr., or Trump himself. \n\nLaw theorists have speculated it is most likely Trump, and that’s why it hasn’t been revealed who it is yet. Mueller knows it *may* be challenged whether a sitting president *can* be indicted. \n\nBasically, either the indictment can be issued (in which case Trump must face court) or Mueller will hand it (the indictment) over to Congress at the end of the investigation to recommend impeachment.\n\nIf Mueller chooses the first option, expect this to be challenged in the courts and to IMMEDIATELY escalate to a Supreme Court case (CAN a sitting president be indicted?).\n\nFun times.  Fun fun times.'
'https://www.justice.gov/file/1007271/download\n\nCheck out the cover page on the indictment.  There is a stamp that says Case: 1:17-cr-00201 — that’s the case number (aka docket number), followed by the judge’s name, followed by the date, followed by “Description: Indictment (B)”.  /u/simchat pointed this out (much to my delight and surprise, thx!). If the Manafort/Gates indictment is Indictment (B) within this case, there is also an Indictment (A), and simchat explained that the defendant in Indictment (A) is a bigger fish than the defendant in Indictment (B).  Simchat understands this better than I do, but it occurs to me that Indictment (A) could maybe be against Trump’s campaign as a legal entity, since I assume it was the principal to Manafort and Gates, who were agents of the campaign (I think?). I’m absolutely spitballing here, of course. \n\nAdditional fun fact, now that I’m down this rabbit hole — the van der Zwaan guilty plea is labelled Information (A) (an information is a different way of pressing charges than an indictment), and is labelled as related to 1:17-cr-00201 (the Manafort/Gates case).  Same judge, too. '

The firm, which has not been accused of wrongdoing by Mueller’s team, has said it is cooperating with investigators.'
'Pretty much anything he did could be pardoned by Trump. The task of PR people is to make that option seem palatable to the American people.'
'I’m sure he’s super-de-duper close to that peace accord. I mean, Trump already gave away a huge piece of leverage when he recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel without getting squat in return. That’s how this works, right?!?!'
'George Mitchell was on Pod Save the World about a month and a half ago or so. He said something like this:  \n  \n“I spent an entire career in public service, as senator and later special envoy to Northern Ireland. I helped broker the Good Friday Agreement and settle a conflict that was nearly a century long, and I took nearly five years to do it. Jared Kushner is 36 and has zero experience in international affairs nor diplomacy. He is apparently more qualified to take on the single most difficult diplomatic problem of our times based on the person he’s married to.”  \n  \nYou know the guy that wrote the Mitchell report on steroids in baseball too? This guy said that about Kushner and how that assignment is an insult to all diplomats working for the US. And further expanding on this, I truly believe Kushner is doing this as a direct favor for Sheldon Adelson, Trump’s other billionaire owner. Pushing the Jerusalem/Israeli settlements issue is a major goal for Adelson. This reeks of his grubby little fingers in the pie. '
'I laughed at that too, but it’s actually a pretty decent defense: dealing with media inquiries can be extremely time consuming, and it’s understandable that a lawyer could be too busy to do it all themselves. That’s why Flynn has what, 7 lawyers? '
"Mueller is prepared for such a thing. There are many, many precautions in place. There are already 30+ sealed indictments (perhaps more, if someone can correct me) that have already been filed with the grand jury. Moves have been made on the state level so that if Mueller is fired, he will just change roles and continue on. Things are WAY TOO far along for this thing to be stopped. Despite the crazies on the Right, Mueller has BROAD bipartisan support at many levels of the goverment. This thing can't be stopped by Trump firing someone. Doens't work that way. I think all this noise you are hearing is the Right trying to force Mueller's hand. They want to know what he is sitting on, or more likely, they know what he is sitting on and they need him to make it public so they can make their next move. Trust and believe in the Special Council. Trump and his fellow congressional turds can't just shut down the investigation, as much as they wish they could. "

"this needs to end with him not just being impeached from office but ousted from the business world completely, he can't just walk out of the white house and back into the boardroom free to capitalize on everything he's set up for himself. he needs to be removed from everything and spend the rest of days in exile wearing ill fitting polyester suits he bought off the clearance rack after a long stint in an orange crotch-binding jumpsuit. all of the trumps. this will mean nothing if they can continue to exploit all the benefits and contacts they've managed to acquire while in office.\n\nas it is now they could get hot-stepped out of the white house like cartoon characters and they will still have won the lottery. finish him."

In a short time, he has done so much damage, not just to our image internationally, but to the integrity of our political and justice systems at home. '
"On one hand, Mueller publishes his findings before the mid-terms. The republicans do nothing, and when the midterms happen everyone sees the party for what it is and it collapses. Alternately they do get off their rich, fat asses and do something and they maintain some veneer of integrity. \n\nOn the other hand, Mueller sits on what he has until after the mid-terms for a guaranteed immediate reaction. However, the backlash the Republican party so richly deserves won't be as severe in this case.\n\nIn either case, it's a win to some degree. Now we just need to sue Fox News into bankruptcy, and sanity will be restored."

Public pressure could in theory convince 'real' (moderate? I dont know the rules anymore) republican reps to not cave and spew neocon rhetoric on trumps behalf to ensure their seats. It could keep general media from being so partisan that every story is a 'breaking news' on the investigation that isn't actually news and just takes air time and discussion time away from other issues. \n\nI personally think the parts I pointed out before don't necessarily lend credibility to the article that could help generate that support or sway the opinions of moderates, who I believe are the real people we need to be catering this news too.

'Too real. I’ve sent articles to my friends who were Trump supporters, or more accurately just voted for him because he was Republican without educating themselves first. They never read them or make an effort to be informed, but when i tell them about things that Trump and his cohort have done they just say things like “i don’t believe that”. Their support for him is completely rooted in stubbornness and pride, and they won’t even try to look at the facts. I wish that they could see that it’s not about politically leaning right or left. It’s about not letting corrupt people get away with bullshit. '
'I wait for them to bring up Trump and when it gets to this point, and it always does, call them a coward. "You\'re not reading it because you know I\'m right and just don\'t want to admit it". be mean when they are pulling dumb shit like this, but nice when they are actual talking and thinking.  \n\nRemember they got conned and have some mix of not realizing it and not wanting to. Beating on Trump isn\'t effective because of the [backfire effect](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/). You need to slowly convince them that Trump has tried to pull a fast one and half the country fell for it but that doesn\'t make them idiots. They wanted a better life and Trump was selling more then anyone could actually offer. Was it transparent? Yeah but lots of people fell for it because he was \'on their team\'.'
'To be fair it is pretty long lmao'
'If he’s really a friend, explain it in clear, non-confrontational terms. “Trump said this, and did this, and these things are racist/bigoted/misogynistic/treasonous. When you support him and say you feel he’s awesome, it makes me worry that you agree with those things. And that’s not something I can stand idly by and be OK with. This isn’t a political disagreement anymore, it’s a disagreement over racism and hatred and treason—that’s not something I can ignore or agree to disagree on.”\n\nStick with verifiables: Trump did this, said that, supported this. Emphasize the difference between political disagreements and hatred: if you just disagree about tax policies or the minimum wage that’s one thing, but this is different and explain why.\n\nKeeping it in those terms has the best chance of getting through to your friend. Even if you don’t change a mind right away, maybe you’ll plant the seed that helps him see things in a new light. Some of the best mind-changing experiences I’ve had are the places where I said, “I don’t agree with that, but this person I like and respect feels differently: maybe I should re-evaluate.”'
'I think you’re on the right track and the right side of history.  I too have cut people from my life over this.  I don’t have any answers, just a hope that justice will prevail.'
'I have to ask for a little clarification. When you say he is a trump supporter do you mean that he is someone who drinks all of the Fox News, pro trump jizz, or is he someone who voted for trump because he didn’t like Hillary? Is he one of those MAGA racists who are too Fucking stupid to understand simple human decency, or is he someone who backed the wrong horse?\n\nI ask because I don’t want to rush to a conclusion about this person. You considered this person your work husband. That tells me that you know this person and you two were close friends. I’ll provide my suggestions for both options because you asked for suggestions, but if you were close with this person, but politics is the only reason why he is dead to you (he’s not racist, or anything it’s just he likes trump and you don’t) I think you shouldn’t let politics come between you. Ok here we go for the two options:\n\nOption 1: If he is in fact the stereotypical Trump supporter who thinks trump can do no wrong, refuses to see another side, down right hates any other opinion, hates immigrants, and brown people (the whole nine yards) I say fuck him. While it’s important to have friends with a wide range of view points if some are unable to humor the idea of someone having a different viewpoint drop them. That kind of toxic people can drain you, and suck the joy out of life. I can’t emphasize enough how even an email response isn’t with your time. He doesn’t deserve it. People like that being shame to this once great nation, and it breaks my heart to know that people like that live here and dare claim to be a patriot.\n\nOption 2: If he is not that stereotypical trump supporter and he is able to hear out different opinions I say talk to him. It’s good to have debates and hear out different viewpoints. It makes you a better person (I think at least), it gives you a tougher skin, and you will learn more about yourself.\n\nI apologize for the long post, but I wanted to offer the every option. The only reason I did this is because you were once close with this person.   \n\nPersonally I did something similar recently with some very old friends. They made a joke about rape, and I fucking ghosted them. I didn’t care, and after I felt amazing! They eventually reached out and asked what was wrong, and we talked. We aren’t close friends anymore, but we still occasionally talk. They are more like acquaintances. Either way you do what is best for you. I hope this helps, and thank you for reading.'
"One of my best friends proudly voted for Trump. Haven't spoken to him since. "
'I would do your best not to antagonise him because that will make him more resistant to change.'
'There’s a lot of hyperbole that gets thrown around when you talk politics. You can probably get through to him if you make it really simple, like: I can’t be friends with someone with bad values. By supporting trump, you’re telling me you’re the type of person who is indifferent to the suffering of Puerto Rican Americans, generalizes wildly about Muslims, and doesn’t mind a leader who calls white supremacists “very good people.” This isn’t normal, and I’m not going to normalize it by acting like I can respect you for supporting it.\n\n\nPs: wtf is a work husband? Like do other people have work soul mates?'
'Sorry for your situation.  If you want to create a framework that will allow you and your father to discuss issues important to you without having an ideological fight, I recommend choosing an issue and you each have to read and send 2 different stories about the topic to each other.  Then the discussion is about what you read.  This avoids lots of traps and completely avoids most of the bs stories that get run on Fox.  I think honest discussions are going to be the only way to repair what was broken.  Agreeing to not talk politics at Thanksgiving is accepting that you’re both too ideologically entrenched to even discuss current events.'
'Damn that sucks. I’ll be thinking of you. When this whole thing collapses post Mueller, which I believe it will, you will need to be there to help catch the parts of melting brain and to try and help put him back together again. It won’t be easy, and people need to be held accountable, but this must be done in an intelligent way. \n\n'

'Actually he had "bone spurs". Several times, in fact. He didn\'t make something of himself, he was born rich. He went to my school, and alums talk about what a fucking moron he was, he was widely disliked. He is pretty clearly a stupid and petty man, I think everyone can agree on that. I wish him luck in "making America great again", hopefully he just does nothing and allows Obama\'s policies to continue fixing the economy.'
'1. Trump is definitely losing money. He is no where near as rich as he was when he began to run for presidency. Idk where you\'re getting this idea. Also you\'re going to need a source for that, but the Chinese investing in, and producing goods in America is a bad thing now? \n\n2. HES RACIST!! Isn\'t an argument. It\'s not a Muslim ban. It\'s a ban on dangerous people we don\'t want in this country. But yeah all the Muslims in North Korea are outraged at this ban, and all the Muslims in India are okay because he didn\'t ban India.... Because it\'s not a Muslim ban. \n\n3. This part is the funny hypocritical part. "He doesn\'t invite CNN to his press conferences boohoo. How will they report on it" and then you say to take away his Twitter?... The easiest and most direct way for him to say things should be taken away? And these news sources will show the entire conference, unlike sources like CNN that will zoom in and try to convince the masses that "stupid DRUMPF poured fish food becuZ he disrespectful! Fish food pouring is an impeachable offense". \n\nAnd man... You sure get this whole "first amendment right" thing mixed up. '
"I really don't have time to answer each one of those (I'm watching peaky blinders, it's really good btw).

'What do the indictments have to do with this? Well, they were brought by the same Special Prosecutor conducting the same investigation.  There’s that.'
'Guys like Bob Mueller don’t make indictments that they don’t have evidence to successfully prosecute on. One of my closest friends was a federal DA New York District. According to him, given the team he’s put together, they are deep into the money laundering pile. '
"I understand that mueller is acting from the perspective of justice and the remit of his special counsel but from a purely partisan political perspective I hope he doesn't act soon. Certainly with the history and breadth of trumps unscrupulous dealings his investigation could last another couple of years. In that time trump is as much of a threat to the republicans as anyone, he is a demonstrably atrocious negotiator and his record breaking inaction in terms of policy is fantastic for the democrats. Mike pence on the other hand  if he were to take office in a matter of months he could do untold damage to a womens right to choose, the separation of church and state, not to mention the usual plutocratic BS. From a personal perspective I hope Trump gets a 15+ year sentence (effectively life)."
'And the mill is grinding out some fine flour of justice from the grist of corruption.'
"he definitely would have the clout to pull a run, but Mueller seems like someone who much prefers being a soldier of the law than a politician that helps decide them. can't imagine him ever taking a job that forces himself to be consciously partisan in any way. "

Honor their work... The patriotic diplomat, the just lawman, honorable civil servants, etc.... Politics need not apply.  \n\n'
"I hope not.  Trump is a prime example of someone who excels at one thing (self-promotion, whether in real estate, reality tv, or politics).  But even if he was very good in business (he isn't), being good at business doesn't mean you'll be good at politics.  This is what I say whenever someone suggests that a non-politician should run for office.  Zuckerberg?  Great businessman.  Complete mystery when it comes to politics.  Oprah? Great interviewer.  Politics?  I dunno.  John Stewart?  Hilarious comedian.  How will he perform on the job as president?  Christ, who really knows.\n\nMueller is an intelligent, focused, and morally upright person.  I am convinced that if he becomes President, he'll try his damnedest to be the best president we ever had.  But...does he have the specific skill set to be president?\n\nWe shouldn't go with celebrity presidents or presidents from outside the public sector, not if they don't prove themselves first with a governorship or senatorship.  Before his horrendous sexual assault allegations, I thought Al Franken was the most likely person to be successful as president who came from the public-sector limelight.  \n\nMueller is a great investigator.  Let's keep him where he's most useful.  "
'But he wouldn’t dare, his integrity is much too great to take advantage of his popularity in order to win a Presidential bid (not that he would want to). '
'He was never going to prosecute Trump.  His job is to gather all the evidence and present it.  Congress and the American people will take it from there.  That should be very clear to everyone by now.'
'You have to trust the justice system. I’m not a trump fan, never have and never will be probably. But I trust the institutions that we have and I trust those that hold those positions. If Mueller says trump did nothing wrong then we have to trust the evidence. '
'I’d vote for him in a heartbeat but I’m almost positive that he’s the dutiful hero that would turn down the presidency.

You can look up the date that Evolution was theorized and compare it to the date genes were discovered, it's all right there for anyone to see.  "

What possible reason could anyone in Russia have to support the NRA? Do they want to promote gun ownership in America? I submit to you that what they wanted was to influence the US election, so they gave money to a US organization that carries heavy influence in US politics. Do you agree that that's probably why Russians would give money to an American gun-rights organization? If you agree, then please tell me, does that bother you? And if you disagree, then please tell me what other reason they would have to give money to the NRA."

"I use castbox. I've used podcast addict before but prefer castbox. \n\nIt's a great podcast that is specifically looking into the Trump organization, not so much the Mueller investigation. They did a great episode about the change in Trumps business practices. Trump was known as the king of debt and proudly proclaimed so. Suddenly for no reason, right around the time Eric Trump tweeted that the Trump Organization was flush with Russian cash they began buying up golf courses and property all across the globe. With cash. Which even if you have the cash you don't do. You only use a little bit of your money and use loans for everything else. But Trump suddenly started buying bad investments with cash. Unless you're cleaning dirty Russian money its really really strange. \n\nThey do a great investigative piece on this in one of their latest episode. "
"That's my read as well.  At a certain point, a well-deployed pardon scheme can basically subvert the rule of law.  Obviously antithetical to our system of government, our founding principles, etc. but norms don't stop bad people from gaming the system.\n\nAt that point, it's on Congress to impeach.  If Congress is complicit, it's on us to replace them.  If we can't do that, we're fucked."

Hacked elections essentially invalidate our entire democracy if we continue to allow it to happen. For those of you who have never made calls before, it is so much easier than you can imagine. You never get to actually talk to a representative anyways, you'll just say what your concerned about and the person on the phone will most likely throw your comment into a spreadsheet indicating what constituents have been calling about so they can see what's been the most important issue lately. Every call I've made has literally been over in no more than 30 seconds unless I really press an issue.\n\nIt may not feel like much by yourself but we need every voice.

And he’s using it as a bargaining chip? \n\nThe much better bargain is impose the sanctions and lift them when they act right.  This is literally saying I know what you did, but I’m going to let it slide.  '
"Are you kidding? Putin, the richest person in the world, sold trump the presidency. Now, Trump is doing his bidding, not enacting sanctions for a low fruit. I'm sorry, the US certainly does influence politics all over the globe. But Putin is out of control and needs to be stopped. Get the fuck out of my country Putin.   \nNow, the Russian people.. amazing people, love them. "
'Yeah I don’t disagree. It should though. I’m hoping we get enough seats that we can have a “reckonin” and if it turns out these guys actually did launder money for Russia or intentionally obstruct justice and I think they did, literally hundreds of them, then they need to be punished with the maximums for whatever they did. But fairly, and honestly and transparently. Not some coup type thing like the current guys are trying to pull off. This is how we restore our countries integrity. By showing the rule of law and the will of the majority wins in the end. If the trump treason stuff is true, he deserves the real penalty for it. But they’ll never go for that. That’s why obstruction is more realistic. '

'Then blame your police chief and other management for not holding bad behavior accountable and mismanaging the organization. Most individual officers want to do their jobs, and this attitude makes it harder for the force to attract good candidates.

'This is such sleazy messaging to scum like Cohen, Kushner, Donny Jr. , little Eric and all the other known, and as yet unknown, liars who carried the can for Trump.  All Trump toadies and criminals will be pardoned he collaterally declares. Everyday there is a new convulsion in the body politic. Democracy has to expel the bile and toxins to be well again. Scooter Libby is emblematic of the bile, and secondarily is consistent with Bolton getting his way to boot. Libby was the kind of neo-con slug that Bolton sees as a loyal soldier to his cause and instincts. Mueller and his team will not lose their nerve and despite the abuse of Executive power Trump and his kind will be humbled and brought to justice. Finding the pee-pee video, isn’t essential, or for that matter important, it’s just the metaphor to put the period at the end of the sentence: Here is the end of the Trump presidency. '
'But is Libby still important enough and connected to the GOP establishment where they would owe him a favor. If Trump wanted support in the firing of Mueller or Rosenstein, I imagine the GOP would exact something far more valuable to them than the pardoning of a disgraced aide no one has really thought about for years. '
'This article made some good suggestions as to why, I believe.\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2018/04/13/politics/trump-scooter-libby-pardon/index.html\n\nPersonally, I think railing against the decisions of a special council in general (and *specifically* one appointed by Comey) makes the most sense, as does the connection between diGenova and Toensing with Libby, who have apparently still been talking with Trump despite declining to represent him.\n\nTake "revenge" on an enemy while doing a favor for a couple supporters? Seems to check out.'
"Great point - hadn't thought of that."
'Its such a terrible way to approach politics. To treat it like a team sport to which you choose a team and owe that team unwavering support regardless of that team constantly doing things that go directly against your self interest. Nobody owes any politicians or political party that type of loyalty. You owe them loyalty only while they are living up to what you feel is bettering your life and country. This blind faith and cult like support is pathetic and has much more to do with a personality cult and a sad need to feel like you "win" something than it does political policy that they agree with.'

'just what i’ve gathered from following this saga, but i looked it up\n\n>[In the United States, the pardon power for federal crimes is granted to the President of the United States under Article II, Section 2 of the United States Constitution which states that the President "shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment". The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted this language to include the power to grant pardons, conditional pardons, commutations of sentence, conditional commutations of sentence, remissions of fines and forfeitures, respites, and amnesties. The pardon can also be used for a presumptive case, such as when President Gerald Ford pardoned Nixon over any possible crimes regarding the Watergate scandal. There is a strong consensus among legal experts that a president cannot pardon someone for state crimes. Experts disagree as to whether a president can pardon himself.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_pardons_in_the_United_States) '
'The Cohen raid is the best public example of this. But, based on the nature of the investigation and jurisdiction of (financial) crimes, it makes sense if only for practical purposes of how things are done. \n\n'

'When the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu visited London in 1978, the British government did some serious sucking up. Ceausescu was an egomaniac and possibly crazy. When he went hunting outside Bucharest, his body-guards shot game with machine guns so he could be photographed at the end of the day with a shoulder-high pile of dead animals. He was also said to be a germophobe, sterilising his hand with pure alcohol if it touched a door handle. The French president telephoned the Queen to warn her that when the Ceausescus came to the Élysée, lamps, vases, ashtrays and bathroom taps went missing from their rooms. But Ceausescu got a state visit to Britain, with a knighthood (later revoked) and a stay in Buckingham Palace.\n\nWestern governments are now trying to appease another germophobe with a reputation for narcissistic excess. The US is not Romania, the stories about Donald J. Trump focus on his cheating at golf, not hunting, and if the great developer removes any bathroom taps, it will be to replace them with something gold-plated. Even so, America’s allies worry that President Trump will get out of bed one morning and do something crazy: abolish Nato, declare war on Canada, give Alaska back to the Russians.\n\nSo how might Britain be sucking up to Trump? A Labour MP, Ben Bradshaw, thinks that the government has not always done all it can to assist the Mueller inquiry into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia. Bradshaw was the minister in charge of the Secret Intelligence Service, known as MI6, and has doggedly pursued allegations about Russian meddling in other people’s elections. ‘I’m told that Mueller’s team were over here late last year and they weren’t happy with the level of cooperation they were getting,’ he said. Another source, with links to the ‘intelligence community’, said this was continuing, even after the Skripal poisoning.\n\nThese claims — of a decision to go slow with Mueller, driven by expediency — have not been confirmed, but if true, the government may have miscalculated. Britain is trying to get a free-trade deal with the US as we leave the EU. And Theresa May was the first world leader through the door of the Oval Office to see the new president. But whatever promises she wrung from Trump will depend on a follow–through and focus he has not shown. This is a president who could not get his own healthcare bill past a Republican Congress.\n\n‘Seen from the inside, the chaos is a hundred times worse than you can imagine,’ said one former senior White House official. There seems even less chance of a special deal for Britain after this month’s disastrous G7 meeting. ‘We’re like the piggy bank that everybody’s robbing,’ the President said. Britain will have to pay a 25 per cent steel tariff just like the rest of the EU and Canada. There was a testy phone call about this with Justin Trudeau, the Canadian Prime Minster. ‘Didn’t you guys burn down the White House?’ Trump is supposed to have said. The President had better not learn this was the British Redcoats or he might begin to suspect a pattern. This is because of the extraordinary number of British connections to what Trump has described as a conspiracy to destroy his presidency: the Russia investigation.\n\nThe most important ‘British connection’ is, of course, Christopher Steele, the former MI6 officer whose ‘dossier’ is the road map for the US inquiry. After he wrote it, Steele asked the retired head of MI6 Sir Richard Dearlove what he should do and was advised that the US authorities had to be told. Dearlove’s partner in a forum for intelligence professionals at Cambridge University was Professor Stefan Halper, apparently a long-standing CIA ‘asset’. Halper was used by the FBI to get close to George Papadopoulos, an aide on the Trump campaign. Papadopoulos was drinking in a Kensington wine bar with the Australian High Commissioner and told him that Russia had supplied ‘dirt’ on Hillary Clinton. Hearing about the conversation, the then director of the FBI, James Comey, began a counter-intelligence investigation with the CIA.\n\nThat is the cover story, anyway: a US intelligence official told me there were ‘many gathering clouds’ in the summer of 2016. Among them might be GCHQ’s intercepts of Trump’s associates talking to Russians. Some — credible — [reports](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/13/british-spies-first-to-spot-trump-team-links-russia) say the head of GCHQ flew to the US to hand-deliver this incendiary material to the CIA director. Later, Steele’s dossier was passed, in its entirety, to Comey, thanks to a former British ambassador to Moscow, Sir Andrew Wood.\n\nThen there’s Cambridge Analytica. The (now shuttered) British company did the Trump campaign’s data. Its speciality was ‘microtargeting’: individual messages tailored to individual voters, delivered by email, Facebook and Twitter. The US intelligence agencies believe that Russian internet ‘troll factories’ were also pushing out pro-Trump propaganda on social media: sometimes fake news, sometimes real news, such as the hacked contents of Clinton’s emails. The question is whether this was done in coordination with the Trump campaign. An American lawyer I know told me that he was approached by a Cambridge Analytica employee after the election. They had had the Clinton campaign emails more than a month before they were published by WikiLeaks: ‘What should I do?’ Take this to Mueller, the lawyer replied.\n\nThere is another (alleged) British connection: the US media reports that former Ukip leader Nigel Farage is a ‘person of interest’ to the Mueller team because he is both friendly with Trump and visited the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange. Farage has vehemently denied he was helping Assange communicate with Trump’s people and has insisted he has ‘no connections to Russia’.\n\nAfter President Trump’s shock election victory, I’m told that Steele briefed his old colleagues in the British intelligence apparatus. His material was taken seriously and then handled at an ‘appropriately senior level’ within the government. But once the dossier was leaked and published in January 2017, he appeared to have been sidelined by the government, his friends say, ‘for political reasons’.\n\nThose who know him say that he still appears bruised by his treatment. Nevertheless, when he subsequently spoke to Mueller’s team, the meeting — in the UK — was set up ‘through official channels’. Mueller has so many British leads to follow, there must have been many requests to the authorities here. Ministers, including the Prime Minster, have been coy about how much help he is getting. Perhaps it is a case of appearing to go slow with Mueller, rather than actually failing to cooperate.\n\nMinisters have also been careful to say that so far there is no evidence of Russian interference in British politics. Steele and others believe evidence of this will emerge. The self-styled ‘bad boy of Brexit’ Arron Banks is being investigated by the Electoral Commission, which wants to know the source of £2.3 million given to Leave.EU, along with at least £6 million in loans to the organisation on ‘non-commercial terms’. This was the biggest single political donation in British history. Banks has a successful insurance business but his opaque finances have led some to ask whether the ultimate source of the Leave.EU money could be Russia. The *Sunday Times* asked him why he’d met the Russian ambassador three times during the referendum campaign. His response was that they were looking for a conspiracy in ‘two boozy lunches and a cup of tea’: ‘Bite me.’ He was similarly dismissive of MPs last week, when they asked if he had ties to the Kremlin.\n\nThe ‘Western intelligence community’ — a nebulous group encompassing Steele, his associates, the US intelligence agencies and many experts in Britain — believe the Kremlin is directing operations to try to shake public faith in democracy across Europe and the US. They think Russia has the same aim as the Soviet Union once did: to break up Nato and the EU, and dominate a continent of weak nations. They view Russia as a criminal state, where the state and the mafia are two faces of the same predatory beast. If that is right, then for the government the choice over whether to back Mueller — and the rule of law — should be no choice at all.'

Mao sought to rectify Chinese historical embarrassments, as did the nazis, and most recently Trumpism.

Bannon has proposed regulating Facebook and Google like utilities and favors economic protectionism over free trade. Establishing a 100 percent free market doesn’t seem to be one of his biggest priorities. Unlike most prominent Republicans, I don’t think Bannon cares much about enriching GOP Donors or multinational corporations. Bannon isn’t pandering to uneducated racists so he can pass tax cuts for the wealthy –I think Bannon genuinely wants to set up an authoritarian white-ethnostate. \n\nIn a lot of ways that makes him the inverse of most congressional Republicans and it’s also what makes him so fucking terrifying.

'Seriously, take a step back and think about this.  While Trump was cruising along in the GOP primaries, his staff was small and dysfunctional.  When it became clear he would win the nomination, he got a little help from the RNC, but not much.  No one, including his own campaign thought he would win.  And judging by the level of competence Trump’s White House has displayed since the election (virtually none whatsoever) I find it incredibly hard to believe that Trump himself could have been involved in any scheme to collude with the Russians vis a vis the elections.  Sure the Russians interfered, but they probably realized that if they wanted the job done right, do it yourselves.  IMO Mueller has the “headshot” for obstruction, and hopefully he has Trump & Co dead to rights on money laundering, as well as a half dozen other crimes.  Not that the GOP will do anything with it, but there it is.  \n&nbsp;  \nTrump is too stupid to collude with Russia interferring with the election.  But Mueller probably has him on obstruction of justice and other crimes.'

"This is pretty much how I see Trump.  Russian intelligence has been all over the guy for 30 years and he's never figured it out."
"I would look at it this way, sowing chaos is pretty much just as useful to putins goals. Russia is not going to be the next world super power, but it can at least try to play kingmaker,  weaken the U. S. standing, hopefully setting up the proper alliances for economic success and global relevance in the future. Trump's incompetence (thank goodness) of playing with political weapons he isn't proficient at, doesn't mean that he wouldn't be dumb enough to try. It also doesn't mean Putin wouldn't seize the opportunity. \n\nIf trump had lost, how many of these guys would be punished? Probably less or none. What kind of connections could Russia have made, especially if people in the know were told what they had accomplished? What future havoc could they wreak with more active support in the u.s. in 2020 or 2024 with a more competent plan and candidate. \n\nI agree that nobody expected trump to win, but i think Putin was playing the longer game and america is just a little too stupid.  It worked out like this instead. Trump is still guilty though. "

Rest assured, more will continue to come out."
"Well, Russia went broke for a while, so trying to outspend us militarily wasn't an option.  They had to get creative and work on a budget.  I think the USA kind of relaxed a bit too much and just assumed that were untouchable.  Russia took advantage of our hubris."

The High-Ranking Campaign Official referred him to the Campaign Supervisor because "[h]e is running point." Defendant PAPADOPOULOS then emailed the Campaign Supervisor, with the subject line "Re: Messages from Russia": "I have the Russian MF A asking me if Mr. Trump is interested in visiting Russia at some point. Wanted to pass this info along to you for you to decide what\'s best to do with it and what message I should send (or to ignore)."\n\n...\n\n>>After several weeks of further communications regarding a potential "off the record" meeting with Russian officials, on or about August 15, 2016, the Campaign Supervisor told defendant PAPADOPOULOS that "I would encourage you" and another foreign policy advisor to the Campaign to "make the trip[], if it is feasible."\n\n>>^2: The government notes that the official forwarded defendant PAPADOPOULOS\'s email to another Campaign official (without including defendant PAPADOPOULOS) and stated: "Let[\']s discuss. We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips. It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal."\n\n\n>Please note that these are not mere allegations. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to the charge of lying to the FBI, and stipulated to the truth of those facts. \n\nThey rarely have a response to this comment.

'Come join us at r/Russialago if politics wont have you... this is a great comment, and many will pick this up and help you.'
'Im geneuinely trying to understand this better so please dont attack me. But I dont understand how this is evidence that Trump colluded. It sounds like they say Trump specifically wasnt involved in this. I mean it depends the context of "send a signal". Seems like how you interpret thats the only evidence, and obv that can be interpretted many ways. Do we know if they even sent someone tho? Or that Trump knew they were. And this was like 3 months before Trump won. I thought the claims were Trump had been colluding with Trump since early on? And if he had why would they even be having this discussion. Seems like proof that Trump at least wasnt colluding until the very end of the election.'
"The reply is easy:  there is no evidence of collusion in that passage.  Nothing whatsoever.  It is not uncommon for presidential nominees to have contact with foreign government leaders, or meet with foreign officials.  Try to act like it is, but is not uncommon.  \n\nIs anyone crying collusion about how Trump met personally with Enrique Nieto or Bibi Netenyahu?  Clinton had meetings with Shinzo Abe and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in October a month before the election.  There is nothing illegal about that.\n\nThe only thing evident in that passage is that for whatever reason, the campaign didn't want Trump doing the meeting in person.  You can read into it whatever you want.  You can say they were discussing new resort locations for Elvis Presley and Jimmy Hoffa to live at.  There is nothing illegal about meeting foreign representatives, and this passage doesn't even prove they did meet with anyone, only they were talking about it."
'> Is there any proof that Trump himself asked the Russians for help \n\nYes. He did it on national television. He also confessed to obstruction of justice on national television.'
'Good call, thanks'
'I\'ll clarify this for you because this point is often missed. You\'re right, speaking with foreign entities isn\'t the issue. The issue is negotiating policy with them prior to actually becoming the president. Mueller\'s angle here is that Trump\'s team was actively negotiating a sanctions reduction or removal with Russia before the election, likely in exchange for business advantages with various members of Trump\'s team and possibly his family. This is collusion because it sparked Russia to actively interfere with the election, and right now there are many signs that this was the case. One of the biggest being the Russians signaling that they were sitting on top of Hillary\'s hacked email archive and that Don Jr was more than happy to receive this "gift". '
"Yeah, a huge waste of money.\n\nWhere as scumbags like Scott Pruitt who are flying constantly on first class and Trump's weekly golf trips are wonderful uses of taxpayer money. "
">Mueller needs something that republicans can't deny or attempt to discredit\n\nSo, testimony by God, in person, with video recordings to corroborate his testimony, all conveniently on a day when FOX temporarily stops broadcasting, and Congress oversleeps.\n\nBut even then, it didn't happen.  And if it did, it wasn't collusion.  And if it was, Donny didn't know.  And if he did, it wasn't that bad.  And if it was, we deserved it."
'Almost every politician opperates in the grey areas of the law, which isnt illegal. That is old news and simply wasnt illegal because the women technically wasnt an offical anyways. This just isnt anything significant enough to be termed as evidence towards actual collusion. The goal posts are moving. Do u agree that this at least evidence that they had not been colluding with Russia up until this point? I mean why would they be going to this meeting if they were already in contact?'
'moving goalposts? Nice analogy. No score though. Looks like Papa D was a bench warmer or towel boy.'

La la la I can\'t hear you, I don\'t care about anything but my own feelings and you\'re being meeeean!"\n\nSo yeah, he\'s pretty darn defeated.'

If we can\'t even trust someone like that to do his job, how can we trust anyone in public office? Remember, the investigation was started to find evidence of Russian tampering in the US election. So far, **five people have plead guilty, and 17 more have been indicted.** As far as official political investigations go, this has been one of the most successful in modern history. Whatever your stance on Trump, if he hasn\'t done anything wrong then he\'s got nothing to worry about.

"Obama extended Mueller's statutory term as head of the FBI for two years from 10 to 12 because it just so happened that there were several other high-profile departures within DHS around the same time (head of the CIA was one), and they didn't want to upend the whole department's supply of institutional knowledge all at once.  He did this with the consent of a Republican Congress.  Two years later, he appointed James Comey to replace him, again, with Republican Senate approval. Throughout his term, Meuller had extremely high levels of bi-partisan respect for his integrity and skill in the job, hence the extension. Then Bengazi, butter emails and Russiagate happened, which politicized the whole department's interaction with the political establishment in Washington. And, because for the Republicans, winning elections is more important than *anything else* they decided to politicize an agency which had been supremely apolitical since the death of J. Edgar Hoover.  Feel free to drop that on your father, because that's what actually happened."
'This needs to be copypasta to any and all MAGA arguments in any existing conversation in our current political environment. \n\nWe as a nation have fought against fascism before, and history revels in the glory of it as a testament to the greatness of of freedom and democracy. \n\nFascists have very few anecdotal historical references to hold up in reverence to their arguments. Consistently remind them that Fascism has never been touted by any of our revered historical figures of our great nation - and that those who did espouse its virtues to the world on the grand stage never died of natural causes.'
'> Why are you trying to rock the boat?\n\nReminds me of MLK’s letter from jail about how the white moderate who “prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice” is more detrimental to the fight for Civil Rights than the white radicals like the KKK.\n\n\n\n>I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro\'s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen\'s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action"; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man\'s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a "more convenient season."'
"Sounds like it's time for some good old no-contact."
'Many, many other presidential campaigns, including Obama\'s, have been approached by foreign nationals offering "help" of one sort or another.

"I see your reasoning but none of it is actually valid.  The Greens are what, the second largest political party in the world being the CP?  They aren't just spoilers, they represent the interests of the biosphere beyond petty human concerns, and the human rights of humans beyond economic concerns, and the advancement of science.  \n\nShe went to Russia because she was hoping for help achieving these goals, however corrupt the motives of the Russians might have been (and they were, the Russians in power are the bastard children of Reagan and Murdoch's neoliberalism).  \n\nThe Greens are in fact far to the left of the Russian or for that matter any remaining communist party in that they hold to an uncompromising and unsympathetic analysis of the history of capitalism.  Read the work of David Cobb if you don't believe me.\n\nAs for where the Greens campaign -- they're a political party and have every right to campaign where they choose. You have to disabuse yourself of the idea the dems are somehow the good guys in all this and that somehow the Greens tacitly see them that way. Even the FDR dems were a bulwark *against* true progressive change, and the neoliberal dems of the Clinton generation are far to the right of anything the Greens could possibly support -- and the Russians are even further right.  The Greens don't play to win in the US except in a few enclaves, rather, they try to win percentages of totals that get them certain advantages in the corrupt profoundly anti-democratic two party system in which they are forced to operate.  \n\nI assure you, Clinton did a fine job of weakening herself. If she hadn't used that private server in the first place, none of this would have happened.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I want to see Trump et al drawn and quartered as much as the next guy, not least because I'm a true progressive -- but it doesn't therefore follow I have to have respect for what the dems have become.  And I'm not an outlier -- a huge percentage of the voting/non-voting public feel as I do -- that our modern views simply aren't represented by either corporate party, and that both in fact are profoundly the enemies of the survival of higher life on the planet."

'Lmao. \n\nMueller was appointed as a Special Counsel by Rod Rosenstein in May 2017 pursuant to Rosenstein’s authority as Acting Attorney General.  In the appointment order, Rosenstein states that Mueller is subject to the regulations governing special counsels.  One of those regulations, 28 CFR §600.7 (a), specifies that the special counsel must “comply with the rules, regulations, procedures, practices and policies of the Department of Justice.”\n\nTherefore, Mueller must comply with the policies of the Justice Department – and the policy of the department according to the opinions issued in 1973 and 2000 is that a sitting president cannot be criminally indicted or prosecuted. \n\nThe bottom line is that no matter what evidence Mueller turns up, he can’t indict the president if he follows DOJ policy unless that policy is changed by the Deputy Attorney General or the Attorney General.   According to the Justice Department, the only way a president can be removed from office is through impeachment, and that process has never once ousted a president.'

'Mueller knows the 13 Russians are never likely to set foot in a U.S. courtroom. Seems the primary goal of indicting them (beyond the pursuit of justice for its own sake) was for the DOJ to make the case beyond a reasonable doubt that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, thereby laying to rest some angst from some in the right that the probe is a waste of time. It was important for them to do so through the proper scope of the court and not through some semi-informal method like an unclassified memo that would be endlessly debated. The fact that a grand jury indicted these Russians means the charge is backed up by substantial proof. '

'This is a dangerous sentiment we shouldn’t make into some universal truth just because we are convinced of it in this particular instance. Investigations are intrusive, burdensome, restrictive, and the suggestion of impropriety can do the work of truth. Innocent people have every right to begrudge an investigation into them. This is some blatant “If you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear” bullshit that, particularly in light of the 4th Amendment, runs pretty contrary to American values. '
'OP is clearly making fun of you all.'
"The best response is to publicly acknowledge the allegations, calmly deny them, and say that the truth of your innocence will come out in the investigation. I don't agree that protesting the investigation is an indicator of guilt like the picture says, but it will certainly seem that way to a lot of the public. "

"Copy and pasted because someone just asked me this question.  Mueller's job is not to indict Trump. He has a long and distinguished past and has served this country for decades. He is just now finally getting the the mainstream recognition he deserves. Republican or Democrat, everyone should be thankful for Mueller, for all the work he has done to protect this country already and the work he does now. He was a Ivy League grad, Marine, publican servant, and a true patriot.

'**Robert Mueller**\n\nRobert "Bob" Swan Mueller III (; born August 7, 1944) is an American lawyer and civil servant who was the sixth Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 2001 to 2013. A Republican, he was appointed by President George W. Bush and his original ten-year term was given a two-year extension by President Barack Obama, making him the longest-serving FBI director since J. Edgar Hoover. He is currently head of the Special Counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.\n\nA graduate of Princeton University, Mueller served as a Marine Corps officer during the Vietnam War, receiving the Bronze Star Medal with Combat "V" for heroism and the Purple Heart Medal.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

I could use a confidence booster. "
"I think what is going to come from this is going to be historical. Based on the Trump team's reaction to the realization that Muellers team has all the transitional team's emails is an indicator they have no idea what Mueller has.  \n\nI also don't think Mueller is going to go after anything that doesn't hold up before the Grand Jury, which is standard and if there is anything on Trump, it goes to Congress.  Congress is the wild card. \n\nThough the fact we may see Kushner and Donald Junior be indicted, will be priceless. They're also the only two parties that Flynn could have negotiated his plea agreement, which also states he could receive additional charges, would have weight to negotiate.  "

"Everything I've read from lawyers on twitter (@tribe etc) say there is precedent that accepting a pardon is an admission of guilt, as such it could be used as such in state cases which are not pardonable by the president.\n\nTrump's pardon of Sherif Joe has resulted in civil liability exposure and a rather abrupt realization that it is now impossible for him to be exonerated through the judicial process.  Joe isn't going to jail but he may die broke.\n\n@tribe and others also argue that a case can be made that a pardon can not be issued where there is a conflict of interest (self pardon or pardoning conspirators).  But testing that is a ways off.\n\nRegardless, pardons are more of a monkey's paw instead of a panacea especially in the hands of someone like trump."

'I used to be a Republican. Then one day, I realized that today\'s Democrats *actually* represent the things the Republicans claimed to. Fiscal responsibility, personal liberty, and thoughtful policy over emotional appeals were once the Hallmark of Republicans. Now, they only care about "cut and spend" politics and pushing Christian values as law. Fuck all that '
'I made the conversion back in 2008 when Obama was running, although I had considered George Bush to be an idiot for long before then. I was really only drank the kool-aid when I was younger (back in the 90s). \n\nBut one day I realized that the things I valued were not represented in the actions of the GOP.\n\n1.fiscal responsibility: the democrats may be "tax and spend", but the GOP is cut and spend. I don\'t like tax and spend, but it is technically feasible> The GOP spends just as much, but they cut taxes and then borrow the money. That is not fiscal conservatism. True responsibility means spending money wisely, including spending more in some places to save money elsewhere. Furthermore, I looked at deficits during presidencies in my life. The debt skyrocketed under Regan and Bush Sr. Clinton took that and handed off a **balanced budget** to Dubya, who promptly drove the economy into the ground. Obama then spent 8 years recovering us from that disaster. So really, who is actually making smart fiscal decisions?\n1.personal liberty: I don\'t want the government telling us how to live our lives, and I apply this equally to everybody. If you are gay, the government shouldn\'t limit your options, including your ability to marry. I\'m sure I do shit people don\'t like, and I don\'t want to change. So that means I can\'t ask you to change if I don\'t like what you do. If you want an abortion, just let them. If you don\'t like it, don\'t get one. The GOP went from the personal liberty party to the christian conservative party who wanted to legislate their religion\n\nAs for how you find and convince people like me, I have no idea. I think the big thing is that I\'m agnostic, so I actively dislike the christian bent of the GOP. I don\'t know how many non-religions republicans are out there (probably not many at this point). The other big thing is to get people out of the environment that reinforces their views. I was feeling cognitive dissonance for a while, but until I moved away from my father, I wasn\'t able to face the fact that my politics directly contradicted my beliefs (even then, it took years). \n\nBut also, I\'m an add duck. The reason I support Bernie Sanders is because if the Democrats go back to being liberal again, the GOP can go back to being respectable conservatives again. And then, the political center will go back to the actual center.'
'Simply amazing how the republican base fawn over this failure.\n\nWent bankrupt so many times, he had to resort to Russian sourced loans.

And they still love him. But yet they think they are true blooded americans. Fucking sellouts.'
'I think you’re thinking of Boris Yeltsin. \n\nNo offense to anyone but I keep seeing that it feels like this or it seems like that. This is going to end up in the dictionary as an example under the words blatant and/or obvious, you ask me. \n\nYes Trump is aiding the Russians. Yes, he is under investigation for possibly receiving aid from the Russians to get elected. This is quid pro quo, but there is nothing to do unless the house and senate grow a pair and impeach him immediately. '
'Perfect divide and conquer technique.  Well done putin '
"How does demanding that NATO spend more money on defense, as they agreed to, by treaty, help Russia?  How does ending bad trade deals for the US benefit Russia?  How does a roaring economy, repatriating money from overseas, and low unemployment here in the US help Russia?  How does reducing regulation and taxes here, and thereby helping the US become not just energy independent, but a net exporter of energy help Russia?  How does America shipping LNG to Europe so they won't have to depend on Russian natural gas not to freeze in the Winter help Russia?  \n\nThe short question is, how does a stronger America and a stronger NATO help Russia?  This is where your narrative falls apart.  \n\nEdit:  How does getting N. Korea to get rid of nukes and make peace with S. Korea help Russia?  "
"I think you're right.  I was reading the other day about the Western political spectrum being reorganized from a left-right model to an [open-closed model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_political_spectrum).  It made *a lot* of sense to me.  I think in 20-30 years this transition will be complete.  What that means for the current left-right parties? Hard to say, especially in the US, but some fracturing might take place, especially on the right.  I could see the Democrats transitioning from center/center-left to open, but it's harder to see the GOP transitioning fully to a closed model.  Many of the large backers of the GOP need globalization in order to maintain their positions.  I think it's more likely that the GOP will split into a closed party and an open party which is more conservative on social issues."

"These summits aren't a 'cool kids club'.  The purpose of the group is economic, to advance the common interests of the largest developed global economies.

That point comes when Russia decides to not invade sovereign states, and instead play nice with other nations to benefit its own economic interests.  Until then, agreed, fuck those guys.\n\nEdit.  To address whether or not the US should or shouldn't be removed as per Macron's proposal.  Honestly guys, it doesn't really matter.  With Trump as the head of state and his nitwits running the show, America's national interests aren’t getting advanced at this thing.

As in, when he believed something he would passionately fight for it -- not because it served some utilitarian purpose, but because he had principles that he stood by. \n\nIn a weird way, the OP sort of proves this. He probably could have indicted people in the Benghazi investigation based on a disdain for Hillary or his other partisan opponents, but he didn't. Because he performed a thorough and detailed investigation and [determined that there was no intentionally wrong-doing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=59&v=5GsXrZSyIj0)\n\nI'm sure he has his personal feelings about the matter, but he doesn't let them get in the way of reality.

The Blue Wave will probably diminish given he has a strong economy and job growth (thanks Obama?), even if that's not necessarily from his own actions.

To your point of him leaving office, I think his excuse would be that he just cant work with the government, inept etc. etc. I am going back to my family job where I can work with people who can work with me.\n\nTrump may be rich and powerful but he screwed lots of people over in his day as NYC loud mouth.  Endless litigation, burning well to do people etc. The guy is an asshole and yea he found a way out of everything HOWEVER he is now under scrutiny the likes of which he has never known.

'Trump is taking the right approach. Unless you actually want to start arresting  Russian intelligence officers or overthrowing Putin, all one could do as a "normal" politician is huff and puff and stomp your feet. \n\nMeddling in elections is a time-honored tradition among superpowers (or former superpowers). The United States holds the record for most elections meddled in at 81. Russia (or the former Soviet Union) is second at 36. In 1964 both the Soviets and the United States meddled in the Chilean election. The CIA spent $2.4 million in secret to make sure the socialist did not win. With no surprise the Christian Democrat won. \n\nI felt that Facebook ads and hacked servers that should have been more secure would be a footnote in history. Instead, it\'s being used against a man who campaigned on and never made secret his desire to normalize relations with Russia to tackle bigger issues. He knows how other presidents have approached Russia and it has gotten us nowhere. He has seen how Europe is being slowly invaded and is buckling under its various welfare states and damn near Orwelian speech laws and won\'t be much stronger in the future. No loss there.\n\nIt really baffles me how anyone could be against Russia and America even just talking. Even if nothing happens, that\'s about as much as we could expect from any other administration when it comes to Russia and North Korea. \n\nI just have no strong feelings on it. I\'m cynical about all of it.  That\'s enough to get you exiled these days. \n\nI think a lot of it is jealousy from the establishment and their sympathisers. They should have been the ones dealing with the Russia problem, and all the other problems in the world, not the worse candidate in history who beat the best candidate in history. '

We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\n\n**July 13, 2018 Special Counsel Mueller\'s indictment of 12 Russian Intelligence Officers.**\n\nLast week the Justice Department indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers linked to Guccifer 2.0 and their role in hacking Clinton and the DNC.^[[2]](https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download) The Russians had access to information on 500,000 voters, officially vote tallies were not changed however they targeted voter registration rolls.^[[3]](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/13/5-key-takeaways-from-mueller-indictment-of-russian-election-hackers.html)\n\n>The Russians allegedly hacked America\'s election infrastructure, including state election boards and secretaries of state. The allegations in Friday\'s indictment went well beyond merely hacking the Clinton campaign and Democratic campaign committees. From one state election board, the Russians managed to steal information on 500,000 voters, Rosenstein said, although he did not identify which state. Trump won the 2016 election by winning three key states by slim margins that added up to around 80,000 votes.\n\n>...An American congressional candidate allegedly asked for, and received, stolen documents about his or her opponent from the Russians. \n\n>...A journalist allegedly discussed with the Russian front account, Guccifer 2.0, about when to release stolen documents related to Black Lives Matter. \n\n>...Russian hackers targeted Clinton emails the same day Trump called for them to find "missing" emails.\n\n**July 27, 2016, remember the date. Candidate Trump publicly asked Russia for their help to hack Hillary Clinton, Russia obliged.**\n\nDuring a campaign rally in Florida on July 27, 2016, President Trump called on Russia to help him find Hillary Clinton\'s missing 30,000 emails.^[[4]](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html) Special Counsel Mueller\'s new indictment against 12 Russian Intelligence Officers found that on July 27, 2016 Russian hackers known as Guccifer 2.0 hacked Hillary Clinton\'s emails.\n\n*DoJ Indictment of 12 Russian Intelligence Officers Pg. 7 - 8*\n\n>The Conspirators spearphished individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign throughout the summer of 2016. For example, on or about July 27, 2016, the Conspirators attempted after hours to spearphish for the first time email accounts at a domain hosted by a thirdparty provider and used by Clinton’s personal office. At or around the same time, they also targeted seventy-six email addresses at the domain for the Clinton Campaign. \n\n**June 9, 2016 - A month before candidate Trump publicly asked for help from a foreign adversary, his surrogates met with Russian operatives at the now infamous Trump Tower meeting.**\n\nOne of the Russian operatives present at the infamous Trump Tower meeting, Rinat Akhmetshin, has ties to Russian intelligence and has a history of being embroiled in  court cases related to hacking campaigns. He also has ties to Paul Manafort.^[[5]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/21/us/rinat-akhmetshin-russia-trump-meeting.html?referer=)\n\n>He has an association with a former deputy head of a Russian spy service, the F.S.B., and a history of working for close allies of President Vladimir V. Putin. Twice, he has worked on legal battles for Russian tycoons whose opponents suffered sophisticated hacking attacks, arousing allegations of computer espionage.\n\n>Few episodes from Mr. Akhmetshin’s past seem more relevant to Mr. Mueller’s investigation than his work for two Russian billionaires accused of infiltrating their adversaries’ computers during nasty legal battles.\n\n>The Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 took place less than a week before revelations that hackers had penetrated the Democratic National Committee’s computers and obtained a trove of emails. Investigators have traced digital espionage to Russian spy agencies. \n\n>During the same period that Mr. Akhmetshin was accused of being involved in various hacking schemes, he appears to have been nurturing a relationship with Viktor Ivanov, once the deputy head of Russia’s intelligence service, the F.S.B., and until last year a top aide to Mr. Putin.\n\n\n>Mr. Akhmetshin told journalists that he was a longtime acquaintance of Paul J. Manafort, who served as a high-paid consultant to Mr. Yanukovych for years before becoming chairman of the Trump campaign.\n\n**August 22, 2017 Senate Intelligence Committee Testimony that the Trump campaign accepted regular intelligence from the Kremlin**\n\nThe Senate Judiciary committee testimony of Fusion GPS CEO Glenn Simpson was released unilaterally by Senator Feinstein because Republicans refused. Simpson confirms that the Trump campaign likely received foreign intelligence aid during the 2016 campaign as Manafort had close ties to Russian Intelligence.^[[6]](https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/3/9/3974a291-ddbe-4525-9ed1-22bab43c05ae/934A3562824CACA7BB4D915E97709D2F.simpson-transcript-redacted.pdf)\n\n*Pg. 154 - 155 Senate Judiciary Committee Testimony*\n\n>A. I mean, one of the key lines here in the second paragraph says "However, he and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his democratic and other political rivals." So the issue with the Trump Tower meeting, as 1 I understand it, is that the Trump people were eager to accept intelligence from a foreign government about their political rivals and that is, you know, I would say, a form of interference. If you\'re getting help from a foreign government and your help is intelligence, then the foreign government\'s interfering. I mean, you know, I think that also -- of course, in retrospect we now know this was pretty right on target in terms on what it says. So anyway --\n\n>Q. In reference to you think that particular sentence?\n\n>A. I mean, it clearly refers to, you know, them being interested in and willing to -- it depicts them as accepting information. What we have seen to date with the disclosures this year is they were at a minimum super interested in getting information.\n\n>Q. And when you\'re referencing the "disclosures this year," could you just be specific about that.\n\n>A. The Trump Tower meeting.\n\n>Q. So with reference to the June 9th Trump Tower meeting?\n\n>A.

This operation was funded through Russian fronts, including a catering company run by a close friend of Putin, Yevgeny Prigozhin. They used stolen American identities. Operatives bought political ads on social media sites. Operatives visited the United States, traveled across 9 states and discussed escape routes if they were caught inside the country. Operatives bought equipment including burner phones and SIM cards. The operation included hundreds of employees and millions of dollars, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein put it best  - the Russians conducted information warfare during the election.^[[2]](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-43092569/russians-conducted-information-warfare-on-us-election) According to the indictment Prigozhin met Mikhail Bystrov, a leader of the Internet Research Agency (IRA), regularly in 2015 and 2016. Prigozhin funded the Internet Research Agency and their meddling of the American election. This was a sophisticated operation that spanned over several years.

The conspiracy had as its object impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful government functions of the United States by dishonest means in order to enable the Defendants to interfere with US political and electoral processes, including the 2016 US presidential election.  \n\n>**Manner and Means of the Conspiracy:**\n\n> 29.. Starting at least in or around 2014, Defendants and their co-conspirators began to track and study groups on US social media sites dedicated to US politics and social issues. In order to gauge the performance of various groups on social media sites, the ORGANIZATION tracked certain metrics like the group\'s size, the frequency of content places by the group, and the level of audience engagement with that content, such as the average number of comments or responses to  a post. \n\n\n\n>a. KRYLOVA and BOGACHEVA, together with other defendants and co-conspirators, planned travel itineraries, purchases equipment (such as cameras, SIM cards, and drop phones), and discussed security measures (including "evacuation scenarios") for Defendants who traveled to the United States. \n\n\n>**Use of US Social Media Platforms**\n\n>32.. Defendants and their co-conspirators, through fraud and deceit, created hundres of social media accounts and used them to develop certain fictitious US personas into "leader[s] of public opinion" in the United States. \n\n>**Use of US Computer Infrastructure**\n\n>39.. To hide their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation, Defendants and their co-conspirators - particularly POLOZOV and the ORGANIZATION\'s IT department - purchases space on computer servers located inside the United States in order to set up virtual private networks ("VPNs"). Defendants and their co-conspirators connected from Russia to the US based infrastructure by way of these VPNs and conducted activity inside the United Sates - including accessing online social media accounts, opening new accounts, and communicated with real US persons - while masking the Russian origin and control of the activity. \n\n>40.. Defendants and their co-conspirators also registered and controlled hundreds of web-based email accounts hosted by US email providers under false names so as to appear to be US persons and groups. From these accounts, Defendants and their co-conspirators registered or linked to online social media accounts in order to monitor them; posed as US persons when requesting assistance from real US persons; contacted media outlets in order to promote activities inside the United States; and conducted other operations, such as those set forth below. \n\n>**Use of Stolen US Identities**\n\n>41.. In or around 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators also uses, possessed, and transferred, without lawful authority, the social security numbers and dates of birth of real US persons without those persons\' knowledge or consent. Using these means of identification, Defendants and their co-conspirators opened accounts at PayPal, a digital payment service provider; created false means of identification, including fake driver\'s licenses; and posted on ORGANIZATION - controlled social media accounts using the identities of these US victims. \n\n>**Actions Targeting the 2016 US Presidential Election**\n\n>42.. By approximately May 2014, Defendants and their co-conspirators discussed efforts to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election. Defendants and their co-conspirators began to monitor US social media accounts and other sources of information about the 2016 US presidential election. \n\n>43.. By 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used their fictitious online personas to interfere with the 2016 US presidential election. They engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump. \n\n>45.. Defendants and their co-conspirators also used false US personas to communicate with unwitting members, volunteers, and supporters of the Trump Campaign involved in local community outreach, as well as grassroots groups that supported then-candidate Trump. These individuals and entities at times distributed the ORGANIZATION\'s materials through their own accounts via retweets, reposts, and similar means. Defendants and their co-conspirators then monitored the propagation of content through such participants. \n\n>46.. In or around the latter half of 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, through their ORGANIZATION-controlled personas, began to encourage US minority groups not to vote in the 2016 US presidential election or to vote for a third-party US presidential candidate. \n\n>47.. Starting in or around the summer of 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators also began to promote allegations of voter fraud by the Democratic Party through their fictitious US personas and groups on social media. Defendants and their co-conspirators purchased advertisements on Facebook to further promote the allegations. \n\n>**Political Advertisements**\n\n>48.. From at least April 2016 through November 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, while concealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation through false personas, began to produce, purchase, and post advertisements on US social media and other online sites expressly advocating for the election of then-candidate Trump or expressly opposing Clinton.

'The Constitution requires the POTUS to uphold the law and the Constitution itself.

"I make a habit of checking Fox News about once a week to see what techniques they are using to dupe their followers and seed prejudgement before the present what little information they actually provide. I was surprised to see this FISA story this morning, and until this thread I was confused about only one thing:\n\n* Why wasn't the information in this memo, whatever it says, discussed at all before the recent Senate and House votes which passed continued (and perhaps expanded) surveillance? Why does this come out less than a week after voting yes on something?\n\nBut after reading this thread (what little information is here, other than evidence that Russian bots are in support of a release the memo hashtag), I now additionally wonder:\n\n* Hypothetically, what kind of information contained in this memo would give support (or cause) to dismantle the Russia investigation? Surely when there is an investigation of the sort we're undertaking, it would be understandable to have lots of requests to a FISA court for surveillance? And wouldn't those requests be coming from the investigating bodies?\n\nIt's all very confusing. Wouldn't it have to be individually damning for targeting for something to rise to the level of calling for removal of a person or persons from the FBI? For example, if Investigator X was running FISA requests on his own ex-girlfriend or something.\n"
"The memo has been classified as Top Secret. In order to release it legally, a number of steps have to be taken, including a vote by the House Intelligence Committee and allowing the Administration a brief period to review and raise objections. Also - the memo has only been viewed in a secure facility so it's likely that no one going on record actually has a copy of the memo available to leak.\n\nOr - following the *Feinstein Protocol*, they can simply get a doctor's note saying they have a cold. Then they would be free to post it on their Twitter feed."
'A bunch of people in government have been saying this circulating memo is incredibly damning because it describes what one guy called "KGB"-like government surveillance. On who or what is not immediately clear, but TD is assuming its confirming Trump was wiretaped like he claimed. Fox news has started heavily running the story at the same time linked russian accounts have started circulating it online. The OP seems convinced this is a smokescreen with which Trump might use to disband the special counsel\'s investigation. '

'What your cult mind fails to recognize, is that building a case like this happens in stages... Like a play or a movie. \n\nStage one set the story in motion. Our country was influenced by foreign agents, too smart for our own right wing oligarchs, and they worked together to establish power and earn a loyal cult of personality from their simple minded followers. You found an identity in the base imagery and catchy head apparel, and stepped in line like a mentally disadvantaged sheep from Wallace and Gromit. \n\nStage two is where the story arc starts to level out. Static and dynamic characters begin to take shape. We see who is going to find their moral center and fall on the sword for the greater good. And who will fail to evolve, and go down with the proverbial ship.  \n\nStage three is coming. Its the best part. Youre gonna wanna close up Infowars, and give the screen your full undivided attention (Im guessing youll never see the M. Night twist on this one). \n\nPeople like you are extras in this feature. You help color the background atmosphere of all those on the wrong side of history. Youre the guy in the crowd yelling at the black girl going to a newly integrated school, or the guy standing and cheering as the starving immigrant fleeing genocide is turned back at the border. Nobody remembers your face, but you add to the encompassing sense of hate and weakness (in reality youre likely just some troll farmer from Russia or Idaho, but the overarching point still stands). \n\nThe way this ends is, the political pendulum swings back hard and a new center is found, much closer to true north in the ethical sense. Your "movement" has basically only served to shine a black light on the semen stains of our political culture. Mueller and his team are housekeeping for Motel USA. Take light in this fact though: you arent relevant enough to even be that semen stain; youre just proudly wearing its jersey and promoting it in reddit forums. '

Because of #1, my guess is that the FBI wants to see what things Trump will grant Kushner "need to know" when he clearly does not... and they\'ll add that to the complete picture of Trump\'s activities.'

"Israel created duqu 2.0 to spy on Hillary Clinton and the Iran deal, JCPOA. Russia found Israel's malware and used it too. So both Israel and Russia were in state systems and using it to influence our democracy. Russia's online army is 1/10th Israel's. Through AIPAC israelis gave nearly 180 million to the election. Trump met the Russian lawyer and Netanyahu all in the same time then shortly after clibton and the dncs dirt got put out. Israel already had everything wikileaks and DCLeaks had from spying on the Iran deal. Russia would of had it too after finding Israel's Kaspersky flaw. Since trump won, russia hasn't had sanctions installed. Israel got Jerusalem, a 18% increase in free American money, the UN changed so no one is hokding Israel accountable for their take over of Palestine, and has got almost full control over the Iran deal to dictate it on ameticas behalf. Also, Russia Israeli trade and business has gone up 12% since all of this 😤"

'They likely will play the ‘we wanted to stop him but the Democrats wouldn’t let us’ card.  \n\nThat will play well with the NeverTrump Republicans, and will seem plausible as an escape hatch for the Trumpians who want out. '
'Pence would be poor candidate. He would carry the baggage of the impeachent/resignation and not have the advantage of running a an incumbent (this cost Ford). Unlike Trump he\'s a poor public speaker, uncharismatic. He\'s not very competent, he\'s an religious extremist. He would lose.\n\nIf Trump runs he will probably be re-elected (do not wish this but it is what it ise) *if* the economy holds up. Advantages:\n\n* Generally, people get tired of Party X if it\'s been in power for eight years or more. The new party then is usually given a full eight years before the people get tired of *them*. The one exception is Carter (before that, Grover Cleveland, and I\'m not even sure about that). This greatly favors Trump.\n\n* Remember, some people voted for Al Gore but then decided "Well, after seeing George W. Bush\'s first term, I\'m switching to him" (!) If *George Bush* can do this then Trump can.\n\n* Trump is a *terrible* President, but he\'s an excellent public speaker and a good campaigner.\n\n* We can assume the same treatment from Russian bots and trolls, and the same voter suppression. An maybe the Russians can hack the voting machines,\n\nIf the economy tanks, Trump will lose anyway. If it\'s pretty good, he\'ll probably win. If there\'s a big Muslim terrorist attack in America near the election, he will win in a landslide. Pence would probably lose.'
'Well, he was asked if it affected the election and he said he wouldn\'t get into the impact, but they didn\'t see evidence that votes were changed.\n\nUnder the way he\'s defining it, he\'s allowing that enough Americans may have chosen Trump or shown up for Trump because of propaganda that it put him over the top, but they aren\'t even attempting to assess that.  I sincerely don\'t know if I believe him or not, but I can understand why they might not get into such a tough hypothetical questions like "Would people have elected Trump anyway absent Russian propaganda".'
"If Trump is removed I doubt Pence would even run. \n\n> excellent public speaker\n\nTrump is a terrible public speaker by any objective measure. He rambles endlessly and can barely form a coherent sentence. BING BING BING. I'll grant that his speaking is POPULAR with his base.\n\nThe investigation is still a big wild card. Anything could happen."
'That sounds like a big number, but look at his razor thin victory margin and his abysmal public approval rating. Primaries are decided by party loyalists but generals are decided by independents and swing voters.\n\nBesides, the other shoe has yet to drop. '
'Well i mean popular *is* good, almost by definition, when you\'re talking about public speaking with the intent to persuade. \n\nTrump has a way of ending statements with like "...and it\'s very, very easy. We\'re going to do it and we\'re going to do it very quickly". He drops his pitch and volume in a "turning away" way that communicates "I mean of course we\'re going to do it. That\'s so obviously true that it\'s really not even worth saying. Only an idiot can\'t see that. You\'re not a idiot, are you?" It\'s the equivalent of a math professor handwaving with "...and after that, the solution is trivial".\n\nJust because he\'s a bad *person* doesn\'t mean he\'s a bad *campaigner*. He is. I mean Hitler was an effective public speaker too.'
"Hitler's skill as an orator puts Trump to absolute shame. They're not even in the same league. You don't even have to speak German to grok the difference, e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnpTWKKWQ1o He's one of history's greatest monsters but he's also a damn good orator.\n\nWhat they DO have in common in their speaking is the effective use of [demagoguery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogue).\n\n*better video"
"I won't discount the possibility that he wins another term. I won't even discount the possibility that he calls for a violent revolt, or moves to amend the constitution to eliminate presidential term limits and fixes however many elections he lives for. I didn't think he had a chance in hell of being president but here he is in all his orange glory. I'm confident things will get better, somebody, but they could get a lot worse in the meantime.\n\nThis is interesting reading, and slightly comforting, given that demagogues historically usually come to bad end, but discomforting to think about who they take with them https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogue"

That way, when he abuses his power to hinder the investigation, those supporters will remember the words “witch hunt” and think he’s doing the right thing.\n\nHe doesn’t need to convince you, or me, or anyone else who thinks critically. He just has to keep convincing his base that he’s right and everyone else is wrong, because even though that’s completely false, the republicans will stick with him while he holds sway with their voters.\n\nIt’s the same reason campaign slogans are short, simple and repeated ad nauseam... because it’s effective.'

'The daily show used to be awesome at this.'
'President Trump literally chose to believe the word a foreign dictator over American intelligence agencies. Then he refused to enforce sanctions adopted with near-unanimous approval by Congress.

How is that not being a traitor???\n\nAnyone who still supports President Trump is knowingly supporting someone who has placed the interests of himself and Russia before his own country. How is that any different than being a traitor themselves?'

'To set precedence.  The smaller ones can’t defend themselves.

It is a shame because the indies were not beholden to large corporate advertisers.  They have gone after the big ones as well like PewDiePie.  What they do is demonetize their content during the first few days of posting, it gets reviewed and put back on but the views have already happened.  This happened to H3H3 as well, some are jumping ship.  YouTube is slowing becoming another cable network.  '
"Former POTUS Nixon was pardoned pre-emptively, before any charges were brought against him.  What's stopping Donald from doing that? He could issue a pre-emptive blanket pardon for any and all federal crimes committed by Michael  Cohen, no?\n\nEither Donald isn't aware he can do that, or he has no intention of pardoning him.  If Donald pardons Michael, then Michael can not use the 5th. Incriminating himself is impossible at that point, and he would be compelled to testify.\n\nIs that the fly in the ointment?  Sorry, not really up on US law."
'He will still gas light the shit out of us.'
"Michael Cohen is in an impossible situation.  He's sandwiched between a corrupt mob-boss of a President and the unlimited resources of S.C. Mueller.  And he has done some awful things for himself and many others.\n\nAs powerful as the Presidency is, it's not unlimited.  As many have mentioned, Trump could issue a pardon for any and all crimes committed at the federal level. And while this might be great for Dinesh Douchebag D'souza, who had a quite uncomplicated conviction to vacate, Michael Cohen is another story. \n\nMichael Cohen is likely staring at not only federal charges but charges in other jurisdictions.  That includes NY state and who knows what other states.  It's not like Michael Cohen only committed crimes in New York.  In addition, he likely has committed crimes in other countries and is eligible to be extradited.  On top of that, even if Cohen is pardoned at the federal level, that doesn't make all of the evidence taken from his office, home, etc. go away.  It's still there and it implicates dozens, probably hundreds of other people.\n\nBottom line, Michael Cohen, like Paul Manafort, is a treasure trove of information and evidence and whether they receive a federal pardon or not is almost immaterial."
"Yo I know it feels like that, but you need to remember that nearly 50&#37; of the country does not vote.  Considering Spanky and Hillary nearly split the election, that's 25&#37; each.    \n\n\nIt's very important to recognize that vast majority that doesn't vote because it absolutely caused Spanky to win. If no one votes, and there's a surge of any kind (including a surge of a bunch of assholes), then that surge can easily put someone over the top.  "
'**Michael Cohen is an American attorney who worked as a lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump. Prior to that he was a Vice President of the Trump Organization.**\n\n**The Trump–Russia dossier, published in January 2017, alleges that Cohen met with Russian officials in Prague, Czech Republic in 2016 with the objective of paying those who had hacked the DNC and to "cover up all traces of the hacking operation".** Cohen has denied the allegations against him, stating that he was in Los Angeles between August 23 and 29, and in New York for the entire month of September. According to a Czech intelligence source, there is no record of him entering Prague by plane, but Respekt magazine and Politico pointed out that he could have entered by car or train from a neighboring country within the Schengen Area, for example Italy. In the latter case, a record of Cohen entering the Schengen zone from a non-Schengen country should exist.\n\n**However, on April 13, 2018, the DC Bureau of McClatchy Newspapers reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has evidence that Cohen did travel to Prague during the late-summer of 2016, with two sources having confirmed this secret trip. The evidence is said to show that Cohen entered the Czech Republic from Germany, and since both countries are in European Union\'s Schengen passport area, Cohen would not have received a passport stamp to enter Czech territory.** The following day, Cohen again denied he has "ever been to Prague". Cohen also said that he didn\'t travel to the European Union in August 2016.\n\n**In late January 2017, Cohen met with Ukrainian opposition politician Andrey Artemenko and Felix Sater at the Loews Regency in Manhattan to discuss a plan to lift sanctions against Russia.** The proposed plan would require that Russian forces withdraw from eastern Ukraine and that Ukraine hold a referendum on whether Crimea should be "leased" to Russia for 50 or 100 years. **Cohen was given a written proposal in a sealed envelope that he delivered to then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn in early February.**\n\n**On April 3, 2017, Cohen was appointed a National Deputy Finance Chairman of the Republican National Committee.** In April 2017, Cohen also formed an alliance with Squire Patton Boggs for legal and lobbying counsel on behalf of Trump.\n\nIn May 2017, amidst expanding inquiries into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, two congressional panels asked Cohen to provide information about any communications he had with people connected to the Russian government. **He was also a subject of the Mueller investigation in 2018.**\n\n**In 2017, an LLC that Cohen established received $500,000 from Columbus Nova, a US offshoot of businesses owned by Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg.** Vekselberg is a business partner of Soviet-born billionaire and major Republican Party donor, Leonard Blavatnik. **In March 2018, members from Robert Mueller\'s team of special counsel investigators questioned Vekselberg at a New York area airport. In April 2018, the United States imposed sanctions on him and 23 other Russian nationals.**'

'Again this is all just speculation hypothetical but what the heck...If Trump pardons, I assume it will be a "blanket" pardon for "all crimes."  Then all that is left is state level charges in New York *if* those can even be brought.\n\nOn the other hand, Cohen spills the beans before he is pardoned because he gets spooked that he won\'t get one.  But even if this happens we don\'t even know what beans he has to spill.\n\nRight now he just seems to be trolling for reactions either from prosecutors or from Trump. '

"Man so if you're into Marvel at all you know that after Black Panther is Infinity War which is like the culmination of every marvel movie to this point. Looking at all the different players in this story and the vast span of time it takes place over, I would love an MCU type of thing that really fleshes out each part of the story and each person in it. And each movie would be really good too, there is SO MUCH to work with, there's like 15 amazing Scorcese worthy stories in this thing that are just sub-plots and you could slowly build up to the big moment."

"It was shorter yesterday when I first saw it, and at that point it went from oldest to newest.  I think it's pretty fresh and they're still working it out."
"I think there is a breaking point. And I think you are starting to see some of that on the Senate side. The republican base is a demographic time bomb. And at some point in time, the plutocrats who fund the machine-e.g. Koch Bros- are going to realize the shoe will inevitably be on the other foot.\n\nIn the context of that other great historical republic, it is worthy to note that Caesar's ascension (who rose to power as a force for the plebian 'little guy'), would not have been possible had in not been for the preceding Dictatorship of Sulla (who represented the interests of Patrician monied interests). One instability lead to the other, and eventually to the demise of the constitution altogether.  Our countries founders, whom were avid historians (remember vol. I of Gibbon was published in 1776)  were deeply afraid of just such a scenario, which is why we have the system of checks and balances in the first place.   \n\nGood example of this in the present context, are the drastic reduction of state income tax offsets-- basically forcing the blue states to fund the tax cuts for the rich Republican party backers.  So imagine the wheel turns and the Democrats have the house, senate and executive.  Whats going to happen when they want to restore the deduction and fund it with say... a massive tax hike on the oil industry.   \n\nPoint is that you get too far afield from the system of checks and balances -- even under this administration -- you risk an equal but opposite reaction when the shoe is on the other foot, which history says will eventually happen. \n\nThis is a longwinded way of saying that the breaking point will not come from the party hacks. It will instead come from the mega-rich, who will simply get scared.  And even if change doesnt happen immediately, and especially under the present regime, they would do especially well to remember the fate of Mikhail Khodorkovsky in Putin's Russia. "
'Why don’t more people like you post on Reddit? I need to get on better subs. '
"I question whether or not its accurate.  I'm hoping you or someone here can clarify the following point:\n\n>Summer 2014 - Citing his contacts with Russian operatives in 2013, the FBI obtains a warrant under the **Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act** to surveil Carter Page’s communications.\n\nhttps://themoscowproject.org/collusion/fbi-begins-monitoring-carter-pages-communications/\n\nThe reference for this point on the timeline says nothing of a FISA in 2014... only the FISA in 2016.  I was under the impression that Carter Page was under surveillance but specifically it was NOT a FISA?  There is nothing in Moscow Project to prove 2014 was a FISA other than their headline.  Can anyone else provide evidence for that claim because I think its an important distinction.  \n"
"It's a grey area.  I don't fly the flag, but I think, for them, it's a symbol of being free and not particularly politically correct.  It's also an extremely attractive flag. I know plenty of veterans that fly the stars and bars.  "
"I'm just trying to help people understand the mindset of people that fly the flag.  I've known people that have done it.  I don't do it myself.  I honestly can't see myself ever holding the rebel battle flag outside a reenactment.  I just want to make that very clear.  \n\nFormer slaves might very well object to the flag symbolizing freedom, but there are different perspectives.  If you watch something like 'The Dukes Hazard' that's also a perspective.  It might be a little outdated, but it's a thing.    \n\nRead this quote attributed to H. L. Mencken.\n\n'Every normal man must be tempted at times to spit on his hands, hoist the black flag, and begin to slit throats.'\n\nThat's to some extent what a lot of them are saying with their little flags.  It's a rejection of societies rules and standards.  \n"
"Well yes, it's a fringe group.  Look, you'll always have people that try to stage their little personal rebellions in any society.  Trying to spit in the eye of god or whatever.  Thumb their nose at authority, for example. They like to try and stand out of from the herd.  That is what the flag is to them.  It's like a dumb tattoo.     "

(As for whether it ever was that....just let me hold onto one happy lie in these difficult times). Progressivism and Conservatism are supposed to be pieces that go together, not opposites that pull at one another.\n\nOh well. Maybe one day I can believe in balancing the budget without the extra baggage of being expected to hate non-white people.'
'If a balanced budget is your fiscal conservatism, and it doesn’t involve massive tax breaks for the wealthy or cutting social safety net programs we can be fiscal allies as well. I just hold issue if you don’t see a problem with our society not funding healthcare and higher education as a matter of principal. However the fact show that highly educated healthy populations are more financially beneficial to a labor force, so I would assume we have common ground there as well. \n\nI’m glad to meet a non-crazy conservative Christian. I sometimes forget that people like you exist, because the overwhelming majority of my personal experiences with people who share your faith and political identifier are terrifying. So well met indeed, let’s be allies in the fight to make America a better place.'
"I can't help but point out that both Trump and Putin are *very* capitalist, so the hammer and sickle iconography seems kind of... eh."
"This exact sentiment was put out in pics as well. The USSR used the Hmer and Sickle on their flag, and that's where most people know it from. You can say whatever you want about what the Hammer and Sickle is *supposed* to mean, but frankly it's pretty irrelevant considering the USSR used it despite definitely not working towards those ends.\n\nIt's important to note this, because Putin was in the KGB where he worked to support the USSR. He earned all of the negative connotations associated with the USSR and by extension the Hammer and Sickle as it is best known- a symbol of authoritarian rule the style of which Putin is VERY much a fan of."
"That's fair, but honestly, when I think ussr, I think authoritarianism first and communism second"

'That’s because nobody truly respects him.'
"That's surprising to me. I interacted with a lot of Marines - as my Navy command hosted quite a few - none of them liked Trump. Trump's very unpopular among young people in general; I think you'd have to try pretty hard to find someone that likes him in active duty, so it's surprising that everyone you knew would like him."

"I was a part of the intelligent crowd also, like that's the most surprising part. I wasnt motor t or a grunt I was air wing haha"
'The behavior at T_D isn’t so much genuine respect as it is fanatical idolization of somebody upon whose they can project all of their hopes and disdains and always hear a “yes” answer.\n\nThink of it like courtship. When two responsible people see one-another, they have realistic expectations of the other person and respect boundaries, etc.\n\nWhen morally repugnant, emotionally flaccid people (T_Ders) see somebody even remotely appealing, rather than assess the individual, they’ll be more likely to just assume this person is everything they need and more.\n\nTrump’s cult doesn’t respect him. Arguably, they don’t even admire him. Most accurately, they fetishize him and the idea of his presidency because it gives them hope they’ll get what they want.'
"Ah, gotcha. I was a cook so I pretty much interacted with everyone, I wasn't really limited to just one part of the crew."
'Trump immediately responded, "Thanks, Vladdy!"\n\nThe funny thing about this is that if he had just come out, told the American people, and resigned before he could be inaugurated, he\'d be seen as a fucking American hero by almost everyone. But nope, too desperate for power and money.'

'**Hillary Clinton email controversy**\n\nThe Hillary Clinton email controversy was a major public controversy arising from the use by  Hillary Clinton of her family\'s private email server for official communications during her tenure as United States Secretary of State rather than official State Department email accounts maintained on secure federal servers. Those official communications included over 100 emails which contained classified information (but did not have classification markings) at the time they were sent, as well as 2,093 emails which were not marked classified but would retroactively be ranked as "confidential" by the State Department. Post-election analyses of media coverage during the 2016 presidential campaign show that the Clinton email controversy received the most extensive coverage of any topic.The controversy unfolded against the backdrop of Clinton\'s 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the United States House Select Committee on Benghazi. Some experts, officials, and members of Congress contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures, as well as federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

'> President Donald Trump\'s lead lawyer, John Dowd, has resigned from the President\'s personal legal team handling the response to the Russia investigation.\n\n> Dowd\'s resignation comes as Trump has stepped up his attacks on special counsel Robert Mueller and days after Dowd said in a statement the investigation should end, initially claiming he was speaking for the President before saying he was only speaking for himself.\n\nJumping from the sinking ship.\n\n> "I love the President and wish him well,"\n\nDowd said in a statement to CNN\'s Gloria Borger.\n\n> "John Dowd is a friend and has been a valuable member of our legal team. We will continue our ongoing representation of the President and our cooperation with the Office of Special Counsel," said Jay Sekulow, counsel to the President.\n\n\nFrom the Washington Post \n\n> Trump added former U.S. attorney Joe diGenova to his legal team last week.

'The BEST'
'**THE BEST PEOPLE**'
"In his mind, trump thinks fighting IS winning. In life, he gets away with it because of the money he has. Even when loses, he never feels it cause he's still rich and he tells himself he won afterwards. So he has spent all of his life acting like a jackass doing anything he wants and thinking he's winning when he's actually losing.\n\nSo for him to say no to mueller's interview is unimaginable. He would view that as losing. His mind works based off on a win/lose mentality and that fighting in of itself is winning. For once in his life maybe he will see what losing really is"
"> I'm sure he quit because of how innocent Trump is, right?\n\nDo you even know how lawyers work?"
'I think trump appearing in front of Mueller could be the very best piece of video ever.'
"At his level they'll decline a paycheck to protect their reputation as well.  Working for the POTUS is fantastic at getting you other high-powered clients as long as it isn't *this* POTUS.  Nobody wants to hire the lawyer whose client was impeached and potentially jailed."
'the prequel was pretty good! '
'I mean a candidate basically colluding with a foreign adversary to win the presidency should be way bigger of a history lesson for generations. But like you said, I feel like the era of post-truth will make it seem just less than important than Watergate was.'
'> I keep imagining a kid learning about all this awful stuff in school and then going home to grandpa to talk about it. Whereupon Grandpa starts ranting about how Trump was the greatest president ever.\n\nI think the vast majority of the MAGA people will distance themselves from Trump once he\'s proven to be completely ineffective (which thankfully he is, barely passing one piece of legislation with both houses of Congress ostensibly on his side) and when Mueller takes him down with hard proof that he worked with Putin they\'ll immediately pretend they never liked him that much anyway.  \n\nThese aren\'t people with long attention spans or strong convictions other than rooting for their "team", once their team has a new captain they\'ll move on from the old one pretty quickly IMHO.'
"> For instance, a lawyer may be required to resign if he knows his client intends to commit perjury. It’s actually a complicated issue when balanced with a lawyer’s duty to zealously defend a client.\n\nLawyer here. This is almost certainly what's going on. It's a signal that Dowd is very, very sure that Trump would commit a crime (e.g., perjury or obstruction of justice). In that circumstance, he would have an ethical obligation to report on his own client. No attorney wants to do that--it's horribly injurious to your reputation and will understandably put you in a ton of hot water with the bar, who's going to micro-analyze everything that led up to the predicament. And if you have a client like Trump, good lord. He would sue you in every way possible.\n\nSo yeah, he's resigning before he triggers his ethical obligation to narc on his boi.\n\nIf I were Dowd, I'd be putting my malpractice insurance carrier on notice ASAP. That would be a hilarious letter. \n\n> Dear Insurance Company, \n\n> You see this shit on the news? Yeah. All that.\n\n> Holla back,\n\n> Johnny D"

"When an intelligence community expresses a high level of certainty it is meaningless without proof. It is a phrase used deliberately to mislead the public on things they can't hope to prove, but want to move the public on anyway.

"I think you perfectly captured the essence of most people's response to this. I wish I had a more upvotes to give you.\n\nEven if someone were still somehow on the fence about the Russia conspiracy, there's no way they would support Trump on this. "
"There's not enough support for something like that to ever happen. Sudden coups might have worked before the internet but today he'd need the total backing of the people or the army, neither of which are realistic. \n\nOne of the real positives to a democratic republic like ours is that no one can assume that kind of power without consent. And while we may not like Trump, the only reason he's in office is because he technically gained that consent. But people like Mueller and several governors across the union are clearly challenging his power and weakening him daily. "
'All he needs to do is put more fuel on this “the deep state is out to get me” fire that the Russian trolls started and a lot of Amendment 2 people become his militia.\n\nI think this feeds in to his inaction on securing our elections.  \n\nWhat’s the best way to consolidate power?  Claim the next election is illegitimate because of Russian hacking.  So therefore he wouldn’t need to leave office until this issue is resolved.  So the move would be to have the Russians do sloppy hacking that made it clear the election was illegitimate.  '

"1. It's cite, not site. \n\n2. It's in the article. \n\n3. Read the article before trying to debunk it. \n\n4. Reading and understanding someone else's argument is the first step to debating it.

That's not rational thinking, it's an emotional knee jerk reaction. \n\n5. Even if this were legal, would that make it OK?

">My name is Stephanie Clifford (aka Stormy Daniels).\n>\n>I am attempting to speak honestly and openly to the American people about my relationship with now President Donald Trump, as well as the intimidation and tactics that he, together with his attorney Michael Cohen, have used to silence me.\n>\n>In order to tell my story, I have had to file a public lawsuit in Los Angeles, California in an effort to void a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) that Mr. Trump never signed and yet is trying to use to intimidate me.\n>\n>Rather than agree that the NDA is invalid, thus allowing me to talk, Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen have instead attempted to hide the facts from the public using a bogus arbitration proceeding and have threatened me with millions of dollars in damages ($1M each time I speak out) if I tell the truth about what happened.\n>\n>I recently made an offer to return the $130,000 I was previously paid if it was agreed that I could simply tell the truth publicly.  Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen did not even bother to respond. \n>\n>I need funds to pay for:  attorneys' fees; out-of-pocket costs associated with the lawsuit, arbitration, and my right to speak openly; security expenses; and damages that may be awarded against me if I speak out and ultimately lose to Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen.\n>\n>I am more fortunate than many, many people in this country.  And for that I am grateful.  But unfortunately, I do not have the vast resources to fight Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen alone.

'I think Trump is one of the worst examples of the human species, but forgive me if my respect for a self promoting opportunist (sound familiar?) is just as low.\n\nIf she wants to do this she will do it without my help.'
'Bold move.  I really hope this comes through.  '
"So if you have no money, even if the courts award a judgement to Trump/Cohen, which will take YEARS, they can't collect on a civil suit if you don't have anything. You file for bankruptcy and they get nothing. Done. That's if you lose... If you win, it's a whole different ball game. "
'“We could have easily gone out and secretly raised millions from a number of ‘fat cat’ donors who don’t like the president,” Avenatti told The Post on Wednesday. “But that isn’t in the spirit of what this is about.”'
'> The dirt she has may actually help in getting Trump impeached.\n\nOf all the shit we know him and his cronies are stealing, we are going to impeach him over 130k in a campaign finance work around? \n\nCome on now. No one who will be in Congress 11 months from now when there is any real chance of impeachment gives that much of a shit about campaign finance laws. '
"It's more.  She may possible have pictures and text messages.  Trump's supporters will deny this story because they will claim there is no evidence.  If she can break the NDA agreement and release evidence of her relationship with Trump, including the pictures and text messages, it will have huge impacts on his presidency.  Not to mention if there is hard evidence, it can effectively torpedo the Republicans in the November elections (with hard evidence, many Evangelical Christians that held their nose to vote for Trump may decide to sit out the elections in November).\n\nBTW, I see you post often in AskTrumpSupporters and The_Donald.  I can see why you don't want her to tell her story and produce the evidence of her relationship with Trump."
"What does She gain from it though? Why does she want to end the NDA? I'm a little out of the loop."
'I don’t care about who trump has sex with as long as it’s not children, and thus far only rumors of his pedophaelia have come out. What is salacious about this story is that the president of the United States was blackmailed for over a hundred thousand dollars and then—while continuing to talk about how rich he is—he illegally siphoned money from his campaign to pay off the blackmail. I know if I donated to trump, I would be irked knowing that my donations were funding blackmail threats from porn stars.'
"No one cares about Putin..... well you clearly don't as you just care about getting in other rich people that fuck you over.\n\nits comical to watch"
'This is pretty much the beginning of the end. I mean can we please accept that Avenatti is a spook? That the intelligence community figure this crap out months ago and has just been tying it up and trying to find a way to spring it on the American people.  If a British dude with limited resources figured this out so quickly, you don\'t think the spooks could? Come on.  Trump colluded. He laundered. Yawn.  We now have an account that links trump to stormy to public corruption to Russian oligarchs.  This is this first "proof" they will give us.  What else can Avenatti the brilliant lawyer by day, playboy by night, race car driver on the weekends tell us?\n\nThis is all coming to end quick like. Next will be the release of the  SARs reports from the treasury which will show three more transactions from cohen company that the treasury secretary(trumps guy) has been dragging his feet on. '
"Why would Mueller give Avanetti this information? Not a lawyer but that seems like confidential information, and Mueller doesnt seem to be the leaking type. He's to careful to do anything that's shaky.\n\n  What's the legal rationale? "
'Mueller doesn\'t leak, but the administration does. Also, Mueller is "spearfishing" remember? He wouldn\'t hand over a list with inaccuracies in it. \n\nMy guess is these came from some disgruntled employee in the Treasury department. '
'Let’s hope the Trump supporters take the streets once all his friends are marched to prison. '
'You do know that the same "Russia Oligarch" also paid millions to the Clinton\'s. Viktor Vekselberg and his Renova group. The left news sources always say "Russia Oligarch" in a attempt to disconnect him from the Clinton\'s.. but its that same POS. Sounds like he was playing both sides so he could win no matter what.  So basically both Hilary and Trump were paid by Russians.  So that are the same in that sense, except, the Clinton\'s got more....'
"So the Clintons got Viktor Vekselberg to donate to the Clinton Foundation, a legitimate charity that does good work. The Clinton Foundation is a top rated charity by all organizations that independently rate charities. The GOP has had the FBI investigate the Clinton Foundation in 2016 and found nothing.  \n  \nOn the other hand, Viktor Vekselberg put money into Trump's personal lawyer's fake shell company. Cohen is not really a practicing lawyer. He graduated from the worst law school in the country, and has only one client, Trump. Cohen's shell company is used for paying hush money to porn stars and playboy bunnies who needed abortions."
"Where ever there's a Clinton link to Russians, the Trump links are much stronger. The Russian bank hired Podesta group (run by the brother of john podesta) to lobby about sanctions. However, Trump's cabinet secretary, Wilbur Ross, OWNED the bank, and even selected a guy from Deutsche Bank who was busted for Russian money laundering to run the operations at Bank of Cyprus, presumable to launder more Russian money. Manafort had accounts there to launder money. And Wilbur Ross is confirmed to have helped Trump launder Russian money in the 2008 real estate deal with a Russian oligarch who over-paid about $60 million dollars for a Trump mansion. The deal was facilitated by Wilbur Ross, and as soon as the Russian bought it, he bulldozed it, pretty much confirming that it was to launder money. It was the most expensive home sale in the United States."

"That's an interesting question.  I don't know, but I would think that the answer would be;\n\n* Yes, he can be granted immunity unilaterally.\n\n* No, he can't be forced to answer if granted that immunity.\n\nBetter to make the immunity contingent on cooperation.\n\nIf that was not the case, prosecutors could just grant a blanket immunity to all people in an organization -- but not their targets.  This could backfire if the people targeted are actually innocent while some of the people given immunity aren't.  At that point, the guilty (non-targeted) would just tell what they did and they would get away with it.\n\nThere are other possible failures if this was possible, but these at least would be an issue."
"I made this comment in anouther thread:\n\nIt might mean he's innocent of what he's accused of, but to make statements on it, he might admit to guilt in other crimes.\n\ni.e. No officer, I didn't kill my wife, I couldn't of, I was killing her sister at that time.\n\n(I think he's guilty, but that's for the courts to prove)\n\nAditionally, the Fifth is an important right, to quote wikipedia: this evidentiary privilege ensures that defendants cannot be compelled to become witnesses at their own trials."
'> Defense: "If I answer that question, it will incriminate me as having taken part in the crime. Therefore, I invoke my right to not do that."\n\nYou don\'t have to be guilty of the crime you\'re accused of (or any other crime), to plead the 5th, you just need to have reasonable cause to fear that your testimony might  falsely implicate you in some crime.\n\n> The Supreme Court of Ohio here held that a witness who denies all culpability does not have a valid Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Because **[our precedents dictate that the privilege protects the innocent as well as the guilty](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/532/17.html)**, and that the facts here are sufficient to sustain a claim of privilege, we grant the petition for certiorari and reverse.\n\n> ...\n\n> We have held that the privilege\'s protection extends only to witnesses who have "reasonable cause to apprehend danger from a direct answer." Id., at 486. That inquiry is for the court; the witness\' assertion does not by itself establish the risk of incrimination. Ibid. A danger of "imaginary and unsubstantial character" will not suffice. Mason v. United States, 244 U. S. 362, 366 (1917). But we have never held, as the Supreme Court of Ohio did, that the privilege is unavailable to those who claim innocence. To the contrary, we have emphasized that one of the Fifth Amendment\'s "basic functions ... is to protect innocent men ... \'who otherwise might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.\' " Grunewald v. United States, 353 U. S. 391, 421 (1957) (quoting Slochower v. Board of Higher Ed. of New York City, 350 U. S. 551, 557-558 (1956)) (emphasis in original). In Grunewald, **we recognized that truthful responses of an innocent witness, as well as those of a wrongdoer, may provide the government with incriminating evidence from the speaker\'s own mouth**. 353 U.

"Don't ever forget that this conversation between Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy were recorded:\n\n>In the transcript published by the Post, McCarthy speculates that the Russians hacked the Democratic National Committee’s computers and, in the process, discovered whatever opposition-research materials the Democrats had gathered on Trump.\n\n>“There’s two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump,” McCarthy said, according to Entous, a superb reporter who heard a tape recording of the colloquy. “Swear to God.”\n\n>McCarthy’s remark is met with laughter, and Ryan cautions his colleagues, “This is an off the record . . . No leaks! . . . All right?”\n\n>And then, amid more laughter, Ryan says, “This is how we know we’re a real family here.”\n\n>“That’s how you know that we’re tight,” Steve Scalise, the House Majority Whip, says.\n\n>“What’s said in the family stays in the family,” Ryan concludes.\n\nThis needs to be played by any candidate who runs against McCarthy or Scalise (Ryan has chosen not to run again).

'*Wall of text, but you did ask...*\n\nThe hacking spree that upended the presidential election wasn’t limited to Democratic National Committee memos and Clinton-aide emails posted on websites. The hacker also privately sent Democratic voter-turnout analyses to a Republican political operative in Florida named Aaron Nevins.\n\nLearning that hacker “Guccifer 2.0” had tapped into a Democratic committee that helps House candidates, Mr. Nevins wrote to the hacker to say: “Feel free to send any Florida based information.”\n\nTen days later, Mr. Nevins received 2.5 gigabytes of Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee documents, some of which he posted on a blog called HelloFLA.com that he ran using a pseudonym.\n\nSoon after, the hacker sent a link to the blog article to Roger Stone, a longtime informal adviser to then-candidate Donald Trump, along with Mr. Nevins’ analysis of the hacked data. \n\nMr. Nevins confirmed his exchanges after The Wall Street Journal identified him first as the operator of the HelloFLA blog and then as the recipient of the stolen DCCC data. The Journal also reviewed copies of exchanges between the hacker and Mr. Nevins. That the obscure blog had received hacked Democratic documents was previously known, but not the extent of the trove or the blogger’s identity.\n\n“I just threw an arrow in the dark,” Mr. Nevins said in an interview, adding he set up a Dropbox account so whoever was using the Guccifer 2.0 name could send large amounts of material. Later, going through what the hacker sent as someone who “actually knows what some of these documents mean,” the GOP consultant said he “realized it was a lot more than even Guccifer knew that he had.”\n\nThe episode shows how the hacker’s activities extended to exposing Democrats’ get-out-the vote strategies in swing states and informing a Trump ally of hacked data during the national campaign.\n\nU.S. officials believe Guccifer 2.0 is linked to Russian military intelligence. Guccifer 2.0 denies that. The moniker appeared in hacks last year and isn’t the same as a Romanian hacker who earlier used the “Guccifer” name.\n\nA Federal Bureau of Investigation counterintelligence inquiry and congressional committees are looking into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The Kremlin denies any election meddling, including any link to Guccifer 2.0. Mr. Stone has come under scrutiny in the counterintelligence inquiry, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Stone denied any involvement with the Russians related to elections and said he hadn’t been contacted by the FBI. He confirmed that Guccifer 2.0 sent him a link to the HelloFLA blog article last year but said he didn’t share any hacked material from it with anyone. On his own website, Mr. Stone has posted screenshots of text messages he exchanged with Guccifer 2.0 last summer.\n\nDCCC documents sent to Mr. Nevins analyzed specific Florida districts, showing how many people were dependable Democratic voters, how many were likely Democratic voters but needed a nudge, how many were frequent voters but not committed, and how many were core Republican voters—the kind of data strategists use in planning ad buys and other tactics.\n\nThe Journal reviewed these documents as well as Democratic voter analyses also sent to Mr. Nevins about congressional districts in Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nThe DCCC last summer confirmed a cyberintrusion but hasn’t been specific about what was taken. Asked for comment, DCCC Communications Director Meredith Kelly said federal law enforcement, the intelligence community and members of both parties agree Russia intervened in the presidential and House contests, a reason for “a bipartisan, independent commission to investigate.”\n\nBesides posting some of the hacked material on his blog, Mr. Nevins said he passed some on to Florida journalists. He said he didn’t use any in his consulting business, which includes running grass-roots-style campaigns for corporations and wealthy landowners seeking to influence local politics.\n\nMr. Nevins said the HelloFLA blog, which focuses on Tallahassee political gossip, gets at best 100 readers a day, and he runs it as a hobby.\n\nIn hopes of a scoop, he said, he reached out to Guccifer 2.0 on Aug. 12 after seeing a newspaper article about a hack of the DCCC. The hacker using the Guccifer 2.0 name had invited journalists to send questions via Twitter direct messages, which Mr. Nevins did.\n\nSeeing that some of what Guccifer 2.0 had was months old, Mr. Nevins advised the hacker that releasing fresher documents would have a lot more impact.\n\nMore impressed after studying the voter-turnout models, Mr. Nevins told the hacker, “Basically if this was a war, this is the map to where all the troops are deployed.”\n\nAt another point, he told the hacker, “This is probably worth millions of dollars.”\n\n“Hmmm,” Guccifer 2.0 responded. “ok u owe me a million :)”\n\nDemocrats, Mr. Nevins wrote, “spent millions probably to figure out who these people are that are conducive to their message and now it’s exposed for the other side.”\n\nMr. Stone, to whom Guccifer sent that analysis along with the link to the blog article with DCCC data, wrote to the hacker that the file was “pretty standard,” screenshots of Mr. Stone’s messages show.\n\nIt is impossible to know whether the hack affected the outcome of any elections.\n\n“I did adjust some voting targets based on some data I saw from the leaks,” said Anthony Bustamante, a campaign consultant to Republican congressional candidate Brian Mast. Mr. Bustamante said the Democratic voter analyses led him to amp up some of his TV ad buys and reduce some mailed material ahead of the November election. Mr. Mast won a House seat, previously Democrat-held, in Florida’s 18th district near Palm Beach.\n\nAfter publication, a spokesman for Mr. Mast said Mr. Bustamante stopped working for the Mast campaign on June 30, 2016, before the release of the hacked data, and said he hadn’t made ad buys for the campaign. Asked about that, Mr. Bustamante said he continued to advise the campaign informally after June.\n\nJacob Perry, who managed the Mast general-election campaign, said he wasn’t aware of the use of any hacked data and said it didn’t play a role in the outcome of the race.\n\nRepresentatives of the Florida Republican Party and the National Republican Congressional Committee didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nMr. Nevins said he hasn’t been contacted by any investigators about last year’s political hacking.\n\nHe isn’t convinced the Russians were behind it, Mr. Nevins said, but even if they were, it doesn’t matter to him because the agenda of the hackers seemed to match his own.\n\n“If your interests align,” he said, “never shut any doors in politics.”'

'The Special Counsel is bound by Department of Justice rules to refrain from public comment on continuing investigations and his prosecutor\'s report is to be submitted to his supervisor, not publicly released.  \nCourt filings are typically public and the Special Counsel\'s office has filed those as part of indictments and convictions. Just a reminder: five convictions and an additional 17 indicted is not a "weak" case.  '
"For a party that's supposedly for 'law & Justice' you know suprisingly little about law. But then again, perhaps that's the real explenation."
"A bare majority of people think the Mueller investigation is fair. If Mueller wants to get those numbers up, he should start leaking information. Public opinion might save him, but right now there won't be much backlash against trump who sits at 45%ish approval ratings.\n\nMueller is too good for us."
'So an interesting tidbit you might add to your amazing citations is that Mueller had a warrant for Manafort’s [phone records](https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Politics/muellers-recent-search-warrant-manafort-case-includes-information/story?id=54296092) including multiple phone numbers.  What is interesting about this is that he collected call and location data for each of these numbers.  My guess is that Mueller has gotten warrants for the phones of many other players in this conspiracy which could then put them in certain places at certain times.  This, coupled with CC-TV is likely how Mueller has confirmation that Cohen went to Prague.  Additional contact information obtained from raiding Cohen’s office, house, etc. could have provided additional names paired with phone numbers for different players in this whole affair.'

"> The Clinton and Trump cases have been handled completely different by the FBI.\n\nI agree completely. In one case, the FBI had a massive investigation open for over a year into the one of the biggest crimes against America and we didn't hear a peep about it until 6 months after the election. In the other case there was a computer that wasn't set up using recommended best practices and the FBI continually leaked drivel like the fact they looked at another email today and decided it was boring too.

'I share it literally daily.  I encourage others to do the same.'
'He can be impeached for whatever congress wants and deems “high crimes and misdemeanors”. Take whatever value you want from that and whether it makes you happy or sad. But pardoning oneself makes a good case of an impeachable obstruction of justice (it would not stand in criminal court—doing one of your privileges as president (issuing pardons) is not a criminal act).'
'I think you are sidestepping the point. The sequence of events is important. He must first be impeached (for whatever congress sees fit) and then convicted (a step Clinton and others never made it to). In order for ANY pardon to occur, a conviction must have occurred. In order for Trump to pardon himself, he would have to be convicted, and that can only come after an impeachment. Therefore, he can’t be impeached for pardoning himself because he would have already been impeached if he was in a position to be eligible for pardon. '
"He can pardon himself before a conviction. Ex Parte Garland (1867) held that his pardon power is “unlimited” and “It extends to every offense known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken, or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment.''\n\nMurphy v. Ford (1975), a district court dismissed the suit against Ford for pardoning Nixon before indictment citing Ex Parte Garland. "
"Doesn't matter, vote anyway. What do you know about your congressional district, is it competitive? Is there at least a primary? On top of that, we need to run up the score on the Republicans, make them scared and have to waste resources defending every seat. \n\nBesides, I love voting, it feels great. Even though I don't live in a competitive district. "
'But a reason why it might not be competitive could be that people *feel* it’s not competitive, and do not vote. Obviously this is an edge case, but I’m sure there are some districts where if people were more energetic about voting the tide would turn. Hopefully he does!'
"Never forget the full circle of corruption in the DNC, Lets go back to 2008! Obama Vs Clinton and Tim Kaine as head of the DNC. So Clinton steps out of the race giving it to Obama which then Obama has Kaine step down as DNC head so that way Obama could appoint Clinton's campaign manager  Debbie Wasserman Schultz to head of the DNC. Which she then helped Clinton in the primary and then Clinton made Kaine her VP. I wonder why Clinton after destroying a Progressives campaign would pick such a moderate Dem and think that would help her win. "
"Pretty sure he also voted to confirm all of Trump's nominees too."
"I'm sorry that's the best VA could produce, buuuuuuuuuut he's the best we could produce at the moment. Relax we're coming around slowly but surely okay."
"The departments don't close down without a nominee. Usually they're run by competent civil servants who believe in the agency's mission. Trumps appointees, on the other hand, seem to despise the agencies they run; their main goal is to dismantle & cripple them as much as possible. Voting down nominees is what's best if you want government to function."
"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/23/13703720/dnc-chair-election-rules-members\n\nTurns out that the committee votes, but by tradition they vote for whomever the POTUS selects when POTUS is a dem. The first person POTUS Obama selected was Tim Kaine. \n\nI'm not a Democrat, I've never been a Democrat. I was registered Green until just recently (there was a cute girl in highschool I was trying to impress) but I was a Republican, and then a Libertarian, and then a Republican again (and still a Republican). I don't think that the Democratic leadership is benevolent, I just don't think it's a real scandal for the DNC chair to be an insider with connections, that's pretty much their job."
'Police must educate their staff to not cow tow to performing political tasks like eliminating opposition. Black people (and non-whites) have known through their painful experience with police that officers are capable of demonstrating bias. Executing arrests on political opponents is a new low for American police and a stain on the shield. I am grateful for police in my community and laud their hard work and risks they take. It denigrates the profession to carry on this way. Some officer should take a strong stand against being a hit team for politicians, which, doubtless will probably be coming up more often. We need officers of conscience to stand up and speak out against this practice.\n\nedit: added "(and non-whites)", corrected typo per below with thanks '
"Ginther is a piece of shit. He straight up took kickbacks from a traffic camera company to put their cameras up in Columbus while he was on the city council. \n\nBut he still won the election for mayor a few years later because the local Democratic party endorsed him and people don't pay attention to local politics. After winning he convinced a retired cop to run against Zach Scott, the Franklin County sheriff who had the audacity of challenging Ginther for the party nomination for mayor. \n\nZach Scott is no longer sheriff basically because Ginther is a vengeful prick. "

'You had the perfect opportunity to say "fascholes"'
'The police are mostly good people. They do a lot more good than harm. It would be interesting to see whether any furhther investigations might be spurred by this discovery. Nothing has been proven yet, btw. However, it seems clear that the political atmosphere seems to introduce a risk of using police for resolution of political conflcits. If there is any wrongdoing here, one hopes there will be accountability.\n\nEdit:misspelling/typo'
'I agree. People get into law enforcement for a variety of reasons. At least where I live, most of the police are lovely people who deal with the dregs of society all day, take huge amounts of verbal abuse, and still act with compassion where compassion is needed.\n\nSome people get into law enforcement because they want to have power over other people. I feel like the easiest thing to do is weed these people out as soon as possible and then either ban them from working in law enforcement, or, at the very least, give them a desk job where they will be supervised rather than a badge and a gun.\n'
'Good luck with that.'
'People, get off your asses and on your twitter. Post the truth to his twitter post. If you care about the truth being out and you want to see this admin realize that they don’t control the narrative, then go to his twitter and any twitters trying to spin this like Meadows is and reply with the truth. I don’t really care if you spam it, just show him the truth. '
'The problem is the truth doesn’t matter anymore; it’s about competing narratives. Trump will continue to lie and offer an alternate version of reality to appease his base. That’s really all that matters to him now- keeping his base on his side, and if you look at the polls, he has been very successful even after Helsinki he still has 70% approval among Republicans. Trump will continue to undermine the truth and our democracy to keep himself in power including firing Mueller, installing a sympathetic Justice who will side with him when he postpones the 2020 election. Trump only cares about himself; he has no moral character or sense of duty towards his country. It will take a massive populist movement to oust him; similar to what happens on dictatorships. '
"So it comes down to this:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTrump is absolutely, literally, without a doubt, a complete idiot who is so narcissistic and greedy and corrupt and oblivious that he hasn't got a clue that he was suddenly hoisted to the presidency fraudulently by russian spy ring, and doesn't care because he truly believes it's an honest win and he's a legitimate president, and putin's got his back - he's a good old dude...\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOR\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe's a corrupt, narcissistic piece of shit who has been dirty dealing with russians for decades, to whom he owes his true allegiances...and was groomed by putin to be a plant / agent / spy for the sole purpose of pulling a fucking coup in the government of the usa...\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd yet people think this is an issue best handled by....voting????\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHope you'll remember that when you wake up on your knees in a camp somewhere."

" But, to be fair, they've made it awfully easy for him. \n\nHe probably only has 2 employees working for him, and mostly they just spend their days on twitter. "
'Wow. It costs like $600 grand every time he goes.'
'I believe this is more of a case of ‘here’s x dollars for discretionary purposes’ but if you spend them y, except in cases of z, you need special approval.  Pruitt thinks z applies.  Democrats on the oversight committee say z clearly does not apply.\n\nSo it’s not really a belligerent refusal to follow the rules like your example pretends.  But whatever, I still dislike Pruitt for his policies so this is not something i really want to debate.  I just prefer it, if you’re going to attack someone, to compare it to legitimate wrongdoing and not gross waste like having the secret service secure 2 personal homes and make 100% of your personal outings to property you profit from.  This is the comparison GP was making, and while a great example of waste, it’s still not illegal on the face of it.'

"I am a lawyer. That's largely correct, though there are broadly two types of subpoenas: those for documents and those for testimony. This appears to be for documents.\n\nI don't have anything to do with criminal law, so I don't 100% stand by the following, but if the process is anything like civil litigation, you generally subpoena documents first. If the documents further support your case, you then subpoena testimony where you ask questions, which are at least partially based on what you learned in the documents. These are broad assumptions because you don't need to subpoena the opposing party in civil litigation (they're required to comply with requests for production of documents without needing a subpoena). That said, the processes and strategies should be fairly similar; the terminology and standards are what tend to vary."
'Mueller is basically daring him to fire him. Will just be another obstruction charge. Also, probably has assurances from the Senate that if Trump fires him they will protect him. '

'No one can do what you speak of. Your slightly misinformed on what a pardon can and can’t do. \n\nA presidential pardon doesn’t drop criminal charges because criminal charges imply the person has only been charged not convicted. Being charged is when the police suspect you of a crime but haven’t had a court find you guilty. The president can only pardon someone once they are convicted. Usually the process is for the individual to apply to be pardoned then several people weigh in on it and give recommendations to the president and he makes the final say. Their are downsides to presidential pardons such as the person has to admit guilt to the crime. [source 1](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/politics/presidents-pardon-power-works) \n\n\nOther countries do allow pardons such as Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Iran, and many more I don’t feel like naming [Source 2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon) \n\n\nBack to the US. For state crimes the ability to pardon typically falls to the governors office. Sometimes the governor has sole discretion and sometimes there is a small board that needs to agree with the governor first. \n\n\nAs far as if it’s right or not. The idea behind the presidential pardon stems from the founding fathers themselves. It is used as another form of checks and balances. It helps wipe mistakes made by the judicial system and by prior presidents. Or as one founding father put it a way to heal the nation. Imagine Lincoln pardoning thousands of confederate soldiers to bring peace to the nation. Most presidents don’t abuse the pardon system because of the sanctity of the office they serve.

'Yes but Kurt Russell played Wyatt Earp in Tombstone.. Know your Western history bud'
'**Pardon**\n\nA pardon is a government decision to allow a person who has been convicted of a crime to be free and absolved of that conviction, as if they were never convicted.\n\nToday, pardons are granted in many countries when individuals have demonstrated that they have paid their debt to society, or are otherwise considered to be deserving of them. Pardons are sometimes offered to persons who were either wrongfully convicted or who claim that they were wrongfully convicted. In some jurisdictions, accepting a pardon implicitly constitutes an admission of guilt (see Burdick v.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

The only thing you can do to a president is remove him by voting, which is our job, or impeachment in the house and a trial in the senate, both of which are R controlled. If he wants any success, he has to have a rock solid case far beyond any reasonable or even unreasonable doubt to convince 30 Rs to vote against there own party.

"I don't understand.

'Don\'t want to validate such nonsense- but what the hell: To this point every thread of the "its a librul plot!" line has gone nowhere. I await the June 14th Inspector\'s General report and if anyone acted improperly I expect them to be dealt with accordingly. Its already a matter of public record that the origins of the investigation were grounded in legitimate concerns; but yes- anyone abusing their position should be punished.\nNow..if I may ask you a question. If a former Marine, purple heart recipient, lifelong public servant, former FBI director with strong bipartisan recognition as a man of integrity and fealty to the law finds that Trump knowingly and willingly broke multiple laws- several against the interests of the United States - would you accept it and, in defense and loyalty to your country - would you want to see him punished on accordance with the law? Serious question.'

Fivethirtyeight had it at [71%](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/), which honestly is pretty good given the information available at the time, and the fact that election models aren\'t magic.

'> if Kennedy son has a lent a ton of money to trump wouldn’t that mean, trump is under his control not that he is under trump control\n\nThat would be true if that’s all there was to the case, but it isn’t. First off, the debt is owed to Deutsche Bank, not Kennedy’s son directly, so he has no leverage over the President now that the loan has gone through. Second... it’s obvious from Trump’s credit history that no sane or reasonable person should be lending him change for a cab, much less a billion fucking dollars. On top of that, it’s all but certain now that he’s been laundering money for the Russian mob, and possibly other criminal organizations, for decades. So the fact that he got a massive loan from Deutsche Bank thanks to Kennedy’s son means that either a) he’s someone Kennedy’s son likes enough to make a billion-dollar gamble on despite being a walking red flag, in which case he’s way too close to the family for Kennedy to be voting on cases concerning him, or b) the Kennedys, and possibly other higher-ups at Deutsche Bank, are compromised by the mob, the KGB, or someone else who has a strong (and almost certainly illegal) interest in Trump continuing to get loans and do business. \n\nI’m not normally a conspiracy-minded person... but I do find myself wondering if Kennedy was already compromised in 2010 when he opened the floodgates for untraceable spending on political campaigns with Citizens United. After all, he’s supposed to be reasonable, and yet he cast the deciding vote for a ruling that killed the last barrier to corporations and anonymous mega-donors outright buying elections...'

More than 1000 paid bloggers and commenters reportedly worked only in a single building of the Agency in 2015.\n\nThe extent to which the Russian government tried to influence public opinion using social media became widely known after a June 2014 BuzzFeed article greatly expanded on government documents published by hackers earlier that year.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28"
"It's easy to live in a bubble. I encounter just about zero vocal Trump supporters in my day-to-day life because I spend 99% of my time in the Baltimore/DC Metro area. If I were to go an hour west, I'd find a good mix between liberals and moderate conservatives (those that voted for Trump because tax cuts and Obamacare repeal exclusively). Another hour and you'd have an easier time finding someone with at least three Trump stickers on their truck than someone who has ever even thought about voting democrat in 50 years."

'Wow this place is going to be fun once you guys realize who/what Mueller is investigating. '
"Allegations are laid out, plain as day. The evidence to support them unfortunately isn't. The simple fact is that much of the actual evidence is tied up due to the nature of the ongoing investigatory process. Much has been speculated and suggested, few things have been substantiated or supported with evidence. A prime example of this is the Manafort case. The more you learn about the Manfort case, the more I think you will agree with me. \n\nI would agree that this isn't a matter of left vs right. Corruption has no party or national allegiance. You allege with such veracity that you must be absolutely certain, and yet Mueller's special counsel investigation has spent many more millions of dollars than you to reach a conclusion that disagrees with yours. As I've said, there is certainly still time and opportunity for me to be wrong, but in this particular context it seems strange that nothing actionable has resulted from Mueller's investigation in regards to Trump supposedly being controlled by a hostile nation. I know it's an easy trap to fall into, but it just doesn't make sense why something of that much importance wouldn't be the first thing flushed out by Mueller's investigation. \n\n\n> Mueller isn’t a “anti-Trump hero”. He’s a lawman doing his job to protect the US from threats.\n\n100%\n\n"

'Sure,  but basically, they need 60 votes, which means all the Republicans and 9 Democrats (or more Democrats if they don\'t get all the Republicans).\n\nThis means they have to offer the Democrats *something*. They only need the nine most conservative Democrats... the senators from say Alabama, West Virginia, North Dakota, Missour, and a few more... but they have to offer *something", maybe not a lot, but something. At this point they don\'t seem to be doing so.\n\nThat\'s is an effect of the supermajority requirement. This requirement works the same when the parties are reversed and is supported and maintained by both parties, so it\'s not a partisan thing.\n\nTrump, to his credit, seemed quite open to some sort of compromise. But he seems to have to changed his mind, and the Republican party is not at this time offering any reasonable comprise.\n\nJust to be frank and honest and not intended as an attack, but as a practical matter, it\'s not clear at this point what Trump wants, what he believes, or if he really understands the subject very well. If he does, he needs to communicate this much better. Absent that, negotiations are quite difficult.'

'What "everything" did they offer? They didn\'t offer a DACA solution (i mean Trump offered it but it was then withdrawn). They did offer CHIP funding, but that\'s not really anything, considering that both parties agree that CHIP is a good thing. That\'s kind of like "Well, as a concession to you Democrats, if you agree to this bill, we won\'t give Washington State to Canada, as a concession on our part, OK?"'
">They offered the democrats everything. Obstruction is the name of the game. The republicans did this with Obama\n\nActually the Republicans didn't offer Obama anything. McConnell swore that Obama would not be able to accomplish anything, and all of the executive orders Obama issued so he could accomplish something. All the do-nothing Republican congresses did was vote to repeal the ACA over 60 times."
'they consistently vote to keep the powerful powerful and to keep the rich rich. This isnt due to any set of principles or ideals, but simply because they are the rich and powerful due to the way the government operates'
'Their overlords (not the people who keep on voting for them) direct them as they see fit. And they are happy to lockstep with their masters.'
'I don\'t, actually. I just explained above. I\'ll try to explain it more simply. Both of these "concessions" are basically identical:\n\n* "As a concession to you Democrats, we will extend CHIP for six years".\n\n* "As a concession to you Democrats, we will not give Washington State to Canada, at least not in the next six years."\n\nSee what I\'m saying? Neither of these are "concessions" since both sides agree on whether they\'re a good thing. The Republican Party likes CHIP, thinks CHIP is a good thing, and intends to extend CHIP. So how is it a "concession" to support CHIP? It\'s just nonsense to say that it is.\n\nWho is the "they" that doesn\'t have a DACA solution? DACA was fine: Delayed Action for Childhood Arrivals. It worked fine under Obama. That\'s the solution the Democrats have on offer: keep doing that.\n\nI get that the Republican Party doesn\'t *want* to continue DACA. So what? You need sixty votes. You have to do *something* you don\'t want in order to get the Wall funding and so forth that you do want, and get a budget passed.\n\nUpdate, looks like the Republicans were successful in getting the Americans to blame the Democrats more for the shutdown, so the Democrats caved. That\'s politics, and doesn\'t prove that the Democrats really *were* responsible. We\'re going to have to revisit this shortly, though... so we\'ll see.'

"I am not a Republican, I don't care what they did during the Obama presidency, and I voted for him. You must not live in a state affected by illegals, or you must not know anybody who has immigrated here legally and has been negatively affected by the illegals. They are practically treated like slaves over here in good ole California.\n\nYou just assume I'm a white christian too lol, and you just assume DACA is 'incredibly popular' despite Obama deferring it to the next president. I'm with Trump and the republicans on this one though, No wall, no DACA. We need to control our borders once and for all."
"I sure did, but the fact you just **know** I didn't tells me just about everything I need to know about you. You lack wisdom. I will not reply to you anymore because if I am to try to debate people on here with a 10 minute rate limit, I might as well not try to debate people that think they know everything. "

'Here\'s the original video of Trump saying "Russia if you\'re listening" -- along with followup questions from reporters -- it\'s 100% clear Trump wasn\'t joking:\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/video/watch-trump-call-on-russia-to-find-clinton-s-emails-tell-reporter-to-be-quiet-733375555707\n\nOne of the most interesting details of the Cohen development -- other than TRUMP FUCKING KNEW (which really has been obvious all along) -- is that this leak appears to NOT have come from Cohen or his team.\n\nIf it came from Trump\'s team, he must be pretty damn desperate.'
'>"I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week, and we\'re going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons," Trump said during a speech after winning the California, Montana, New Mexico, South Dakota and New Jersey primaries.

Who knows?" \n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2017/07/11/politics/trump-campaign-june-9/index.html\n\nThe speech, of course, never took place. And it\'s extremely clear that Trump said the above expecting to get dirt from the Trump Tower meeting, and then never gave the speech because the Russians didn\'t give him any dirt on Hillary.'

"I still don't think of Trump as anything other than a b-list celebrity. Which he would consider the greatest insult."
'So popularity = the truth or right thing. That is fucking hilarious. '
"How the fuck are people still trusting anything on cable?  Fox is nazi-level propaganda, but MSBCs trying to match it and even the centrist networks are 90% entertainment.  PSA: don't get your history, science, news, dating-advice, career-advice, or any other information relevant to important decisions in you life from cable television.  Please.  For all our sake.  America needs an intervention."
"> Fifty-nine percent of respondents said they believe Mueller is conducting a fair investigation, while 26 percent said it was not fair.\n\nAll that this survey proves is that that 15% of the people taking the survey were smart enough to admit that they don't know enough about the subject to comment on it. "
"The rule of law would require the president to make some time available as nobody is above the law in a democracy. This isn't the Cuban missile crisis, Trump isn't in the situation room 20 hours per day. Presidents make time for photo ops, speeches to boy scouts, presentation of awards and honours, and golf - these are all much lower priorities than an investigation of this nature. The Russian election meddling is the greatest attack on the mainland by a state actor since WW2, the investigation must proceed and an innocent president should want to ensure its success."
"We don't have the facts on Trump's involvement but with four people indicted so far the question of collusion will go before the courts in accordance with principles of natural justice. If others are indicted in future, same deal. That's how criminality is determined in a justice system based on the rule of law and it should not be impeded."
'This reminded me of old Colbert. This was pretty funny'
"Colbert is the man. He was brutally honest toward Hillary too, and he is a Bernie Bro (even though his corporate CBS sponsors restrained him from being too vocal about it). I've been a fan of his since his appearances on the Dana Carvey Show and Strangers With Candy. Thank God for his comic relief in these Dark Ages of American history."
'Hahaha I loved it! I haven’t laughed this good since [REDACTED].'
'From the book America According to Colbert - Satire as Public Pedagogy (by S. McClennan)\n\nColbert: Peter Cook was once asked if he thought that satire had a political effect.  He said, “Absolutely. The greatest satire of the twentieth century was the Weimar Cabaret, and they stopped Hitler in his tracks!” It doesn’t mean what we do is worthless. It’s hard to do, and people like it, and it’s great. But it doesn’t mean that it has an effect politically.\n\nStewart: Or that it has an agenda of social change. We are not warriors in anyone’s army.... I don’t view us as people who lead social movements. '
'Well, he seems to be snapping back into character for these interviews which is great and gives you a little slice of nostalgia. '
"My friend is a staffer on the hill. She moved to DC to answer the phone at her congressman's office and it is a thankless job for an unpaid intern. She pours her soul into trying to explain things to constituents and understand their concerns and several calls have left her in tears. \n\nWhen Colbert filmed this a couple of weeks ago he spent the whole day there goofing off and cracking everyone up. He took extra time to talk with staffers and let them get pictures, thanking each of them for their work. She said that day alone made the whole internship worthwhile.\n\nHe is genuinely a nice guy who cares about his country. "
"I feel like the streaming didn't hit the the comedy punch it deserved"
'You don’t watch the Opposition with Jordan Klepper? When John left I thought Jordan would have been a perfect fit as the host of the DS. But it turns how he found an even better niche basically on an evolved version of the Colbert Report. He and his staff do a lot of these off-the-wall interviews. '
'Never saw it but now excited to watch it.  Thank you kind stranger.'
"It does but it doesn't mean we can't opine for the good old days.  I'm honestly surprised by how much downvotes my post got simply saying I miss 2 shows."
'I have and do watch the shows. I like them all.  I enjoy new takes on things and appreciate what each has to offer. \n\nColbert is alway silly. That never changed.  Him and John Oliver uncomfortably close in a box was hysterical!  \n\nI like Trevor Noah. Seeing a "new" American take on our culture gives me new insight. \n\nI just don\'t see it the way you do,  I guess.'
'Essentially: The Daily Show was better with Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert was better on the Colbert Report.'
'So, women who are "cunts," as you deem them, deserve to be imprisoned? Glad to see a republican finally admit they want to burn the U.S. constitution and turn America into a dictatorship, like North Korea. Thanks for confirming what we already suspected!'
"Cool man, if trumps not guilty, you have nothing to worry about. We'll wait and see what happens."
'I respect that you truly believe this in your heart, however misguided it may be. '
"Haha good one, can't criticize them since they're not the president. Got me."
'Russian collusion is the ultimate conspiracy theory. Pushed by criminals in an attempt to cover their crimes, and overthrow lawful government.\n\nDo you have one shred of evidence ?\n\nWhat about the meeting with the Russian lawyer given special clearance by Loretta Lynch to enter the country to meet with Don jr. ? Did she lie about having the goods on HRC ? Yes. Did she meet with Fusion GPS henchman Glenn Simpson both before and after the meeting ? Yes. Was it an attempt to "set up" Trump ? Yes. Why do you need to try and set people up ? **Because they aren\'t guilty**. Did they illegally spy on the campaign and President of the United States ? Yes.\n\nThere is hard, cold, irrefutable and verifiable evidence to support all this. The real truth is coming out, and you are mad about it. What kind of person does that make you ? What kind of citizen does that make you ? You are the deplorable, running around shout false allegations at others. Pathetic.'
'Well Trump\'s two most recent quotes are:\n\n"I believe Robert Mueller will treat me fairly" (and he will)\n\nAnd\n\n"There was no collusion, but even if there was collusion it\'s not a crime (hahaha yeah, it is), but there was no collusion"(hahah... Hah... Convincing, don... Convincing.)\n\nSo... We\'ll see.'

"You're the one advocating for corruption-lite in politics. You are a toxic person. You have a laughable combo of under informed and over agressive. New year, new you! Hope you end this year in a better mental state than you started it! "

"Oops....sorry.   Due to the rule changes, conservatives cannot go to the courts, but have to go through arbitration now.\n\n/s\n\nGo ahead and challenge the investigation based on a completely unsubstantiated conspiracy theory.   It'll be fun to watch a court of law laugh in your fat faces."
"We all need to prepare for the worst and hope for the best at this point. Y'all-Queda is gonna come out of the woodwork and this very well may lead us down a path no one wants, but it's certainly more and more likely daily. "

I know several people IRL that read it, especially at work (I work at an engineering firm in the midwest - the workforce is highly Republican). I see their memes and other things ALL over Facebook.

'Good thing groups like the NRA don’t have to report donor information to the IRS anymore. The GOP needs all the foreign money it can get. '
'When all is said and done, I believe the republican Party will return to some sense of honesty and relevancy. In the years since the days of *Citizens United* ruling which essentially gave carte blanc to special interests to corrupt politicians in a legal way, no party has taken advantage of its dark underbelly parts as much as the GOP and its supporters., it\'s fruitful gift it was given is now beginning to rot and fester as we see how true masters of corruption, the people behind Putin, Oligarchs and Russian intelligence, can use these tools to really reek havoc on American politics.\n\nThe Republican party clings to Trump like a symbiotic host at the least and at the worst, antagonistic or parasitic. Trump has used what parts of the GOP he wants and discards the rest. \n\nIts clear that the GOP has become co-dependent on Trump, a love and abuse relationship that the GOP cannot seem to handle or have not a clue on how to end it. They sold their base to Trump & Co. when they allowed the White Supremacists and rabid "no-nothing" anti-immigrant "deplorable" to take over. They gave Donald Trump the loudest "dog-whistle" and taught him how to use it.\n\nThe GOP needs help and if has to be tough love. But between the , the Freedom Caucus, Tea Partyers and other groups sworn to fringe beliefs and politics, they will, in killing a parasite like Trump, have to take a little poison, and may kill of the Donald, but also the fringe politics that have brought some fringe voters out with their needed support of a GOP that is getting old and tired.'
">Yes.  The founding fathers seriously didn't plan for this.  I have no idea how this can resolve itself when the majority commit treason.\n\nSoap box --> ballot box --> jury box --> ammo box. We're in step one, with step two in sight. Trust in the system. It's what makes us great."

'Here in Arizona, while the GOP has shrunk, or had a very low or negative growth rate, the Independents have grown and are now the largest segment of the voters, as all three are around 32-33%, so its pretty equal. While the independents are not republican, they are social and fiscal conservatives and tend to vote that way. They can be swayed though, but only with much re-assurance and hand holding. Do not be fooled by Trumps recent rallies here, he is not real welcome and only the most conservative Republican bastions of North and SE Phoenix support him (and Sheriff Joe) The people are not happy here as you can tell by both Jeff Flake and Sen McCain, who most hold here, either Republican, Independents and even some Democrats, with a bit of reverence,or at least respect\n\nI think the Dems here will gain some seats (1-3) in the House, but if they win a seat in the Senate, the republican party here will drop its support of trumpettts like a hot tamale cooking on the streets of Phoenix mid-day. The Independents will decide this election.'

"A brief case against this subreddit, intended with the greatest of respect to all parties involved:\n\nBob Muller is an honorable man whose job is to seek the truth of the matter concerning our President.  He was chosen because he would be seen as competent figure with broad, bipartisan support. Initially, he was clearly seen as such.  This is important, as to maintain some semblance of unity going forward from whatever discoveries he may make, he needs to be trusted by all sides.  Various parties have been trying to undermine this by painting the situation as Trump vs. Muller. While I do not think this subreddit was created with the intention of pushing this narrative, I'm afraid that it does play into it.  Muller should be viewed first and foremost as someone seeking the truth.  If he is viewed as Trump's rival by the general public, Trump can try to paint the investigation as unfair, a witch hunt, etcetera, and some portion of the public will eat it up.  Because this subreddit would play into a narrative that would delegitimization Mueller's investigation, I cannot support it."
'Let\'s see... \n\nSince this is a parody of the The_Donald [but  nonetheless on the side of the good guys], we need some title for Mueller, and of course we need to one-up the Trump supporters as parody of them... \n\nSo if Trump is "God-Emperor" to the Trump supporters, what should Mueller be?

"I consider this to be the most convincing detail:\n\n>The official story is that Davidson reached out to Cohen, who then contacted Broidy.\xa0Why in the world would Davidson tell Cohen about an illicit affair involving Broidy?\xa0Cohen was Trump’s lawyer, not Broidy’s.\xa0Cohen didn’t represent Broidy at that time and therefore had no duty of confidentiality or loyalty to Broidy (or Bechard for that matter).\xa0And the information that Broidy had an affair with Bechard was extremely sensitive, as Bechard was set to make seven figures for agreeing to keep that information private.\n\n>Spilling the beans to Cohen, who would then have been free to tell anyone else what Davidson had told him, would risk Bechard’s payoff in two ways.\xa0If Cohen failed to keep Broidy and Bechard’s affair confidential, the settlement value to Broidy of a potential nondisclosure agreement could have been greatly diminished or even completely destroyed.\xa0Also, Cohen merely knowing about Broidy’s supposed affair could have jeopardized both Broidy’s position as co-chair of the Republican National Committee’s finance committee — a position he actually shared with, of all people, Cohen — and his elaborate and ongoing influence-peddling with the government.\xa0(Someone who has had conversations with Davidson about this matter says that, according to Davidson, Broidy did not even know Cohen before he contacted him about Bechard.)\n\nAlso is anybody asking how Davidson happens to be the lawyer representing the women in all three incidents? Keep in mind all three dumped him after coming to the conclusion he had Trump's priorites in mind above theirs.\n"

Then when Trump found out about the abortion, he cried in despair, because he believes every life is sacred.  And of course, it’s all Hillary’s fault.  Lock her up, lock her up.  '

"542 million users\n\n234 unique users per month\n\n#4 most visited site, USA\n\n#8 most visited site in the world\n\nTheoretical TCP max packet size, 64K\n\nAverage percentage of malicious traffic 25%\n\nBased upon this data, and some of it is there as a general use pattern, we see what traffict Reddit could receive. This rough guide uses 64k to cover various data sizes and types as inbound traffic. That gives us 15 Terabytes of TCP traffic per month, on a very conservative average. We then have all the annoying script kiddies, botnets, angry governments, etc., that send malicious packets. That increases the monthly traffic by about 3.75 Terabytes per month. \n\nNow those packets have to talk with DNS, firewalls, load balancers, servers, object storage, backend adminstration services, and back to the users. That requires a significant amount of infrastructure to support all that traffic. This infrastructure includes several routers, switches and other network gear.\n\nWe have an average visitation time of 13 minutes and 8 billion page visits per month. That brings up our monthly package transmissions significantly. I'd SWAG the monthly inbound packets to be over 50 Terabytes and outbound to be close.\n\nWhere do we store all of that data? There will be databases, object storage and general filesystems storing that data. That's a lot of data! This accumulation is impressive, most companies love to retain data for data mining, think data scientists. There's also log data to use for trouble shooting and seeking out those malicious folks.\n\nReddit, yet another super SWAG, probably stores 250 Terabytes per month.\n\nThey also have developers, administrative staff, etc. that are required to run the business. \n\nAs I have worked with global scale organizations with millions of users,, even very lean ones such as Reddit, the monthly overheard for technologies are most likely over $750,000.00 per month. There's a solid chance of it being higher. The costs for the employees are probably over $2,500,000.00 per month, based upon some posts on Glassdoor.\n\nThis is a rough estimate of costs. Reddit has some ads revenue, but no where near Facebook or Google. Reddit gold does help pay the bills. It's highly doubtful they are making tons of money from such a small and unique feature. \n\nThe challenge Reddit has is monetization of their product without becoming an ad smeared service like Facebook. It's quite a challenge really, to make money while offering a service that is free to its customer's.\n\n\n"

'The Republican Party won\'t do anything because it considers party, power, and control exponentially more important than democratic institutions, alliances, or citizens. With such a display of insanity being bombarded at us daily, by every side of the media, certain elements of the GOP are able to undercut any attempts at change and continue to push their agenda quietly through legislative channels. While the media and elements within their own party increasingly cast doubts on this presidency and the actions it takes, supporters broadcast their own narrative to bolster their base and rely on constant and increasingly insane media coverage to distract their opposition from pressing issues.\n\nFor example, on "liberal" issues:\n\nRemember Bump Stocks? Non issue. The media moved on to another crazy political story.\n\nRemember school shootings? Something else happened and moved the discussion.\n\nNet Neutrality? In the past now and largely forgotten.\n\nSinclair going Goebbels? Nope. One time coverage before a new shit show distracted everyone.\n\nFlorida gerrymandering and secret GOP map redistricting efforts? Forgotten.\n\nTaxes? Infrastructure? Military Spending? CBP or NPR being defunded? The dismantling of AmeriCorps? Supreme Court Cases? All the "distant past."\n\nMeanwhile:\n\nFox News - Cover Story as of 0948 EST is Rand Paul saying it\'s ok to Reach out to Russia.\n\nWell, that seems reasonable. America has often reached out to former enemies. This changes the narrative and distracts the GOP base from the larger issue-the President of the United States pretty much shaming and insulting the entire US intelligence community. Under normal circumstances, it\'s perfectly acceptable to offer an olive branch. These are not normal circumstances, but the title and article aim to distract and change the narrative to prevent faith in the President from being lost.

'The 19.5% was bought by Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), Glencore, and QHG Cayman LTD, all incorporated in a consortium called QHG Holdings, LLC, formed a few days before the sale. The random inclusion of a Cayman Islands company has raised flags from the get go. The .5% brokerage fee theory is just that - a theory. An Italian bank and other financial orgs lent billions to QHG for the purchase price. QIA only offered up about $2 billion for the $10 billion stake. Glencore offered far less than that. The Italian bank offered a $5.2 billion loan, meaning QIA and Glencore didn’t really expend much capital in the purchase. However, all the parties to the purchase - including the Cayman Islands company - still reaped the benefits when they sold the stake to China last year. The $282 million *might* be all that transferred hands to Trump/associates, and the theory that is was tacked on as a brokerage fee could be right. But that’s not necessarily fact yet either. '

My reasoning: \n\nhttps://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/02/trump-russia-indictment-mueller-probe-384969 So basically lawyers who have dealt with muellers team think that based upon, I assume, line of questioning that trump is guilty as fuck and they have proof. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/thehill.com/homenews/media/374178-abcs-stephanopoulos-to-interview-comey-in-april%3famp (correct me if I am wrong but I believe I read somewhere that nothing is off the table for that interview in regards to what George is allowed to ask) While I realize that it is simply an interview about his book he does seem to also be advertising the interview and his public statements about trump/Hillary/everything he knew as FBI director leading up to the election. To me I feel like he would not be allowed to talk openly about much of this for legal reasons/ out of respect for letting the special counsel simply do their job. That being said he may simply say "I cannot answer that at this point in time" which I truly hope is not the case. \n\nI mean we are months behind knowing what the special counsel has been doing for most things we find out about. And the stuff we are getting now is so absolutely juicy and delicious I could see trump being named within a month and a half \n\nEdit: Mueller is just crossing his Ts and dotting his Is :)'
"Yeah, I agree.  Honestly, I don't think he'd even be allowed to release the book if Mueller didn't have his ducks all lined up.  \n\nAnd I see Trump being indicted by the end of March too.  And I've been saying that since the very first indictments of Manafort and Gates.  My reasoning comes from managing a  whole lot of complex litigation during the 1980s& 1990s, where I came to love the RICO act and the art of legally lasso-ing criminals as if they were rodeo calves.  I think I've got some sort of sense of the rate and rhythm at which these things proceed.\n\nBasically I started with the number of attorneys working under Mueller, and factored in their incredible expertise,  intelligence and intense professionalism.  Then I added into that Mueller's own abilities.  Then what they must have on Manafort and Gates to get to the stage of a GJ indictment, and then from there I walked my way, indictment by indictment to Trump.  And it was around the end of March.  And that's before I even factored in George Papadopoulos.\n\nNext up, imo?  Brad Parscale.  And pretty soon, Peter Pansky aka Kushner.  But not quite yet.  \n\nBuckle up kids!  March is going to be some kind of wild ride."

Or should even the act of investigating be held off on til after they’ve left office, where evidence is missing, gone or cold, memories are foggy, and even statutes of limitations have run their course?\n\nIs this guy actually saying that investigations of sitting presidents shouldn’t take place? \n\nWouldn’t John Gotti have loved it if he had gotten to choose his entire jury and which judge should preside over his case?\n\nIf anything, because of the extreme amount of trust and power given to the office, anyone occupying it should be held more accountable to the law than the average citizen, not less. '
'He says he believes that impeachment is a solution for removing a President from office, not indictment or prosecution, but he also believes that the President should be immune from investigation. If the President cannot even be investigated, how can we come to point where we are sure that he/she should be impeached? It seems like a contradiction.'
'Provide the source, this looks like it’s from a law review journal. \n\nGive us the source, and everyone should send this excerpt to their senate representatives and say you want them to push for this question to be asked at the confirmation hearing. We want to know for a fact, under oath, that he doesn’t hold this belief or will not act on it, or that he will, either way. \n\nThis is legal strategy, because if he says no, and pushes for this idea later, he would’ve effectively lied in his confirmation hearing, and if he says yes, this is a piece Mueller can use as circumstantial evidence for Trumps obstruction of justice charge. '
"Okay, I'm more interested who found Kavanaugh to be nominated. It's not like Trump would go through all potential Supreme Court candidates to weed out this piece of info.\n\nAnd what a coincidence that Kennedy is retiring for this guys name to come up so fast."
'I do find it amusing that he wrote that essentially defending Clinton. Saying that investigation distracted him from running the country. \n\nAnd some are taking it as him being a trump supporter/defender.  That’s not really the case at all. \n\nClinton’s investigation was essentially completely irrelevant to him being president or his job as president until he lied under oath.   Trump on the other hand, potentially working with a foreign country to win an election and perhaps still working with them is a completely different sort of issue that directly effects his ability as president. \n\nI don’t see anyway Kavanaugh would suggest stopping the mueller probe at this point. As trump is still not even labeled as a/the subject of the probe. \n\nI mean I understand people are going to flip out because trump nominated Kavanaugh. But tbh kavanuagh is a moderate, he’s in all likelihood the best possible nomination we would get from trump. '
'I hope he thinks that way.  We need someone with the countrys best interest in mind.  We don\'t need a "stacked court" that trump\'s case might be decided by.\n'
'You mean he did his job to the best of his abilities when working on the Starr report? Oh the horror. We should much prefer a person who half asses his job. Your argument here is the equivalent of you wanting Mueller to not do his job if Trump was a Democrat.  I on the other hand want all investigations handled as thoroughly and professionally as possible.  And I agree with Kavanaugh that if the investigation is largely irrelevant into how the president is actually governing the country, that the investigation should take place after his presidency. \n\nHe specifically mentions Clinton in his article and how the investigation into Clinton distracted Clinton from being able to run the country.  How you see that but anything as supportive of Clinton I do not know. \n\n\n\n'
"That is the traditional understanding of executive immunity. A special prosecutor would typically refer his findings to Congress and recommend impeachment. Mueller indicting Trump would be *Mueller* breaking the norm.\n\nOf course, I don't think the drafters of the Constitution envisioned a complicit Congress that would never impeach, which takes the bite away from impeachment, to say the least."
"Doing his job is not equivalent to pursuing an aggressive approach in an investigation. Those who use less aggressive methods on reasonable grounds may just as well be fulfilling their role. Kavanaugh's problem is that his own words can be utilized to criticize his actions, and it is difficult to say he was completely free from political bias while forming that opinion.\n\nIf the American Supreme Court rulings weren't so partisan themselves, what you said would be reasonable: both parties should not use Supreme Court nominees for their political gain. Unfortunately that is not the case, as their rulings on many contentious issues such as same sex marriage, pollution, race and redistrcting, Citizens United, ACA, and Bush v. Gore were decided by 5-4 votes along the party lines. I should also remind you that many conservatives who disliked Trump held their nose and voted for him particularly because he would fill the judicial positions with conservatives. As some of his most unqualified judicial nominees have been confirmed because of his conservative credentials, it makes little sense for Democrats to let Republicans do whatever they want with the courts. GOP's judiciary and Supreme Court takeover will have a powerful effect on the society for the next decades, on everything from the environment and healthcare to civil rights and corporate finance. This will be the biggest damage Trump has done."
'It is though. You take whatever (legal or ethical) approach you can to accomplish the goal.  Which he did. Personal opinion can’t stop you from doing your job. That’s exactly a qualification you want for a Supreme Court Justice \n\nIf you look at how Kavanaugh has ruled, he has ruled against his party on big topics many times. He is not a party follower with his rulings. '
"His opinions have been similar to where his party stands regarding key issues such as environment and national surveillance. On the issue of abortion and ACA, though he did not give what some right-wingers had hoped, he still leans conservative. There is uncertainty as to what he will do to them as Supreme Court justice, but his opinions won't be any savior to liberals. Some hardline conservatives indeed opposed his nomination because of their own purity test, yet it does not mean Republicans oppose him as a whole, as other conservative groups have pushed Kavanaugh's nomination. His opinions will definitely not be free from his own conservative agenda (just as none of the Supreme Court justices have been), and they will be more favorable to GOP than Roberts and Kennedy's have been."

"Just because bush wasn't impeached doesn't mean people all of a sudden like him. Just look at oj just because he won his trial doesn't mean his life turned out well. Especially since he kept committing crimes like I'm sure trump will."
"You must live in a very insulated world if you think all Trump supporters are hillbillies or all hillbillies are bad people.\n\nThe worst Trump supporters are by far the rich well educated conservatives who are taking advantage of poor governance to capture regulatory bodies and amass greater wealth. Just as bad are the racists. But there are plenty of Trump supporters that don't fall into these categories. Most of what's left are good people.\n\nIf you don't believe me I suggest you go out and meet some people from outside of your political hidey-hole. I'm from a family of conservatives. Many of my relatives are Trump supporters because they've been told to be Trump supporters. These are also the people who have taught me to exercise tolerance, to help others, and to love openly and often.\n\nIf you can't operate under a pretense of empathy, or if you assume 35% of Americans are beneath you, you will never change anyone's mind."
'Exactly. I had a little just after the election because those that thought Trump was going to work for them had been conned. But after everything that has come out post-election I have zero sympathy for any Trump loyalist with their head still in the sand.'
"We need more empathic discussion.\n\nWe need to be the people reaching out and having thoughtful conversations with others. About politics yes, but we need to focus on how the other party in the conversation feels and why they feel the way they do. We need to present facts in a way that guides the other party's emotions in a positive direction. \n\nWe need to start more political conversations in neutral environments, but we need to do so with tolerance and without judgement. Befriend people and discuss their opinions then discuss, in a friendly manner, why you think the way you do.\n\nThis takes a large amount of time and can be very frustrating. Don't engage on days where you aren't up to snuff. People can sense when you're getting frustrated and sometimes you may say things in a way that puts them off further.\n\nAs far as making people more discerning, this is harder than changing people's minds.  Read articles with them, if it's appropriate, then discuss what you thought about it. Keep in mind certain things:\n\nRhetoric vs. Factual argument\n\nOpinion pieces are held to much lower journalistic standards\n\nHistory and motive of author\n\nThe only way we can change people's minds is by genuinely caring about the way that they think. That means that we will have the most success in discussions with people we care about where we force ourselves to be empathetic and patient."
"I would also like to share some thoughts that keep me levelheaded and more personable in political discussions.\n\nI strongly believe that you and I and every other human being are absolutely no different in our core. Under the right genetic and experiential circumstances I believe that anyone could be an Albert Einstein, highly influential with incredible concern for the human condition. Conversely, I also believe that anyone, under the exact wrong conditions, is capable of great atrocity. In this way every other person is a mirror in which we can see ourselves.\n\nThis might be stupid to you or anyone else reading this, but this thought has helped guide me through the most important conversations I've had with other people and I think it will help guide me through a few more.

'I think you\'re confused. The United States didn\'t own these uranium mines. So Russia wouldn\'t be "selling it back to us."

"It's pretty amazing how few leaks we've had since Mueller took over the investigation. Seems most of the leaks are now coming from the Trump administration itself. Mueller is damn good at what he does. I'm looking forward to his full report. "
"Guess we'll find out. I won't pretend to know what Mueller has in mind, but I hope he won't leave us in the dark. "
'You\'re right. Rich guys who have a ton of money are constantly saying, "No. Please don\'t give me any more money. I have enough."'
'He’s only pretending to be rich. Why are you ok with that lie?'
'I actually agree with this with the additional point that the info would help reporters connect the dots a bit quicker. I assume Mueller can get these records anyway.'
'I love when people talk about Trump and polls... reminds of the Clinton 92% & Trump 8% chance of winning, the NYT put out before the election. Please screencap this so I can eat my words.'
"It isn't a poll of Fox News viewers.\n\nIt's a poll of all registered voters, taken by ODC, Opinion Dynamics Corp.\n\nAlmost all News organizations outsource their polls. The firewall between the news organizations and polls was best demonstrated in 2012 when Fox News was condemning polls showing Obama will be favored while failing to mention that their own Fox News/ODC poll was the one that most heavily favored Obama.\n\nThe only poll that's notoriously biased is Rasmussen, which is why you hear Trump quoting it all the time."
"Because we admire the Special Counsel and his team for not leaking information. They are here for justice, not glory, and talking about their case has zero value for them or for us.  \n  \nBy comparison, look at what happened when the Special Counsel team handed over their evidence regarding Michael Cohen to the Manhattan FBI and US Attorney's offices: leaks, leaks, leaks."
"Depends how you look at it.\n\nThere are three types of populations for polls.\n\n**Adults**\n\n**Registered Voters** - a subset of Adults\n\n**Likely Voters** - a subset of Registered Voters\n\nGallup, and a couple others use **Adults**, meaning **All Adults across the US**.\n\nMost Organizations use **Registered Voters**, except when it's polling for a specific election, in which case they'll use **Likely Voters**, a subset of Registered Voters that are deemed Likely vote using the polling organizations desired methodology.\n\nIn the case of Rasmussen, all polls are **Likely Voters**. This is bizarre because even approval rating, a measurement in which most voters aren't even asked if they are likely to vote in any specific election, are somehow selected by Rasmussen using their own flexible methodology.\n\nSo that makes you wonder how Rasmussen selects for **Likely Voters** as a subset within the respondents. Unfortunately, you won't find the full methodology being released. You also won't find the raw data ever being released to any of the official polling organization for review. The fact that they release neither their methodology nor their data is incredibly suspect.\n\nBear in mind, it was once one of the best polling organizations. However, those days are in the past."
'http://fivethirtyeight.com has some very good discussion on this. As u/tlydon007 points out, methodology can skew polling results even when polling organizations like to say they are looking at the same populations. If you want to dig in to the details: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeight-calculates-pollster-ratings/'
'Let\'s give credit to the career professionals at the FBI and the Department of Justice for understanding the historic impact of their work and how important it is to speak with one voice—only when all the facts are known and honest, good-faith conclusions can be drawn.  \n  \nAlso, the team takes after its leader and Mr. Mueller has never been "media friendly."'

"Why would law or truth matter within a legal investigation...? But hey, at least Fox News is reporting on popular opinion... I'm guessing it's an option you share?"
"This is also why I think the FISA court needs reform. As I understand it, the Chief Justice selects FISA court judges, meaning it's been decades since anyone not a Republican has been making the choices. I would prefer to see a rotation of the responsibility to select FISA judges rotated among all SCOTUS justices, encouraging a broader view of privacy and the 4th Amendment than just people who agree with Chief Justice Roberts."

"I'm referring to reforming the Foreign Intelligence and Surveillance Act (FISA), not the 4th Amendment. Networks and so on are already protected under current interpretations of the 4th Amendment.

'So, you are a bit delusional. But I’m feeling charitable, so I’m going to dignify you with a response. \n\nYou’re conflating and confusing a large variety of things. You’re also assuming that I’m supporting a “liberal/progressive” movement by celebrating application of the law. I’m not even a registered Democrat... I personally do not care for the hardcore “SJW” types, as I hold it as one of my core principles that **the road to hell is paved with the best of intentions**. From a broader historical perspective, while they are progressive in stated intent, their methods resemble Puritanism. I do not believe that the ends justify the means, so while I may agree with some of their ends, I think their means are to the detriment of their cause. \n\nBut they are not an aspect of some grander conspiracy. I agree that there are many psychopaths in many different social and political movements. Some do a better job of quarantining or expelling those elements than others. \n\nBut to extrapolate personal anecdotal experience to some kind of grand conspiracy is a bridge too far. \n**You’re acting out what is called “illusory pattern perception”.**\n\nMore importantly, it doesn’t achieve anything. It’s neither helpful nor productive to assume that everything you don’t like is a part of a single grand scheme. It blinds you to reality, stripping you of your ability to act.\n\nI think we’d agree that there are absolutely groups that seek to cloud people’s judgement and compel them to live in a fantasy world. If you can’t identify or talk about something in concrete meaningful terms, you can’t effect any change. \n\n**You should strongly consider reevaluating who those groups are, and which ones are currently most dangerous.**\n\nStart by asking this: what group of people most romanticizes politics? What group of people most strongly reduces politics and ideology to aesthetics and branding? What group _must_ continuously invent or designate enemies in order to maintain cohesion? What group is defined as being _against_ certain things, rather than _for_ certain things? \n\nEverything you’ve just said actually does probably apply to the constellation of alt-right/white nationalist/etc movements, which have practiced leaderless federation (like al Qaeda) for decades. This is a pattern that is substantiated by law enforcement reports (look up the spaghetti dinners), unlike what you’re suggesting. '

'> 1) Obama was worshipped by the media, and he still is. In fact, Obama exacerbated racism by being as divisive as he was. By the way, you may recall Rosen , a real journalist, was spies on by Obama and his cronies.\n\nObama [is actually okay with criticism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HO-9AZjflY) and this recording of him shows that he understands why it\'s important.  Meanwhile you have a sitting President call his critics "fake news".  His mountain of Twitter fires is an embarrassingly funny and horrifying thing to watch because of what this implies.  Here is a great video from Republican Senator Jeff Flakes on [Trump\'s Stalin-like attacks on the press](http://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/fl-op-jeff-flake-trump-media-attacks-20180119-story.html).  Sure there are biases.  And depending on where you sit, it\'s almost deafening depending on how sensitive your hearing is.  But no President should ever attack the press the way Trump has.  It\'s detrimental to our Republic and democracy.\n\nSo again, out of the two, which President attacked the press for doing their job?  It\'s pretty obvious.\n\n> 2) You deserve credit that Teddy applied his statement to himself and all past and future presidents; however, it is common knowledge that Obama is a narcissist and would never handle criticism with grace, but neither does Trump, so what ... probably need a big ego to be POTUS. As far as Trump’s tweets, people like me sincerely appreciate the unfiltered message, a message that the MSM cannot easily diffuse. Alas, Obama has the press eating from his hand and he was not vetted adequately in 2006/2007. If he were I’m confident Hillary would have just finished her 2nd term.\n\nHere is an interesting article titled, [7 signs you\'re dating a narcissist...](http://www.businessinsider.com/narcissistic-personality-disorder-signs-2018-4).  I can\'t think of a better example of a narcissist than Trump.  He is the classic example of narcissism.  You could even say he\'s the best at it.\n\n> 3) As a corporate leader myself, I expect my staff’s loyalty and they freely give it to me as we’re in sync for what we want to accomplish. I think the POTUS deserves loyalty, after all, Holder held Obama’s water for him and there is no argument of that.

Also, how loyal was Obama to Lois Lerner as she has her full pension even though she broke federal law, but the loyalist Obama didn’t investigate with integrity.\n\nAs a former military leader, you would think that I expected loyalty and respect from those under me.  But I never once did in my near decade of service.  Instead, I chose to lead by example.  Because ultimately I wanted to earn their trust.  A good leader commands from a position of trust and not of fear.  If I happen to gain their respect then fine.  But that isn\'t an objective in itself.  Getting the job done is.\n\nTo demand loyalty, or to even ask for a loyalty oath, is categorically un-American as I\'ve pointed out earlier.  \n\n> 4) Re Trump opting out of the Vietnam war - did Obama serve? Was he even eligible to serve? Maybe one day in the not too distant future much truth will be revealed about Obama and many will not believe the truth. Time will tell...\n\nI\'ve spent a quite a bit of time reflecting on my own military service, especially now that I\'ve been out, and wonder if I had made a difference at all.  On sleepless nights like this, I would think about the decisions I\'ve made not only about my time in but also life in general.  Sometimes I would turn to biographies and history to aid me with these questions.  What is it that made some people heroes and some people not?  And I believe it comes down to how ordinary people respond to extraordinary situations.  \n\nTake for example the [remarkable story of combat medic awarded Medal of Honor](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/remarkable-story-combat-medic-awarded-medal-honor-48954452).  MOH recipient Jim Moore was one of countless draftees into the Army during the Vietnam War.  And despite great danger to himself, he saved ten of his fellow soldiers while under enemy fire for around 48 hours.\n\nDuring Vietnam, with the draft and our nation at war, sometimes that decision to be in the Army was made for them.  This isn\'t to take away from those who served during the draft.  But, to me, it does amplify the actions of those who chose precisely to avoid it.  While Jim Moore, John McCain, and many others suffered through their extraordinary experiences because of the Vietnam War in 1968, the 21 year old Trump [had it pretty good](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/07/20/what-donald-trump-was-up-to-while-john-mccain-was-suffering-as-a-prisoner-of-war/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.5a7315afc9eb).  After dodging the war, he lived a privileged life paid for by his peers.  One of whom (John McCain) whom he had the gall to say was not a war hero for being a POW during the Vietnam War. \n\nAnd due to these sacrifices by these Americans, and no thanks to Trump, Obama grew up in a period of relative peace and optimism by the time he was of age.  Would he have dodged the war had he been born years earlier?  That\'s hard to say and pointless to speculate on.  After all, you can\'t have war heroes nor draft dodgers without a war.\n\n> I’m not here to argue with you, but constructive criticism as we are having here may be beneficial to our country, but the divisiveness of political polarity at this time portends a major shock before normalization may set in again. IDK :-/\n\nWe should be constructively critical and be wary of the divisiveness of the current political climate.  Something I wish President Trump would work towards through example.  But I can\'t think of a President in recent times who has done more to damage constructive criticism nor fan the divisiveness of the parties.\n\n> With an open mind and mediocre reasoning skills anyone can acknowledge that Trump has and continues to bring change to America, and mostly good imvho. My heritage comes from an Eastern European country that was under communist rule. Believe me when I say we don’t need that here! Let’s keep America the land of the free and the home if the brave. We can, you know, but it takes discipline and work - something many fail to understand.\n\nI am a Conservative who urged others to keep an open mind and to "give him a chance" when he surprisingly won the election.  Obviously I don\'t do that anymore.  While I didn\'t vote for him, I was not a fan of Hillary.  Also because of my heritage, I am vehemently against dictators and communism.  But because I\'m an American, I am about the rule of law.  Above any partisanship.  That no one is above the law.  Especially not even a sitting POTUS.'

'Well, Fox "News" is his biggest mainstream reporter, and they\'re not even legally a news broadcaster.\n\nThe media should most certainly not release any evidence at this time, this process and Mueller\'s investigation need to be untainted, now more than ever. Strict by-the-book lawmanship will win out, because if there is no mud to sling, the Trump supporter base slowly shrinks.'
"That's a fair way of looking at it.\n\nIf this were a set diagram, then 'conspiracy' and 'bribery' would be overlapping circles inside 'criminality' which is itself a circle inside  a larger circle of 'collusion'.  By denying 'collusion' Trump denies all illegality inside the biggest circle.\n\nThere remains another possibility outside the collusion circle, however, in that Russia supported Trump of its own free will, independent of Trump's actions, perhaps with knowledge of Trump's (blackmailable) corrupt finances with respect to Russia.  Just having a pee-pee tape is a good reason to support Trump.\n"

The little gendered slur would actually hide in empty offices and closets waiting to get a chance to meet with him.  They should have sent her back to California. \n\nI have wondered in my mind if Hillary would have been better off if she had divorced him.

What crap judgment. '
'If my husband wants his dick sucked by someone other than me, he had better be upfront about it.  And vice versa. It is not the sex, it is the dishonesty.  THAT is the problem.

If a couple has an agreement that they can have sex with others then fine.  But, if not, then dishonesty and sneaking around are not cool. And you know this.  '

'Technically while Clinton was impeached, he was only impeached in the House but acquitted of both articles of impeachment in the Senate. I’m no legal expert but I believe acquitted isn’t the same thing as guilty. \n\n> February 12, the Senate voted on whether to remove Clinton from office. The president was acquitted on both articles of impeachment. The prosecution needed a two-thirds majority to convict but failed to achieve even a bare majority. Rejecting the first charge of perjury, 45 Democrats and 10 Republicans voted “not guilty,” and on the charge of obstruction of justice the Senate was split 50-50. After the trial concluded, President Clinton said he was “profoundly sorry” for the burden his behavior imposed on Congress and the American people.\n\nhttps://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/12/19\n\nMeanwhile Nixon admitted guilt for crimes during Watergate by accepting Ford’s pardon:\n\n>At a 2014 panel discussion, Ford’s lawyer during that period, Benton Becker, explained another part of the President’s motivation was a 1915 Supreme Court decision, Burdick v. United States, which made Nixon accept his guilt in the Watergate controversy by also accepting the pardon.\n\n>The Court’s ruling in Burdick was that a pardon carried an "imputation of guilt" and accepting a pardon was "an admission of guilt.” Becker said he took copies of the Burdick decision to California when he met with former President Nixon, and under Ford’s instructions, he walked through the Burdick decision with Nixon.\n\n>Becker said the discussion with Nixon was very difficult, and the former President kept trying to change the subject way from Burdick until he acknowledged Becker’s discussion about what the Supreme Court decision meant.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/constitutioncenter.org/amp/blog/the-nixon-pardon-in-retrospect-40-years-later\n\nThe two are not the same.'

"Ok, I understand that we're in The_Mueller, but tangential as OP's post is to this sub, I still don't understand what point you're trying to make. What do this have to do with the historical stats OP posted? \n\nAlso, this quote is not precisely what happened. The Special Counsel was created to examine Russian hacking into the election. It is absolutely possible that Trump is exonerated or at least not directly implicated. The investigation isn't directly about him...it's about Russian meddling in our election. We keep forgetting this because Trump's ties to Russia are numerous. "
"That's both sad and hilarious. \n\nMueller has consistently demonstrated the actual noble qualities of conservatism, while their yardsale muppet 1)wasn't a republican or a conservative that long ago, and 2) demonstrates zero of the noble qualities of conservatism while being absolutely a caricature of everything wrong with that party.  "
'Well I know that, and you know that, and Mueller knows that, and even Trump and the GOP know that. \n\nApparently, the only ones who don’t know that are those who were duped into voting for him. \n\nThen again, they clearly chose to vote against their own best interests, so how smart could they really be?'
"This is known.  The question is who did they assist and did they know?\n\nSome say it's against trump.  I disagree, I say they are seeing which (if any) campaign personnel were involved.  It may very well lead to Trump, but that is not the intent.\n\nIt could also be he was completely oblivious to all of these people in his campaign (and family?) making shady deals/meetings with Russians.  That would mean he was the most ignorant person/father to ever run for office.  I personally don't think he's that dumb/ill informed.  I think he is like a mafia boss.  Keeps his hands as clean as possible and has his people commit the crimes. But that's just my opinion, let's see what comes out of the investigation."
"It's almost like there's bipartisan support that Trump is a piece of shit."
'I just don’t understand how or why why Trump is the person people blindly support.

Libertarians are just as manipulated by those in charge, and to a worse end. The rich ruling class use libertarians to push anti-regulation, anti-worker, and anti-middle class propaganda. Trickle down economics, abolishing the minimum wage, all that garbage is just rich people using Libertarians for their own agenda. It's exactly why it won't work in real life, it only makes the system and the people more easily manipulable when you remove accountability and expect everyone to play nice. In real life, people don't play nice. Our system of government is far from perfect, but a glance at a history book will show you why an absentee government is a bad idea."

'If the downgrade was not signed by Chief of Staff, does it even work? Also, he was downgraded from "top secret" to "secret" — should we really count it as a big win? :('
'Apparently Secret is basic, like clipped newspaper articles that might reveal a person of interest, that kind of level.\n\nOne thing is clear if it’s a legit downgrade he can no longer do his job, you need all the intel the other side has to be an effective negotiator/representative.'
'While this is true, Sensitive Compartmented Information is declassified to individuals on a "need to know" basis.  Even persons with Top Secret clearance must individually have a "need to know" the specific intelligence that\'s in the document.\n\nSo, the fact that the President, under Dept. of the Navy v. Egan, has broad powers to determine "need to know" is a bit of a trap... the more intel that Trump declassifies to Kushner in cases where he *clearly* does not have a need to know will only tangibly hurt Trump\'s credibility (Mueller may present it before a Judge or Grand Jury to demonstrate a pattern of conspiracy) and raise the suspicions of all around him... This will also increase the probability of more rats turning on Trump.'

I'm glad we both understand and agree that this is in fact the current state of things, being that Mueller is investigating the Trump campaign's collusion with Russian officials and has now produced a confession from Papadopoulos admitting to those events taking place, with a timeline of events of contacts with Russians and Trump campaign officials."

'As a hypothetical question do you believe that the major news outlets that are supposed to inform the public instead of providing a biased narrative serving as propaganda should be allowed to continue that behavior?

">As a hypothetical question do you believe that the major news outlets that are supposed to inform the public instead of providing a biased narrative serving as propaganda should be allowed to continue that behavior?\n\nI believe our founding principles have led to astounding levels of freedom and prosperity and aim to see the constitution upheld.

'Statistics are too easily manipulated to be worth anything. What I do is look at events like what just happened with the NFL for example. They are led to believe that ALL AMERICANS are supportive of this BLM/leftist/anti-Trump narrative and they pretty much forced many of those players to kneel. Then the same company that really is only concerned about profit sees how actual Americans actually react and they change their policy to tell them not to do that anymore. People can call it anecdotal like you just did, but more and more I hear from people a message of "I hate the guy but why does everything have to be about Trump." For me to hear that from people who have been wildly liberal since their hippy days is way more indicative of a changing tide than any slanted poll will ever be. I see the same thing being repeated by others in other parts of the country. Give it a little time and you will start to notice the same thing. If you were able to step outside of your narrative for a minute, haven\'t you seen the same pattern over and over? At first people get riled up about something, but gradually more and more lose interest and get back to what is actually important to them like their friends, family, and jobs. A hardcore group always remains with every president ever who will trash him with an unhealthily obsessive frequently, but that is not the pattern for the majority of people at all. Let my proof be time. Get back to me if it turns out I am wrong.   \n  \nEdit: maybe another example that might help you understand is the election. The news, the experts, the statistics went on and on about Hillary\'s guaranteed victory. Instead of listening to that I watched the footage of the massive stadiums he was filling with supporters compared to Tiny high school basketball courts that would be barely filled for her. I I tried to tell people this but was met with ridicule. I even had a relative that lost a lot of money betting on an online site because of how convinced they were by the mainstream media that you and others like you are still listening to.'
'You might not read them, but you are not the only person I am writing for in these forums when I respond to you. I have seen people start to come around and see things a little more clearly from time to time and that makes it worth being called names and mocked by people like you who probably have good intentions but have just been misled by people who are professionals at doing so.'

And it was totally legal. Working in Russia isn\'t a crime, aiding and abetting them in an effort to undermine the electoral process however, is.\n\n>Didn\'t Hillary and Obama give Russia tons of uranium? \n\nNo. Russia\'s Rosatom purchased a controlling stake in the mining company Uranium One and with it 10-20% of our uranium reserves. Because of this, the transaction had to be overseen by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, of which Clinton was a cabinet member. The commitee had no say in whether or not the deal went through, their only job being to evaluate whether or not it presented a national security risk and inform the president of their findings. All nine members of the committee approved, and with that president Obama approved it. In addition, all that meant was that Rosatom held an economic stake in US uranium. We didn\'t give them any uranium, because exporting it would require additional approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. We did export and sell some of it, but none of it went to Russia.\n\n>Remember the quote " tell Putin i will have more flexibility after the election". \n\nOpenness to negotiation is not collusion nor illegal. \n\n>Didn\'t Podesta own shares in a Russian bank under his kids name?\n\nI know very little about this so I can\'t comment.

Many of them were in place when that sub was genuinely for political discussion, rather than what it has become now, which is a forum for gossip about Melania, opinion pieces, and speculation. It flat out says in the sidebar now that it\'s for "politcal news", in other words it\'s barely a step removed from facebook. If you subscribe to the sub, you know that every month or so, the mods post a sticky to discuss what the subscribers want to see done. The people who show up can\'t even agree on what they want to see, ie, last month, many of us wanted opinion pieces to be clearly tagged as opinion, because they aren\'t genuinely news.

'Applicable username.  3 indictments, 1 confirmed witness flip and 2 more obvious ones incoming.  He literally went to Jared to pressure Mike Flynn which means Flynn has at least some of the goods.  What bias, BTW?  Mueller is a Republican, who was appointed FBI Director by George W. Bush (a Republican), appointed by Rod Rosenstein (a Republican) and enjoys support from almost all Republican members of Congress.  Maybe leave the_Dumbass and Fox News for 5 seconds and you\'ll be able to see that the process is working as it should.     \nI want to tell you as a New Yorker, if you don\'t think Trump has skeletons in his closet working in NY real estate, you\'ve got another thing coming entirely.  Anything Mueller digs up as a result of the Russia investigation (money laundered apartments in Trump Tower and double-book-value real estate deals to Russian oligarchs in Palm Beach) are fair game.  Good luck.\n     \nI can tell this story is definitely:     \n[](#b8)     \n\nWelcome!  I look forward to many "debates" with you.'
'It’s more than that. It’s psychological warfare. It was hacking political opponents of Trump in collusion with Trump Campaign officials. It was a quid pro quo. We help you get elected through propaganda influence, hacking campaign officials of your opponents if you ease sanctions on Russia. If you don’t let us help you, well we have these incriminating documents about you.'
"That video actually captures 2016 for me quite nicely.  An insane year I don't think any of us will forget or care to live again.  It was amusing for maybe a week and then it started to get batshit insane."
'>As a conspiracy theorist\n\nI wouldn\'t identify as a conspiracy theorist but at this point we *know* the government is spying on everything we do. I can\'t see how anyone can trust the government. \n\n>batshit crazy political correctness, social justice warriors and the new insane direction of feminism\n\nI hear you. Social justice is a good thing and I believe all people deserve equality. I think most people feel that way too. I\'d say don\'t let some idiots on Tumblr taint your view of this but with colleges planning "Whites stay home day" (or whatever it was called) it\'s hard to say it\'s just Tumblr. \n\n\nYou seem like a fairly reasonable person so I have to ask. \n\nWhat is it about Trump that you support? What has he done to earn your support? '
'That deal is such a diversion from your dear leader. No uranium has left the United States because it’s against the law. Furthermore uranium isn’t some precious resource.\n\nDude, you’re so delusional! Do you have no thoughts on the fact that the campaign had visited with Russia on numerous occasions? That DT jr. has emails discussing COLLUSION with the Russian government? Or the number of times Sessions has perjured himself over this shit?\n\nYou’re lost dude. '
'You do have to understand that your perception is being peppered by the media you consume.  I don\'t agree with the "did you just assume their gender?" outrage SJW people, either.  I don\'t approve of the violent Antifa nuts, nor do I approve of the Brown Shirts on the other side.  I do, however, agree with respecting people\'s right to declare their gender because it costs us nothing and gives them a chance to be who they are.  There were studies where they did autopsies on transgender people and they found a specific element in their brain only found in the opposite gender, so their feeling is not altogether wrong, scientifically.  I\'m a big believer in kindness and acceptance because this world is harsh enough as it is to everyone.      \nI would also caution you from taking on a political philosophy based upon the behavior and actions of fringe groups.  There are bigger things at work like healthcare, the tax code & basic human rights in play, here.  We all basically want the same things for the most part (jobs, prosperity & peace), we just disagree upon the route to get them.'
'It is fascinating! I’m glad you’re taking an interest, that’s the first step to realizing that you’re wrong.'
"Said the person who regularly posts to a Trump cult echo chamber that bans people for questioning the cult narrative.\n\nLol\n\nPlease note that you won't be banned here for debating... You'll just get laughed at heartily and repeatedly..."
'Maybe she moonlights writing reviews on Yelp. \n\n*Have you eaten there?*\n\n"No, I haven\'t eaten there, but the other Yelp reviews I\'ve read say the food looks like it was put through the garbage disposal. I happen to agree with that. It\'s my right to agree with other reviewers, even if I haven\'t dined at the establishment". '
'I wish my party wasn’t full of idiots '
"Everything about that video is gold. She talks about how Comey discredits himself in his own book, but yet she's never read it, which discredits herself. It's like she doesn't stop to think for herself at all"
'Lol did you comment without watching it? Is that the joke you were trying to make? If so, I am impressed by the subtlety.'
"I mean this is actually pretty true of Trump. He cut down his security reports from pages to 1 page with bullet points.. and then he just decided screw it, I don't need them anyways. "
"If he issues corrupt pardons in order to shut people up so they don't talk shit about him I'm thinking that's illegal."
"I wouldn't put it past him. Seems like most Americans are so out of touch with stuff like this and its easier for them to decide that its to much to take in. We're nearly desensitized to seeing another headline about something ridiculous that Trump did. "
'But it\'s on overdrive now. Faux "news" is now a state run propaganda arm of the WH and they aren\'t even hiding it anymore. Everyday they obstruct justice, commit sedition, and flat out lie to people all to try and discredit Mueller. It\'s 24/7 these days. They use words like coup and assasination attempts coming from the FBI. Its scary stuff but the FCC is owned by mango Mussolini as well and they already don\'t classify fox as news it\'s entertainment but they can still get away with calling themselves news for some reason.'
'That’s the thing. To accept a pardon you have to accept guilt, you must make yourself available for further questioning, and you can no longer take the fifth. Guess what happens to your pardon if you lie under oath or to the FBI. And now they know Mueller already has dirt on most or all them... so a pardon is not likely to prevent anyone from spilling beans. At least, not after they see what happens to the first guy that gets pardoned.'
'The [Benghazi ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_investigation_into_the_2012_Benghazi_attack) hearings went on for far longer and came up with just about nothing.  Note that they were a huge deal right up until the election and then quietly ended.   This investigation has been short and yielded far more than most special prosecutorial investigations do.   '
"My guess is if Trump were to really fire Mueller, he'd be sure to do it either the day before or after Christmas. That way most of the country would be too focused on family time to notice and those who do notice at all could easily be labelled un-American scrooges muddying the holiday spirit and trying to politicise in the wrong venue."
"Look man, you're committed to your perspective. I checked your posts and I see you're on the donald (I really don't care about that and I see that you're actually a bit more of a moderate voice over there, we all deserve to have freedom of thought and we all deserve to hold our own beliefs, opinions, etc.) However, many people, myself included, disagree with the notion that this investigation hasn't turned up anything. Paul Manafort anyone?\n\nInvestigations takes time, and there have been some major revelations that many people feel are quite important and deserve further investigation. And while you may not find the prosecution to have proven itself meaningfully, many of your fellow citizens feel very differently.\n\nAlso. If there isn't anything to discover, then why should anyone on Trump's team even bother with addressing the investigation? If there ain't anything there, why waste breath acknowledging it? Why not just let it run through to the end, knowing there ain't anything there?\n\nTo me the answer is clear because it's just the way life is: people who don't have anything to hide don't really worry about other folks going through their dirty laundry. \n\nYou may see things differently, but I really do want you to hear that I respect your right to your own perspective and hope you'll grant folks like me the same liberty."
"Do you think Mueller is going to invent evidence some how? Trump himself said Mueller will exonerate him when the investigation is complete, why would he fire someone that will be exonerating him? Mueller can't invent evidence, \n\n>Unless Mueller pulls something out of thin air soon this case is looking on the verge of collapse.\n\nSo Manifort, Popadopolous, Flynn inditments are all a nothing burger?\n\nHonestly you should take a step back an evaluate Trumps actions, then ask yourself - is that how an innocent person acts? If there is nothing to hide, why is he always trying to discredit the investigation?   "
"> Unless Mueller pulls something out of thin air soon this case is looking on the verge of collapse.\n\nI'm honestly curious how you can think this. They've indicted 3 people, flipped Papadopolous and Flynn and the investigation has been non-stop getting new information. \n\nThe investigation has only been going on since May and has only been ramping up, never winding down. It's just incredible to me that people can hold the opinion that the case is collapsing..."
'> a long, rapidly deteriorating investigation that has failed to yield any results\n\nInvestigations that are short are generally inconclusive.\n\nIt\'s certainly not "deteriorating", let alone rapidly, considering that charges are *just* beginning to be filed. Remember, this isn\'t the first time we\'ve seen this process, let alone even the first time for a sitting President. You don\'t take down someone like Flynn for just "lying" unless he\'s giving you something truly useful, and *those* indictments have yet to drop, because like anyone who\'s ever bothered to be *actually* involved in a legal case, you\'d know that you want to make it as airtight as possible, since if it isn\'t and they\'re acquitted, you can never bring a second case due to Constitutional protections against "double jeopardy", so you better be sure you\'ve covered everything possible the first time.\n\nAs for "failed to yield any results", I\'m confused what you think five indictments are. Manafort and Gates were the transition teams\' campaign managers, and they\'re going to be defending themselves in court soon against some pretty hefty federal charges, *before* they then get indicted on a state level. They\'re going to prison. Then you have not one, not two, but *three* individuals who have "flipped" and are cooperating with the FBI in exchange for leniency *if* they bring in the big fish. \n\nThat you think *any* of what you said in that sentence I quoted is true means you\'re either pushing your own narrative (for whatever reason, I don\'t care which because it doesn\'t matter), or you\'re willfully ignorant of what\'s actually going on here, if not just in outright denial because your ego can\'t handle the idea of being wrong.\n\nAs for Fox being "state propaganda", I\'m confused as to who exactly you think the Koch brothers are, and how you\'re so uninformed as to what they do, who they\'ve bought, how much power they wield, and as to how *anyone* has managed to just ignore the back and forth between Fox news and the White House. Fox doesn\'t have to be *literal" state propaganda (as in Trump is telling them what to air) to fulfill the *function*. So sure, maybe it is a bit dramatic to *call* it that, but it\'s absolutely SPOT FUCKING ON POINT when it comes to how the conservative propaganda machine works. \n\nI\'d say it\'s more fair to say that the Koch brothers are telling both the Trump administration *and* Fox news what to do. It\'s just a silent coup, no big deal, no need to dramatize it by calling it "state propaganda", it\'s easier and more accurate to call it a "state takeover by private elite citizens".\n\n----------\n\nSo while you\'re either a paid provocateur, an ignorant rube, or a delusional sycophant (and I say those as clinical descriptions of behavior, not pejoratives), I urge you to consider the counterarguments to your position - if you\'re so correct, your idea should stand up to self-scrutiny in the light of full information, shouldn\'t they?\n\n-----------\n\nEdit; one last thing, you used the word "reign" to describe Obama\'s presidency. This isn\'t a monarchy.'
'Props for communicating in the best way one can on the internet: with empathy. '
'Yeah, if anything, politics will be **more** focused on during the holidays, when the family\'s together to talk about it. One side effect of the whole "nothing is normal any more" is that Americans can\'t just ignore politics if they care at all about their future, their family\'s future, and the country\'s future. It used to *seem* like it could be safely ignored...then It Happened Here.'

'This investigation is certainly not based off bias against Trump! He can just play the Hillary card by saying "I do not recall" to everything against him, that\'s how the libs get out of trouble!'
'Let\'s see: \n\nYour assertion: Mueller is getting nothing.  Backed up presumably by your big mouth and nothing more.\n\nActual facts: \n- indictments for three top figures, closing the noose around the top leaders including Trump, from a prosecutorial perspective\n- access to financial records and transition emails and taped conversations with Manafort going back to at least 2014 since he was definitely colluding with a known foreign enemy against a potential Western ally (Ukraine)\n- Trump, Jr. definitely going to a meeting in which official Russian government evidence was to be offered in what was indicated as Russian government support for the Trump campaign\n- Eric Trump in 2014 indicating, "We have all the funding we need out of Russia."  http://thehill.com/homenews/news/332270-eric-trump-in-2014-we-dont-rely-on-american-banks-we-have-all-the-funding-we\n- The Trumps in general just having big mouths and willing to talk to pretty much anyone about pretty much anything (Trump giving the Russians Israeli intelligence that wasn\'t supposed to be shared, etc, etc)\n'
"I wonder how many Hillary supporters were on the numerous (how many?) Republican led investigations into Benghazi? How many on the investigations into her emails?  I wonder how many anti-Hillary emails and texts were sent between members of those committees?\n\nSide with no evidence?  My friend, you can't be that naive, can you?"
"Mike Flynn just pled guilty to avoid a slew of charges.  Mueller wouldn't do that unless he gave up something of significant value.  An interesting story to tell, indeed.  We also now know for a fact he subpoenaed Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo.  Good luck on your fantasy island."
'Kevin McCarthy bragged on Hannity that the Benghazi investigations hurt Hillary\'s support.  We can only imagine what was said behind the scenes.  But who really cares about that now.  Certainly not Trey Gowdy.\n\nEvidence: How many meetings were there between the Trump campaign and Russians?  I can\'t remember.  And remind me again how many of those meetings were lied about, and later found out, which made everybody walk back their story?  Like Sessions, "I don\'t recall."  Maybe you can jog my memory.  But I\'m sure the secret meetings between Russians directly connected to the Kremlin and Manafort, Flynn, Gates, Papadopoulos, Kushner, et al were just about adopting babies.  Riiight.  Trump knew Flynn lied to the FBI but didn\'t fire him, then later admitted to this obstruction of justice through a tweet (moron).  Trump Jr had direct communications with wikileaks, a proxy for Russia.  KT McFarland, Trumps transition advisor, said in an email to reassure Russia about sanctions because they threw the election to Trump. 30+ years of Trump being involved with Russian money.  The almost daily tweet of consciousness of guilt by DJT himself.  Geeze, what else...\n\nI gotta go; makin\' crow pie for dinner, wanna come over?\n\n\n'
"So he hasn't found or charged anyone with anything to do with what he's investigating but he's got that info up his sleeve right? Are you basing that on any factual information or just your feelz? \n\n>Newsweek says trump is the least popular president ever LOLZ! \n\nFTFY\n\nAccording to Rasmussen polls (you know the most accurate polls) he's got one of the better approval ratings... but I suppose they're a white supremacist polling agency right? "
'I\'m saying an investigation into a specific thing that hasn\'t found anything is hilarious... or do you think after almost 12 months it\'s somehow beneficial to say you haven\'t found anything when you have and to publicly notify people of things you found that occurred over half a decade ago? Cause that doesn\'t make sense... at all.\n\nPretty sure if he had anything he would have released it... you know, to justify his \'investigation\'.\n\n"How dare someone attack an FBI agent who texted he had an insurance policy to go against the will of the people! FBI agents are untouchable! Doesn\'t mater if they\'re corrupt!" That\'s an interesting mentality you have...'
'I like how you state things by just making assertions without referencing any sources whatsoever.  \n\nHere is the actual, ya know, poll of polls: https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_trump_job_approval-6179.html\n\nAnd even according to your "source" Rasmussen, he is at 44%, which is the most optimistic possible.  I\'m sure you\'re happy you support a minority President, though.'
'Oh boy! OK, let\'s look at another investigation that involved conspiracy against the United States, a looong investigation, and also required investigating many underlings for related charges before the "top dogs" were eventually convicted: the Enron scandal.\n\nThe Mueller investigation has been ongoing for a bit over 7 months. It has already secured guilty pleas from prominent figures Papadopoulos and Flynn, and has arrested Manafort under charges deemed credible by a US justice. That\'s a lot more than the Enron scandal had achieved at this point.\n\nFrom the date that the inquiry was launched into Enron in 2001, it took NINE MONTHS for just ONE conviction of Obstruction of Justice that was later overturned by the Supreme Court. The first major indictment that stuck was issued in 2003. And it took a 6-year investigation from 2001 to 2007, peppered with indictments of underlings, until Enron executives were finally convicted and sentenced. It was a 6 year investigation, and it is now one of the most famous, well-studied, and successful conspiracy investigations in US history.\n\nTL;DR: Some important investigations take years to see results. Be patient. Mueller is coming  :)'

'I mean ... I kind of agree with the guy.\n\n>Religions are shared collections of transcendental beliefs that have been passed on from believers to converts, that are held by adherents to be actively meaningful and serious and either based on (1) formally documented doctrine (organized religion) or (2) established cultural practices (folk religion). In both forms, there are religious professionals who embody formal aspects of the religion and who act in positions of leadership and governance, and there are certain rituals reserved for them to carry out. The beliefs generate practical implications for how life should be lived.\n\n>Religions often include: spiritual explanations of our place in the world in an attempt to answer questions about "why we are here"; worship of deities and/or supernatural entities (including ancestors); conceptions of "holy" and "sacred" activities ideas and objects; set rituals, calendar events based on the changing seasons, distinctive dress codes (especially for religious professionals), codes of morality and action that are given a mandate from a supernaturally great being, from a supernatural force or from the will of the Universe itself; and, a caste of privileged and exalted professionals who have particular claims to be in touch with transcendental forces.\n\nEDIT:  Downvotes without response?  Look, I am one of you.  Donald has to go.  His followers are absurd.  However, there is a larger discussion to be had about what *is* and *is not* a religion.  '
'(Not a lawyer.)  \n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe law differs on whether it is a private business or a government entity. (The government is basically not allowed to do this because of the constitution - freedom of speech/assemble.  \n&nbsp;\n\nThe legal term for treating people differently is to "discriminate".  It\'s a negative term when associated with racism/sexism/etc, but it just describes differences in treatment. An employer discriminates when he gives one employee a raise for stellar work and doesn\'t give that raise to everyone. A business discriminates when giving lunch specials or volume pricing.  \n&nbsp;\n\nWith a private business (or an individual person), they have the right to treat different people differently  for any reason provided they aren\'t doing it based on one of several "protected classes" - e.g race, religion, sex and others. (Some classes are only protected on a State level by individual State laws- sexual orientation is the most visible one.)  \n&nbsp;\n\nPolitical party or political beliefs are not protected classes.  \n&nbsp;\n\n\nEmployers can fire people for their political beliefs (at least in most areas as would be "at will" employees).  \n&nbsp;  \n\nThe precedent is not being set here. It is long established. There is a balance between infringing on the behavior of individuals and businesses and protecting the rights of people being excluded for the political beliefs. If this became a significant problem, the state/federal solution would be to create political belief to be a protected class (as was done for race, sex and religion). Given that this isn\'t a routine or widespread issue, that isn\'t about to happen.   \n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe counter argument would be - would you want to prohibit a Jewish owned restaurant from being able to kick out a group of customers in full Nazi regalia?  Does a Trump Hotel have the legal right to refuse Stormy Daniel from doing a press conference from a hotel ballroom if she wants to rent it for the day? Can a landscaper refuse to take the job to tend the grounds of the KKK headquarters?'
'Black people are a protected class, Trump supporters are not. '
'I don\'t know if that\'s fair, because even though it appears to us that the majority of his supporters suffer most in relation to his policy decisions while being sold on the idea they\'re being helped, I don\'t think calling it a cult is constructive. \n\nAlso, "one person\'s freedom fighter is another\'s terrorist" sort of idea applies to the hate group aspect. I think that the best approach is to empathise, seek to understand, and respect them as fellow human beings. I think that the best way to approach someone\'s *faith* without encroaching is to be loving towards them. That doesn\'t entail skirting around topics or tip toeing, it just means not labelling them, leveling with them as a human, not categorizing or disregarding them as being part of a cult or hate group, that will only incite an emotional/ego based kneejerk reactionary response based on their association with those two terms.\n\nI believe that both cults and hate groups are born from the same emotion: **fear**'
'>... if it included anything that a sufficient number of people were especially enthusiastic about.\n\nI don\'t think that is the case here, because to me it seems like many of whom I\'ve encountered are re-allocating *faith* to him. Their support of him typically is rooted in that, which is hard to argue with, and quickly devolves into name-calling and general breaks in communication. \n\nI agree with you, as do many scholars on the legal definition of "religion" but it\'s been evolving ever since that amendment was put on paper. Check out "Defining Religion in the First Amendment: a Functional Approach" from Cornell University. I just read through it, pretty interesting. \n\nThe conclusion is distinctly different from Trump support, but I wanted to offer my perspective to show how this person might think of it like a religion.  The main difference in my opinion being that belief in him is not existential to the self, but to the ego.'

'To many at this point the MAGA hat is representative of some pretty repulsive viewpoints. Those that wear them are usually doing it for the same reason someone might wear a shirt that says "fuck you you fucking fuck" but worse because the underlying message is deeper.\n\nIt\'s kind of like when Richard Spencer attempts to soften public perceptions of NAZI/KKK ideology by changing the labeling involved, the looks involved, even the language involved in order to penetrate the mainstream and draw support or influence the easily influenced. \n\nI\'m not saying all people who wear MAGA hats are white nationalists seeking an ethno-state for whites only but they do share a common thread with those people and don\'t make any attempts to distance themselves from it and that is pretty telling.'

"I'm not an expert on uranium, so I was hoping you could help me make sense of some things. \n\nFor instance, why wouldn't Canada just sell their own uranium? They're one of the world's two leading producers anyway, along with Kazakhstan. \n\nI've even read that Canada might actually be number one in terms of overall production potential, and it seems that Canadian uranium production is probably the primary basis of the US and Canada's strategic alliance going back to the Cold War (the US needed to build those nukes somehow). The United States, on the other hand, is number nine in uranium production, just behind China and just ahead of Ukraine. \n\nBut Russia, which number five in uranium production, apparently needs to import uranium from a country which is only *number nine* in uranium production? Is that right?\n\nLike I said, I'm not an expert on uranium, but I thought you might be able to help me make sense of all of this."

The Clintons will probably never be prosecuted for the crimes they commited just like Trump will probably never be prosecuted for the crimes he didn't commit. "
"I will admit that the following part sounds bad:\n\n>Mr. Christensen, 65, noted that despite assurances by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that uranium could not leave the country without Uranium One or ARMZ obtaining an export license — which they do not have — yellowcake from his property was routinely packed into drums and trucked off to a processing plant in Canada.\n\n>Asked about that, the commission confirmed that Uranium One has, in fact, shipped yellowcake to Canada even though it does not have an export license. Instead, the transport company doing the shipping, RSB Logistic Services, has the license. A commission spokesman said that “to the best of our knowledge” most of the uranium sent to Canada for processing was returned for use in the United States. A Uranium One spokeswoman, Donna Wichers, said 25 percent had gone to Western Europe and Japan. At the moment, with the uranium market in a downturn, nothing is being shipped from the Wyoming mines.\n\nHowever, it also sounds like it's a long way from Russia *literally having control* of 20% of the United States' uranium supply, since it still seems like the vast majority of the uranium being mined by Uranium One inside the US is also being sold inside the US, and like US energy producers and and other American consumers of uranium still have an open market in which to shop around for their uranium. In other words, they have more choices than to shop at Rosatom-owned Uranium One, and thus get charged whatever price that Uranium One thinks is fair.\n\nAlso, I suppose that a lot of people probably assume that each country's uranium production is strictly nationalized or something, with uranium being a strategic resource, and if a person delves into this controversy while carrying that particular assumption with them, than the notion of 'losing 20% of our uranium to Russia' sounds all the worse. \n\nHowever, just doing a bit of reading about it, the uranium business seems like it's actually a lot more open and commercial than most people would assume, and like the term 'uranium supply' really refers to that of the entire world -- not just that of a single country -- with uranium pretty much being just another globally-traded commodity which has producers, sellers, buyers, distribution chains, fluctuations in price, et cetera.\n\nTo be sure, none of the Uranium One stuff *sounds* particularly good, and it looks like it was a bad decision in hindsight, even if just because of the optics that it ended up generating. If -- in some alternate universe -- *I* had been the one making the decision, I suppose that like most people, I would have said no to it. However, relations between the US and Russia were not as icy then as they are now, and the whole deal was apparently part of a rather broadly-supported effort (however ill-advised) to warm them up (with that dumb 'reset button' and all of that).\n\nAlso, in order for there to be a quid pro quo between the Clintons and contributors to their foundation who owned shares of such-and-such company, don't some things having to do with the timeline (specifically the times at which such-and-such people sold off their stakes in such-and-such company) need to be a bit different? Also, doesn't it also fail to explain the willingness of the other cabinet department heads to to sign off on the sale? \n\nI'm trying to keep an open mind about it, but I'm failing to be completely convinced that what Hillary Clinton (along with her husband) did here makes her a traitor to her nation. A mediocre states-person, sure, but not a traitor to her nation."

Trumps opponents are totally ineffectual against what he is and what he represents.

'This was predicted when the Mueller investigation(s) would appear to reach "maturity", which means that it may be time to issue indictments. \n\nThe problem with that though, is that it takes away resources from ongoing investigations that will bear even more "fruit" down the line. When you start assigning attorneys who may be leading several lines of investigation, to actual court cases or pending indictments, you will lose resources needed to continue investigations.\n\nUnless, of course, you hire more attorneys, or, farm off some of your "ripe" cases to other Federal District Attorneys\' offices.\nThis appears to be happening now.\n\nPart and parcel to good prosecutions and successful trials, are estimating your work load as best as you can based on current evidence and staffing, and then making sure you have all the necessary resource on hand to carry it out.\n\nIt seems Mueller is "clearing the decks" for some action.'

He is a farmer and so is his immediate family, in a family business.  They go to one of those obscure conservative churches you find in the more rural areas, but not the country so to speak.  The have farmer friends, that most likely go to same church.  They ingest the same news from the same sources.  Their faith blinds them to the opinions like Trump is supporting the Evangelicals, I am evangelical.   Therefore Trump = Good, because he is forwarding my most important priority, GOD.   Trust me, the whole Christian faith is an apocalyptic faith.  They literally believe jeebus is coming back for them for the magical ascendance into cloudy paradise.   They view the world as ecumenical and for the use of man to reach paradise.  This is encouraged by no challenges or injected ideas and tons of peer pressure though tight family bonds and group think.   People are scared and don\'t want to think.   Fear is primal and people are diggin in, expecting this holy war or something.   '

This summary was written by Nunes, who was on Trump’s transition team and has ties to the people being investigated himself. It’s in his personal interest to sow seeds of distrust against the FBI. \n\nWe don’t get to see the full warrant, we only get to see this summary. Actually it isn’t so much a summary as it is an op-ed piece. It’s Nunes’ conclusions that he drew up in order to discredit the FBI. According to the people who have read the full memo, it leaves out substantial information. \n\nThis warrant had information from the Steele dossier, but did it have enough corroborating evidence to support the claims pulled from the dossier? It probably did because the dozens of people in the FBI that compiled it and the judge on the FISA court thought it was enough evidence to continue the surveillance. \n\nDon’t forget, Carter had been dealing with Russian agents in the past well before he was part of the Trump team. He was already being surveilled when he joined the team and this warrant was just a request to continue the surveillance (which they have to renew every 90 days). \n'

Maybe you don\'t know what those words mean, but endearing means "inspiring affection" and pensive means "reflecting deep or serious thought."

There is a conditioning through propaganda and "fake news" much like what the alt right press is using now. Its effective, but to a point.

Evangelicals, are "true believers" and are unshakable in their faith.\n\nResearchers and Historians were dumbfounded when looking how we had the Rise of Adolph Hitler and fanatical Naziism. looking at the rallys at Nurenberg saw the same tactics used there, repeatable for evangelicals and cult leaders. There is a conditioning through propaganda and "fake news" much like what the alt right press is using now. Its effective, but to a point. But the leaders of these movements know what can fly and what does not.You can pretty much lie, deceive, fornicate, but if you can do something like promising a greater good for them, like stopping abortion, make more jobs, achieve a higher purpose, they don\'t care what you do privately'
'If Trump wins it will be because the GOP is actively working to limit voting rights and reduce the number of people who vote.'
'**Evangelicalism**\n\nEvangelicalism (), evangelical Christianity, or evangelical Protestantism, is a worldwide, crossdenominational movement within Protestant Christianity which maintains the belief that the essence of the Gospel consists of the doctrine of salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ\'s atonement. Evangelicals believe in the centrality of the conversion or the "born again" experience in receiving salvation, in the authority of the Bible as God\'s revelation to humanity, and in spreading the Christian message. The movement has had a long presence in the Anglosphere before spreading further afield in the 19th, 20th and early 21st centuries.\n\nIts origins are usually traced to 1738, with various theological streams contributing to its foundation, including English Methodism, the Moravian Church (in particular its bishop Nicolaus Zinzendorf and his community at Herrnhut), and German Lutheran Pietism.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

'Let me judge you as an individual here and now:\n\nYou are obviously too stupid to realize you just practiced what you blamed others for. \n\nPersonally, I do hold groups to account, or in other words, I judge, and I\'ll go further and readily call anyone a liar who says or implies they do not judge.  It\'s human nature for one, and secondly, it is important for recognizing failures and fixing them.  Typically the people who lambast others for judging groups are the ones being judged currently and not liking the result while also seeing truth in it which leaves them impotent with a rebuttal of their own.  In short:  they can only blame the messenger.  They go the intellectually lazy route...\n\nLet me judge Christian Conservatives while we are at it:\n\nAs individuals I think they are some of the finest people.  One\'s who do their best for others and really do give of themselves.  I can say that for many individuals from other groups as well though. \n\nAs a collective however, they are assholes.\n\nThey show how impotent their god is everytime they try to codify into law what their god and message can\'t do alone.  That is anything from discriminating against homosexuals to blue laws like not selling alcohol while Sunday Mass is happening.  To them freedom means, "you are free to be exactly how I want you to be."  THAT makes a group assholes!\n\nSecondly, they hold a distorted, and growing currently, sense of humanity insofar as it being evil.  The math works as follows:\n\nA family has a loving grandfather who is diagnosed with Stage 3 Cancer of some form.  He is healed of his condition.  \n\nThe family MEANS WELL, they hold good intention when they thank their god privately and publicly.  They mean no harm and are just genuinely thankful to their god.  \n\nThey also mean no harm when they do little to nothing to publicly thank the doctors and nurses who performed the surgery and administered care.  Meant no harm when they failed to thank publicly the many thousands, possibly millions of accumulated hours of research that went into finding treatments and cures for only that particular form of cancer.  Meant zero harm when they failed to thank the labor that went into constructing, managing, and directing the institutions that gave care and performed research. \n\nThey gave, publicly, all the praise and thanks to their god. \n\nThat would be alright!  However, they don\'t hate their god when things go wrong.  Instead they hate mankind. \n\nSo their worldview grows distorted when they thank their god where others can hear it for all the good we see, and then blame man for all the bad we see without at least a proportional amount of good we see credited to mankind as well. \n\nNothing accomplishes this better than a congregation of people, meaning no harm, doing this over and over; a church. \n\nThis is a truly evil philosophy.  It\'s manipulative.  It lifts up the church when it did nothing without lifting up those institutions which did everything.  "To God give all the glory" is detrimental to mankind for the sake of the church, the same church that demands you practice this. \n\nThe Church has managed to find a way to take all of the praise, without all of the pomp and stance, by gaining it vicariously through a book it chooses too. \n\nSo evil...'

'> The poll, released Friday, finds that just more than half of those surveyed, 53 percent, say that the special counsel probe is a "fair" investigation into Trump\'s campaign, while 28 percent say it is "unfair." This marks an increase from 48 percent who said the investigation was "fair" in the same poll last month.\n> \n> In addition, respondents said they are more likely to trust Mueller than Trump. Given an option between the two, 55 percent said they would believe Mueller over Trump, compared to 30 percent that said the reverse.\n> \n> Most Americans still have a positive view of the FBI despite weeks of attacks from Trump and congressional Republicans over the bureau\'s handling of both the Russia investigation and the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\'s private email server, the poll finds.\n> \n> Seventy-one percent of Americans said the bureau was just trying to do its job, compared to 23 percent who told the poll they believe the FBI is biased against the president.\n\nWould like to see those numbers of support for Mueller a little higher, but I\'m still glad that it looks like all of Trump\'s bluster and rage is serving mostly to push average Americans away from him.'

'If you\'re actually interested, [this is how a former CIA officer breaks down what you\'re calling \'a piss dossier\':](https://www.justsecurity.org/44697/steele-dossier-knowing/)\n\n>  In this special Just Security article, highly respected former member of the CIA’s Senior Intelligence Service, John Sipher examines the Steele dossier using methods that an intelligence officer would to try to validate such information. Sipher concludes that the dossier’s information on campaign collusion is **generally credible** when measured against standard Russian intelligence practices, events subsequent to Steele’s reporting, and information that has become available in the nine months since Steele’s final report. The dossier, in Sipher’s view, is not without fault, including factual inaccuracies. Those errors, however, do not detract from an overarching framework that has proven to be ever more reliable as new revelations about potential Trump campaign collusion with the Kremlin and its affiliates has come to light in the nine months since Steele submitted his final report.\n\nThe "pee tape" part is meaningless.  It\'s the rest of what well-placed Russians told Steele they understand the FSB has on Trump that is important.\n\nThe simple fact that Steele himself took his reports to US law enforcement is a hell of a statement that he has high confidence in his sources and what they have told him.'

'**Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections**\n\nThe Russian government interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election in order to increase political instability in the United States and to damage Hillary Clinton\'s presidential campaign by bolstering the candidacies of Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein. A January 2017 assessment by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) stated that Russian leadership favored presidential candidate Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, and that Russian president Vladimir Putin personally ordered an "influence campaign" to harm Clinton\'s electoral chances and "undermine public faith in the US democratic process."On October 7, 2016, the ODNI and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) jointly stated that the U.S. Intelligence Community was confident that the Russian Government directed recent hacking of e-mails with the intention of interfering with the U.S. election process. According to the ODNI′s January 6, 2017 report, the Russian military intelligence service (GRU) had hacked the servers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the personal Google email account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and forwarded their contents to WikiLeaks. Although Russian officials have repeatedly denied involvement in any DNC hacks or leaks, there is strong forensic evidence linking the DNC breach to known Russian operations.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

Trump can’t pardon himself (untested, but pretty logical) so his best move is to wait things out and hope the Senate stays Republican enough to prevent a post-impeachment conviction and removal. \n\n~~Remember that impeachment is for offenses while in office.

"Not OP but it's pretty well-known that Mueller was the director of the FBI during the Enron investigation and spearheaded this investigation. That's probably the first accomplishment people tend to list for him."
"Sure can.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/13/opinion/robert-mueller-enron-russia-investigation.html\n\n>In December 2001, Enron filed what was then the largest corporate bankruptcy in American history. Just weeks later, Mr. Mueller, then the F.B.I. director; Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson; and the assistant attorney general for the criminal division, Michael Chertoff, formed the Enron Task Force, an elite team of F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors assigned to investigate and prosecute crimes related to the Houston-based energy trader. Andrew Weissmann, who recently joined Mr. Mueller’s Russia team, later led the task force.\n\n[...]\n\n>The Enron team got off to an auspicious start, with the Department of Justice providing adequate prosecutorial resources. Mr. Mueller helped recruit talented prosecutors and investigators from around the country and then got out of their way.\n\n>He and other top Justice Department officials then gave their team political cover. Enron and its executives were particularly close to the Bush family and top Republican officials. Early on, the team interviewed White House officials about their recollections. Republican political operatives voiced displeasure, but the team persisted.\n\n>The task force conducted its investigations effectively, flipping lower-level employees to build cases against the top bad actors. The Enron team made aggressive and risky moves. For example, it shocked Houston high society by charging the wife of Andrew Fastow, the chief financial officer, with tax evasion to put pressure on him. It worked. Mr. Fastow began to cooperate with the government. (His wife pleaded guilty.) Every prosecutor knows this strategy works, but for various reasons today, few put in the painstaking work needed to penetrate the sophisticated legal defenses of highly paid executives.\n\nThe last paragraph is exactly the strategy that the current special counsel is employing in regards to the Russia investigation. Obviously there haven't been any wives charged (yet) but I wouldn't be surprised if Mueller targeted family members who were complicit in these crimes."
"He was a great Tillerson, but even as he did that I still thought he looked more like Bannon.  But I still stand by Galifianakis as the perfect Bannon.  I think he'd knock it outta the park.

"I never said it was Mueller's greatest accomplishment. It's just the one I see referenced first in most articles that talk about his track record."
">Being the director doesn't inherently require their involvement in big cases.\n\nYou're right, but it's pretty commonly reported that he was deeply involved."
"It doesn't poll well.  From what I've heard, this is a losing strategy.  If democrats make it about impeachment, they lose.  If they make it about healthcare, education and the economy, they win.  People what to hear about what were for, not what were against.  \n\nWhich I understand to a point.  The Russia investigation and all of the other scandals don't affect my day to day life.  But, affordable healthcare and college does.  However, it will affect my day to day life in the future if we allow this level of corruption to continue.  Unfortunately Americans tend to want everything fast, and have short attention spans.  We only care about now, nevermind later.\n\nI think the strategy needs to be to call out corruption, but make sure we run on making life better for all Americans.  "
"Hey to be fair.... he's a slumlord so it actually checks out. There's a good chance Cohen explained llcs and the shady business practices he was involved with.  That's not exactly the best defense but hey he's more honest than Cohen's other two clients. By a very small margin."
"I agree.   There is some shady stuff going on with these three.   It's just a question of how long it takes to root it out.\n\nI would absolutely LOVE it if Hannity were involved in collusion though.  Nothing would be better than to see him stripped of the millions he made lying to the American public and foisting a turd like Trump on us."
"Regardless of Trump's tantrums, Mueller just plain deserves it. Whatever comes out of the investigation, he's undeniably a symbol of hope for a lot of America. An absurdly competent investigator and his crack team making sure the law is upheld, he's a strong symbol of justice in trying times where there's otherwise little hope that the righteous thing will happen. We now expect terrible people in power to get away scot-free, but in this case, he'll hold them to the same standard of law we all live under."

'"Microtargeting" of content is really interesting. Because [Robert Mercer](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/27/the-reclusive-hedge-fund-tycoon-behind-the-trump-presidency), the billionaire hedgefund guy behind Trump, is the main investor in Cambridge Analytica - a company that specializes in exactly that. It\'s parent company is [SCL Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica) (Strategic Communication Laboratories) which has been described as a "global election management agency" known for involvement "in military disinformation campaigns to social media branding and voter targeting". In short, **they specialize in military propaganda or ‘psyops’**. \n\n*Cambridge Analytica* was brought in by Mercer to help Trump win. \n\n>Cambridge Analytica:  The company claims to use “data enhancement and audience segmentation techniques” providing “psychographic analysis” for a “deeper knowledge of the target audience”. The company uses the OCEAN scale of personality traits. Using what it calls **"behavioral microtargeting"** the company indicates that it can predict "needs" of subjects and how these needs may change over time. Services then can be individually targeted for the benefit of its clients from the political arena, governments, and companies providing "a better and more actionable view of their key audiences." \n\nCombining data and content obtained through nefarious means (hacking) with sophisticated software and targeting to maximize its effectiveness is evil genius. All the pieces are coming together now. What is becoming much clearer now is that Trump\'s victory was no bumbling accident. \n\nInterestingly, Cambridge Analytica\'s software is based on models developed by Cambridge academic Michal Kosinski - he didn\'t want to have anything to do with the company. The guy that first approached Kosinski was Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian. It was Kogan that apparently introduced SCL to Kosinki\'s models. Kogan then moved to Singapore and changed his name to [Alexander Spectre](http://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/people/ak823@cam.ac.uk). Was he working for Russian Intelligence? **Given the key role Cambridge Analytica and SCL played in the US election (and in Brexit), it would be good to know who exactly is behind them.** \n\n> Who exactly owns SCL and its diverse branches is unclear, thanks to a convoluted corporate structure, the type seen in the UK Companies House, the Panama Papers, and the Delaware company registry. Some of the SCL offshoots have been involved in elections from Ukraine to Nigeria, helped the Nepalese monarch against the rebels, whereas others have developed methods to influence Eastern European and Afghan citizens for NATO. And, in 2013, SCL spun off a new company to participate in US elections: Cambridge Analytica.\n\nIt gets more interesting. The largest shareholder of SCL was on record as being Vincent Tchenguiz, an Iranian-British businessman.  Tchenguiz is a business partner with Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash,  who is known as a Putin protégé. Tchenguiz used the same Guernsey holding company, Wheddon Ltd., to invest both in Cambridge Analytica’s parent company and in another privately held U.K. business whose largest shareholder was the Ukrainian gas middleman [Dmitry Firtash](http://www.reuters.com/article/russia-capitalism-gas-special-report-pix-idUSL3N0TF4QD20141126) - a close friend of Putin who is [currently indicted](http://abc7chicago.com/news/ukrainian-oligarchs-extradition-to-chicago-on-hold/1768041/) and awaiting extradition on corruption and racketeering charges.\n\n> Over the same time period, other documents show, bankers close to Putin granted Firtash credit lines of up to $11 billion. That credit helped Firtash, who backed pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovich\'s successful 2010 bid to become Ukraine\'s president, to buy a dominant position in the country\'s chemical and fertiliser industry and expand his influence.\n\nAnd guess who was Dmitry Firtash\'s former business partner? [Paul Manafort](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-campaign-chief-paul-manafort-named-in-ukraine-anti-corruption-probe/2016/08/15/fa180f20-6327-11e6-be4e-23fc4d4d12b4_story.html) - Trump\'s former campaign manager. Manafort of course worked directly for Yanukovych and [Firtash](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/21/austria-grants-us-request-to-extradite-ukrainian-mogul-dmytro-firtash) was the middleman between Putin and the Yanukovych electoral operation in Ukraine.\n\nSo the largest shareholder of Cambridge Analytica is a business partner with Firtash, who has direct ties with Putin. Firtash is known to operate as a financing middleman for Putin\'s foreign policy "operations". Could SCL, parent of CA, be a front for a Russian Intelligence operation? If you think about it, SCL specializes in new sophisticated technology models for military propaganda. If you read up on new Russian military doctrine, it\'s clear they are placing a big emphasis on information warfare. The [\'Gerasimov Doctrine’](https://inmoscowsshadows.wordpress.com/2014/07/06/the-gerasimov-doctrine-and-russian-non-linear-war/) is quite insightful about how Russia views defeating their enemies:\n\n> The role of nonmilitary means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown, and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their effectiveness....All this is supplemented by military means of a concealed character, including carrying out actions of informational conflict.\n\n> Among such actions are the use of special-operations forces and *internal opposition* to create a permanently operating front through the entire territory of the enemy state, as well as informational actions, devices, and means that are constantly being perfected.\n\nDid Russia view Bannon/Trump and co as the perfect vehicles to ferment and support "internal opposition"? Was Cambridge Analytica one of the vehicles to achieve this and to help execute their ideas around information warfare?\n\nGuess who a Board Member of Cambridge Analytica was? **Steve Bannon.** And it was Robert Mercer that [bankrolled Steve Bannon](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/robert-mercer-breitbart-war-on-media-steve-bannon-donald-trump-nigel-farage) and Breitbart to the tune of $10 million - no doubt to be the front-facing tool to execute on their ideas around influence, manipulation and propaganda. \n\nAnd with the help of Russian Intelligence, it is entirely plausible Breitbart was involved in using bots and social media to help propagate news they knew would damage Hillary and help Trump. \n\nThere are very clear and direct ties between powerful Russian/Ukrainian figures and Cambridge Analytica - which specializes in military propaganda. Steve Bannon was a board member and Robert Mercer was its biggest investor. And of course Mercer, Banner, Cambridge Analytica and Brieitbart all played a key roll in helping Trump get elected. It\'s not a big stretch to suggest that there was cooperation and collusion with Russian Intelligence, who provided hacked data to Cambridge Analytica, who then used it to carry out a sophisticated propaganda campaign, with Breitbart as the lead. \n\n[Cambridge Analytica also played a key role in BREXIT - offering Firage and the Leave campaign their services *for free*](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/robert-mercer-brexit-nigel-farage-donald-trump-breitbart-facebook-advertisement-cambridge-analytica-a7600041.html). \n\n>The firm is said to have advised Leave.eu by harvesting data from people\'s Facebook profiles to decide how to target them with individualised advertisements.  \n\n\nBrexit was of course seen as a big geopolitical strategic win for Putin and Russia.\n\nAnother interesting bit of info that is a bit tenuous but nonetheless intriguing - the largest shareholder of SCL Group was Vincent Tchenguiz. \n\n> In March 2011 the Tchenguiz brothers were arrested in dramatic predawn raids as part of an investigation into the 2008 collapse of the Icelandic bank Kaupthing. Just before its collapse, Kaupthing’s loans to the Tchenguiz brothers totaled 40 percent of its capital. It has been charged that Kaupthing—which had a far-from-transparent ownership structure—was effectively the Tchenguiz brothers’ bank and that they looted the bank, leading to its collapse.\n\n> Kaupthing’s largest shareholder, Meidur, now called Exista, which owned 25 percent of its shares, [had ties to Alfa Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exista), the largest Russian commercial bank; Alfa chairman was “deep state” figure Mikhail Fridman, chairman and co-founder of Alfa Group, the parent of Alfa Bank. Meanwhile, Trump adviser Richard Burt (who also was being paid by Russia to promote a Gazprom pipeline) is on the “senior advisory board” of Alfa Bank. \n\nWas this how Russian intelligence bankrolled SCL in the early days? Perhaps Vincent Tchenguiz was the cutout man, and funds were channeled from Alfa Bank into Kaupthing and on to Vincent Tchenguiz. Russian Intelligence seems to work well with ambitious businessman who are happy to be corrupted if they can make some money. Trump also seemed to fit this bill. \n\n*Alfa Bank was the bank that a Trump Server was mysteriously communicating with and was likely the subject of an FBI surveillance warrant.*  '
'It\'s important to understand the specific nature of legal wording/phrasing.\n\nWhere the language of a Mueller indictment might say the "voting outcome" was not affected by the hacks is to say that the hackers did not alter voting records. This is correct.\n\nHowever, this purposely doesn\'t comment on the indirect effect that entities, including but not limited to the GRU, had on influencing the actual voting outcome.\n\nThere are several reasons to make this distinction, but the legal reason for it is to avoid hanging a legal argument on tenuous threads.  Each of Mueller\'s indictments is compartmented, narrow, specific.... so as to increase the likelihood of securing the Grand Jury conviction.  The FBI has a near 100&#37; conviction rate and they like to keep it that way.  And to that point, the charges made are Conspiracy to Defraud the U.S. (18 USC §371), computer fraud (18 USC §1030), and aggravated identity theft (18 USC §1028A).\n\nAnother consideration reinforced by the legal analysts at Lawfareblog: There is almost no likelihood of extradition for the 12 GRU officers... they will never leave Russia or be extradited by Russia to the U.S.  So, the purpose of the indictment, other than laying groundwork for other indictments and freezing Russian assets in the United States, is to let the American people know.  And in that sense, every word or phrase is chosen carefully.\n\nThe indictment clearly tells us that the vote counts were not changed (which is, again, completely correct), but it clearly excludes any kind of conclusion that the actual votes made were not *influenced*... that was the entire intent of the Russian effort from paragraph one of the indictment.'
'**Cambridge Analytica**\n\nCambridge Analytica Ltd (CA) was a British political consulting firm which combined data mining, data brokerage, and data analysis with strategic communication during the electoral processes. It was started in 2013 as an offshoot of the SCL Group. The company was partly owned by the family of Robert Mercer, an American hedge-fund manager who supports many politically conservative causes. The firm maintained offices in London, New York City, and Washington, DC. CEO Alexander Nix has said CA was involved in 44 US political races in 2014.\n\n***\n\n**Exista**\n\nExista hf. is an Icelandic financial services group formerly listed on the Iceland Stock Exchange.

I want his work to bring justice, its just troubling that theres so much info coming out on who he’s going after that i cant help but think that a) news is getting out that he doesnt want out or b) these posts are misinformation by t_d to get you guys all huffy and guffy while they laugh in their sub'

'First a positive: you have a fantastic username from a tremendous movie. But you mention some facts, so I\'ll counter your statements with some additional ones. \n\n1. First, this isn\'t an indictment, it\'s a statement of offense. And these aren\'t \'charges\', Papadapoulos signed a plea deal for a single \'violation\', false statements. Are the three \'charges\' you are referring to different incidents of communicating with Russians? This implicates himself and himself only. Because collusion... (continued)\n\n2. ...isn\'t actually a crime (except in antitrust). That\'s why he didn\'t sign a plea deal for collusion, he signed one for lying. You can think it\'s shady, and you\'re entitled to. You can think the same about Donald Junior for taking a meeting with somebody claiming to rep the Russian Govt and having dirt on Hillary. But the bottom line is that communicating with other countries and seeking \'opposition research\' isn\'t illegal and is standard practice in US political campaigns. It happened on both sides in this election, and I can provide examples if you\'d like. I won\'t go into Hillary\'s current issues, but she did once say "I am already receiving messages from leaders, and I am having foreign leaders ask if they can endorse me to stop Donald Trump". And the US is no stranger to trying to influence foreign elections. There are a number of things that could be actual violations across election law, computer hacking, false statements, and wire fraud, but most are quite separate from collusion. \n\n3. People on both sides have chosen who they support, and hope for the eventual outcome of this, and other topics, to support their side. We\'re all guilty of confirmation bias and seeking validation of our beliefs. And both sides are passionate about their beliefs, and claim the other side doesn\'t doesn\'t believe facts. We all cherry pick the ones that support our views. An informed individual can address the "facts" that both support and counter their views (not meant as a dig, just something for all of us to strive for). \n\nCheers.'
'Ever notice how when Trump and his team do, let\'s call it "opposition research", you hear words like "met with" or "had contact with". That is perfectly legal. \n\nWhen the democrats do opposition research it\'s "here\'s $40,000, tell me what I need to know or give me \'evidence\' that I can say I didn\'t know was fake" '

'There is no personality cult for Podesta. People here don\'t give a fuck which party Podesta is part of, if he was breaking the law, then fuck him, we want him punished.\n\nSame thing happened with Weinstein turning out to be a sex offender. The right tried to "checkmate, liberals" but the left wasn\'t in his corner. Nobody gives a fuck that he voted for democrats and gave money to liberal causes. He\'s now considered a criminal, a traitor, a monster, and no one on the left has any excuses to make for him or wants anything to do with him.\n\nAnd that\'s exactly what *will not* happen to Trump on the right. That\'s what we\'re all upset about. It\'s like the right is cheering for a favorite sports team or something, and just wants their guy to win no matter what. It seems most people on the right don\'t mind if their values are upheld or not, they aren\'t worried about the integrity of government officials, they just want Team Red to win, at any and all costs. Otherwise why do they stick up for frauds? The party won\'t end if they take a break to find new leaders. Why not find a new face for their movement? Because it\'s just about "fuck the libtards, look we\'re winning!" No concern for integrity at all.'
'lol i like that '

'Lol. You already have it all figured out but since you asked...\n\nYou probably know that there is no crime called “collusion.” So an example of a crime he could’ve been charged with is:\n\n52 U.S. Code § 30121 - Contributions and donations by foreign nationals\n\n(a) ProhibitionIt shall be unlawful for—\n(1) a foreign national, directly or indirectly, to make—\n(A) a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value, or to make an express or implied promise to make a contribution or donation, in connection with a Federal, State, or local election;\n(B) a contribution or donation to a committee of a political party; or\n(C) an expenditure, independent expenditure, or disbursement for an electioneering communication (within the meaning of section 30104(f)(3) of this title); or\n(2) a person to solicit, accept, or receive a contribution or donation described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) from a foreign national.\n(b) “Foreign national” definedAs used in this section, the term “foreign national” means—\n(1) a foreign principal, as such term is defined by section 611(b) of title 22, except that the term “foreign national” shall not include any individual who is a citizen of the United States; or\n(2) an individual who is not a citizen of the United States or a national of the United States (as defined in section 1101(a)(22) of title 8) and who is not lawfully admitted for permanent residence, as defined by section 1101(a)(20) of title 8.\n\nA key point point to the law above is that SOLICITATION is enough to be a crime. He did not have to actually receive  material.\n\nGeorge solicited valuable information (emails) from a foreign national as well as secretly tried to setup meetings with foreign nationals tied to Russia.\n\nThat is collusion.\n\nStay with me because this is where it gets really bad for you Trump humpers:\n\nGeorge took a plea deal. Which means FBI offered a light sentence in order for his cooperation otherwise known as “flipping” to go after larger suspects.\n\nBombshell: He is listed on court documents as a “proactive cooperator”.....aka an informant.\nT\nHe was charged 3 months ago, that means for the past 3 months his charges have been kept secret and he has been cooperating with Mueller.\n\nI’ll let you make up your own theories on what that means.\n\n'
'100% disagree. I know that the_donald subreddit is bashed no matter what, and that\'s fine. A lot of what you read there is ridiculous. But if you actually read a lot of the posts there (and from a lot of the journalists that like Trump) you\'d see that what you said and what I say are very aligned. Establishment left AND right are bullshit. That is one thing that bernie as well as trump both deserve credit for in 2016. They were the first 2 that stood up to "politics as usual". Granted, bernie got steamrolled by the hillary goliath, but that is where trump is different. I am pretty sure establishment GOP wants trump impeached every bit as much as establishment left, to keep their corrupt system in place. I couldn\'t care less what party they are in, mitch mcconnell, paul ryan, mccain, bush, hillary, obama, they\'re all corrupt to the core. They were brought up in the shitstorm of corruption and played right into it. True outsiders (trump, mark cuban?) have the best chance at destroying it from within. The media and most senior members of both parties will do whatever they can to destroy any outside influence. Trump has a VERY loyal following specifically because his agenda is to "drain the swamp" meaning BOTH parties. I\'m excited to see how 2018 plays out, because the "establishment as usual" GOP crowd is shaking in their boots. Trump could literally say he\'s leaving the GOP today and being an independent candidate and he\'d have at least 50% of the GOP follow him regardless of party affiliation. Ever since the election when I saw how dirty the GOP is there\'s no chance in hell I will ever give the GOP another dime of my money. The left and right will bash each other in front of the camera, but it is all bullshit. Establishment vs. Outsiders/independents are what the future of elections are going to be. We\'re very likely to see a legit contender in 2020 that is socially liberal (within reason) and fiscally conservative AND not part of the washington corruption, and have them win the presidency. Young people are not like our parents. We aren\'t just going to put on CNN or Fox every day and blindly follow whatever we hear. People do their own research now and actually understand politics. I\'d say there are about 25% of people that are so far left on this site that they wouldn\'t even entertain a conversation related to somoene else\'s belief systems and call me a "cheeto or trumpster or drumpf, etc" and 25% of the right do the same "snowflake, libtard, etc." but there are a reasonable amount of people that can have a good conversation about politics and make for an interesting conversation. Once you sift through the muck that is biased media and actually read the facts on your own (like the 12 indictments), I for one generally say "interesting, that is definitely not what i heard on CNN or fox" and just draw my own conclusions. \n\nIf you\'re a criminal, right or left, you need to be punished for it. nobody would be cheering for manafort and his tax evading, money laundering, shady deal ways no matter who he worked for or what party he aligned himself with.

'That the witch hunt continues. That\'s what it means, because they\'ll find nothing. The Russian collusion lie has been proven to be that since the beginning. You have nothing. And the best part is the Russian collusion lie is a boomerang that hit nothing on the way out but is now smacking the left square in the face upon its return. \n\nThis is another "bombshell" that will prove to be anything but yet again. Enjoy it while it lasts I guess, if it helps you sleep at night after being triggered all day. \n\n'

"Whoaaaa, so many good points backed up by factual evidence!\n\nI'll have to rethink my position. Lmao"
'Russia stands to gain an absolute shitload in return in the long term.\n\n- Increased division among Americans over political and racial lines, and increased general distrust for politicians and political office.\n\n- The continued dissemination of propaganda and "fake news" over the internet by Russia, as described in the book Foundations of geopolitics by Aleksadr Dugin, acting to increase distrust of mainstream news organisations and leading many people to simply not believe anything those news organisations say.\n\n- America\'s image on the world stage tarnished by having a man from the TV, commonly perceived worldwide as an utter fucking buffoon, elected to the presidency.\n\n- The perception of America being considered weakened (and the clear division, instability, and strife within the country) weakens not only the US on the world stage, but also NATO given that USA is the largest and most powerful country in the organisation. (not to mention Trumps dislike NATO and questioning of USA\'s continued involvement as clearly opined on numerous occasions).\n\n- Russia\'s suspected influence on destabilizing forces within the EU, weakening The EU as an economic and political union, is obviously to Russia\'s benefit as they\'re a massive competitor in the world as well as a neighbouring power.\n\nAll of those factors together, decreases Russia\'s "competition" on the world stage. I mean, Russian has already conquered Abkhasia and South Ossettia in 2008, and part of crimea in 2014. \n\nShould the things predicted in Dugins Foundations of Geopolitics come to pass (and it looks like everything is going more or less as predicted), USA and EU would be too troubled by internal strife possibly intervene in any attempt by Russia to further conquer their way around Europe then Asia in a manner that the soviets could have only wished for.\n\nThe only difference is now the people benefiting from this conquering aren\'t the communist parties, they\'re the Russian Oligarchy (many of whom are suspected of being involved in funding what\'s happening, from trumps campaign, to the destabilizing propaganda being fostered online).\n\nShould this all come to pass Russia will once again be a (or maybe THE) major power on the world stage, and largely dictate world politics for many generations.'
"I dont think trump had anything to do with this particular situation. Perhaps something else sure. But this indictment was mostly pre-2014. But I think its terrible these shady characters were hired and potentially not vetted at all or else this woukd have to come up. I dont think it says he's qualified or not because we dont know the facts yet. Hillary and obama had a potentially very shady uranium deal (with many others involved and other agencies). Including $10 million + going unaccounted for towards fusion GPS. Corrupt? Possibly. Did she know? Possibly. Does it make her unqualified to be president? Not at all. Shes still very qualified to run the country, corrupt or not knowing anything about these dealings at all. \n\nIf a true investigation leads to the oval office and trump is found guilty in a court of law then of course oust him. And I'm a big supporter of his. But when it comes to doing illegal acts its black and white to me. But that has to go both ways. If the uranium one deal goes all the way up to hillary and obama the same rules must apply. Its black and white. Shouldn't be partisan at all. And I hope that if nobody gets in trouble ultimately in high office that going forward both parties are more aware of holding each other accountable. It will ultimately be a win for everyone going forward that more eyes are on these dealings. "

This was the one chance to show him that someone cares about his story line, consistency and contribution to the overall way this investigation has conducted itself.  \n\nHow great would this article have been if they had shown this subreddit to the Mueller team and asked for a comment on it?  "The Mueller Team spokesperson declined to comment."  This would have made the article 10x better!\n\nEdit: Peter Carr.  We hear you!'

"This weekend I decided to re-read George Washington's farewell address. He expressly warned us against the very behavior that the Republicans now display.\n\n> The very idea of the power and the right of the people to establish government presupposes the duty of every individual to obey the established government. All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and associations, under whatever plausible character, with the real design to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put, in the place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community [...] \n\n> However combinations or associations of the above description may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time and things, to become **potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.**\n\n[...]\n\n> The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of public liberty.\n\n> Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight), the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\n\n> It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. **It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another.**\n\n[...]\n\n> In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and affectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and lasting impression I could wish; that they will control the usual current of the passions, or prevent our nation from running the course which has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But, if I may even flatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, some occasional good; **that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign intrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism**; this hope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare, by which they have been dictated."

"This seems calculated (in as much as anything can be calculated with Trump). If he claims Cohen didn't represent him in the Daniels stuff, then attorney-client privilege wouldn't apply to any of that material.  They're trying to strenghten the ACP claim, not weaken it.\n\nOf course, none of that changes the fact that ACP doesn't cover criminal conspiracy, but baby steps."

'There must be a motivating factor for Trump to do this after denying it from the start and it is really fun to speculate.  Trump\'s denial of this made no sense from the start but he still proceeded to deny anyway, so what changed?\n\nTo Trump, he likely finds it plausible to deny while acting differently in the courts.  Then he can simply call "FAKE NEWS, MAGA" on any who reports on it.  After denying the affair and by inference he denied the possibility that Stormy Daniels could have any material to to prove this \\- he entered as a damaged party regarding the NDA that Stormy "breached" meaning that there is an admission that at a minimum the facts as stated in the NDA \\(including that Stormy has materials and proof\\) are in fact true and "DD" is indeed Trump.  All the while he still calls it fake news when anyone reports this.\n\nTo have this shift and to publicly claim otherwise in the public \\- something unexpected and very motivating must be in play.  \n\nThe best guess floating around it seems is that it relates to Cohen\'s legal troubles in his criminal suit.  Remember, Cohen claimed to only have a few clients he does "legal work" for.  Cohen is arguing for documents to remain under the protection of client/attorney privilege and that there is a ton of documents that are privileged.  \n\nYet, two of the three clients he claimed to do legal work for have been claiming Cohen barely did any actual legal work for them basically throwing Cohen under a large bus .  How could there be a ton of legal documents that should be protected when 2 out of 3 clients claim that there was basically a minimal amount of legal services from Cohen being provided? \n\nTrump may be trying to assert to the court that Cohen indeed was representing him legally and trying to make the point that indeed there are protected documents \\(if Trump claimed Cohen did nothing legally for him, then Cohen can\'t make a claim of attorney/client privilege\\).  Alternatively, Trump could be doing this in order to stay on Cohen\'s good side.  Who knows how loyal Cohen will be when/if the chips fall?  This could be a self preservation move to help Cohen and in turn hopefully keep his loyalty.'
"I dont know about you but i realized i have to be bipartisan always. It just so happens for a long time now the issues i hold with high importance seem to only have democrats with good ideas. Before trump i wanted similar to you, in hopes that the GOP would finally come up with realistic policy, a candidate with some fresh ideas... trump is not what i had in mind. The GOP is owned by corporate sponsors and should not be looked at as anything other then an extension of corporate America. Look at the legislation they pass, you will be hard pressed to come up with anything the will help the improve lives of Americans. They can't all be owned or controlled... but the way the GOP votes makes you wonder how they do that.   "

'The day Trump went on his first foreign trip was the same day that news dropped about him blabbing code word intel in the Oval Office to Lavrov and Kislyak during their unannounced trip to said office (that trip was picked up by American media when Russian media reported it.).  I imagined Air Force One touching down in Saudi Arabia, and Trump becoming enchanted with the chintzy, gilded city filled with people not asking him hard questions.  He could convert to Wahabbism, live in the goldest apartment he’d ever seen, and leave his American shitshow behind forever.  That was his best case scenario.'
'Good lord! Thanks for the recommendation.'
"If he's innocent, the best thing to do is shut his mouth and let the investigation show him to be innocent. Him and his supporters could slap the entire Democratic party with their balls and they wouldn't be able to do a thing about if. If he is shown to be innocent that is."
"Right now what's the best action for concerned citizens? Getting ready to protest?"

'In a normal situation, the Attorney General, which is currently Jeff Sessions.

"I would think all of those options and more are on the table. I'd expect the firings for sure. \nAttacks on Syria, since his first target of choice pulled his card and said they'd denuclearize. (Lol first human in history to get outsmarted by KimJongUn). \n  Lots of bluster and threats, probably a skirmish with Russia...actually maybe now that I think of it, he probably thinks that if the crisis were big enough, he could declare martial law and stop worrying about having to pretend to follow the rule of law.  I'm not sure on the legalities of that, but he's a slightly below average intelligence, wannabe goon, so he might hunk that's his last angle.  \n  Honestly, who fucking knows anymore, right? 18 months ago I'd have laughed at myself for even thinking something like this is possible. Especially after having such a good, honorable, noble man like President Obama leading the way for 8 years. But now, pretty much anything is on the table.  \n  As much as I dislike prepping et al, the only thing I can think to do anymore is have some supplies on hand and keep an extra good eye on my family until whatever it is that's going to happen happens. "

"Yup. Been trying to tell my liberal friends this. They are so confident in Democrats winning the House and Senate in 2018 and then impeaching that they are missing what is going to be a very difficult election.\n\n\n\nThe Democrats have something like 27 Senate seats up for re-election this cycle while Republicans have only about 8. Of those 27 Democrats, **a lot** are in deep red states. Indiana, West Virginia, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota and a whole slew of other states that aren't red, but where Trump won like Wisconsin, Ohio, Florida. On the flip side, the **only** state that Clinton won with a Republican seat up for election is Nevada, which has been trending more and more red in national elections. Obama won Nevada by double digits in 2008, single digits in 2012, and Clinton squeaked out a victory there in 2016.\n\n\n\nEven if the Democrats manage to hold every single seat they currently hold **and** flip **all** of the Republican seats, they would only end up with 56 + 2 independents who usually caucus with Democrats. A 2/3 majority in the Senate is required to convict on impeachment, so 67. Democrats would have to vote completely in unison and get 11 Republicans to vote to remove the President from office for the first time in our country's history, a huge stain on the party.\n\n\n\nImpeachment is not happening. Need to focus on 2020, let Mueller conclude his investigation, and try and win in 2020."
"Best case scenario, 11 R's would have to vote to remove him from office. I don't see that happening, though I sure wouldn't mind it. And yes, voting is extremely important, more so than at any time in my memory. I'm just saying the focus shouldn't be on impeachment as it's a *very* long shot."

"One person and he did it to protect the integrity of the investigation while removing a person who was not behaving impartially.  The last laugh will be Mueller's.  He's a dedicated servant to this country and has been for about 5 decades now.  He's the catalyst of sweet bleach justice for this shit stained fat draft dodger conman you call a President."

"Very good points and i agree with you whole heartedly about us having a hand in creating (and hopefully helping to fix) this mess. But he definetely knew let's not pretend he didn't. Just another example of this administration misleading the public. "
'The Middle East is a very complex situation that\'s been around for ages. One man is not going to fix it. What he is doing is just causing more instability in the region. And one more point, even if he was tasked with "fixing the middle east" the way he is going about it ie; behind the backs of the intelligence community and others, is not the way to accomplish peace in the Middle East.'
'Makes me happy too. The nature of this sub is sort of an echo chamber, so this is nice to see. '
'That said, the 20th century order caused much of the instability. Jews, Coptic Christians and Muslims lived side by side for centuries prior to colonialism in places like Palestine (now mostly Isreal) and Egypt. \n\nThe British and French just drew borders on convenience, the British engineered the seething mass that was Mandatory Palestine, and the US used its economic might to force through the UN resolution leading to the State of Israel.\n\nIMO - if we (collective) had a hand in breaking it, we have a certain responsibility to help fix it (productively - not the Kushner way)'
"Always good advice.  Mueller keeps it **CRIMINAL** though, and I'm more than fine with that."
'Absolute not, he knew it was his ass if the truth came out, but you\'re right in that he was so stupid that he fired Comey and actually thought that would end it all and he was safe.\nTrump was a private citizen all his life and did not know thing one about public service and the expectations when given the responsibility. There was little doubt in his mind that he could bring in people to cover his back, like Sen Sessions, who unlike Trump was elected to office and knew the routine. Sessions chose the Sgt Shultz defense of "I see nothing,..nothing" and quickly disentangled himself with a recusal.\n\nNo, trump knew he conspired with those who suggested a covert operation WITH the Russians to help him win and knew there is always a payback.\n\nAnd I am also sure that Trump never envisioned that there would be such a reaction to all this, as this campaign  was just like he did business all these years, made himself wealthy and thought it could all be applied to his new job and work just as well.\n\nHe made a **huge miscalculation** and now the walls are closing in and he thinks some *miraculous* foreign policy achievement, or a massive growth in the economy or a large change in direction of our society would somehow save his ass.\n\nThat is what he thinks and he is dead wrong.'

'only trump can keep digging himself deeper with every daily tweet. it truly is a magnificent show of ignorance on a level of which we have never seen before. '
'He needs to be loved by his fans though. He floats all his ideas to them to see if he will get support. Unless he personally benefits financially, he doesn’t make actual decisions on things.

'Sessions is too occupied with fears that the kids will get his Lucky Charms to pay attention to stuff like this.'
'He did and the top response I see to Trump is exactly that. Trump has not taken any punitive action toward Putin or Russia despite repeated warnings from the Intelligence community in a pattern that mirrors the repeated warnings about impending al Qaeda action preceding the World Trade Center attack.'

"This is all new in the grand scheme of things and the public still doesn't know all that's happened yet, but you best believe anyone staying on the GOP-ship after this is a dirty fucking traitor."
'In a two-party system, you\'re either with the republicans or against them. There\'s no "alternative republican" party with saner right-wing stances to compete with them (obvious Democrat jokes aside), you\'re forced to boil your beliefs down to a single global yes/no statement.\n\nAs as result, there\'s nothing for the "I\'m a republican, *but*" people to actually do, to force the republican party to improve. Not unless they want democrats to win, in which case they have the same problem as the "I\'m a democrat, *but*" people.'
"On the other hand, here in the Netherlands we have many parties representing us. It is not hard to find a party which you support, but the impact is marginal. We have 150 seats and need 76 seats atleast to have a coalition. The problem is, when you have many parties, it may require 2 parties to achieve a coalition of 76+ seats (like we had previously) or now 4 parties.\n\nThe problem? Well, the combination involves four different parties with different views. They all have to make so many comprimises that it didn't really mattet after all who you voted for, as the end result is just a comprised bunch of ideas that are just an average and doesn't result in any real actions. Very little changes and it takes a while for something to change.\n\nBottom line: sure, it is not good to have so little options. But although it might be better to have more options to choose from, it is not the ideal situation. We need to rethink the way our political system is shaped. Have a look at Switzerland for example, where many refenderums are taken and the politicians have a supporting role (i.e. implementing the results of the refenderums) instead of a representative role. There are many forms and there may not be a perfect solution that fits each country, but the current state of the system is not sustainable."

I can\'t unpack all of this during a work day but I first heard this guy\'s name 20 mins ago and since then I\'ve read Rosneft, sanctions and Putin multiple times.\n\nHere\'s a nice nugget from Wikipedia on one of his deals:\n\n>Despite this, the L1 purchase of RWE DEA was opposed by\xa0UK Energy and Climate Change Secretary\xa0Ed Davey, who "raised concerns" that sanctions[36]\xa0might "force L1 Energy [Khan\'s company] to shut down production in the North Sea, imperiling oil supplies"[42]\xa0and 5% of Britain\'s North Sea natural gas output.[43]\n'

'The article does mention that some of these cyber experts ave connections to "3 letter agencies" and security firms/private contractors (who also have connections to 3 letter agencies.) However, the article says this particular discovery was found by chance...\n\nIn late July, one of these scientists—who asked to be referred to as Tea Leaves, a pseudonym that would protect his relationship with the networks and banks that employ him to sift their data—found what looked like malware emanating from Russia. The destination domain had Trump in its name, which of course attracted Tea Leaves’ attention. But his discovery of the data was pure happenstance—a surprising needle in a large haystack of DNS lookups on his screen. “I have an outlier here that connects to Russia in a strange way,” he wrote in his notes. He couldn’t quite figure it out at first. But what he saw was a bank in Moscow that kept irregularly pinging a server registered to the Trump Organization on Fifth Avenue."\n\nlink to article (which is a year old)\n\nhttp://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html'
'Slate\'s sources apparently had access to DNS logs. The records of DNS lookups aren\'t public, but they\'re not exactly closely-guarded secrets. Here\'s an analogy:\n\nLet\'s say Alice wants to call her friend Bob at work, but she doesn\'t know his extension. Alice does know the number for Carol at the front desk, so she calls and asks for Bob\'s extension. Carol tells Alice the extension, and Alice calls Bob. \n\nNow imagine Carol keeps a notebook containing the number of every outside caller who asks for an employee, which employee they\'re asking for, and the time of the call. Carol never knows if Alice ends up calling Bob or what the two talk about, but she does has a record of Alice asking for Bob\'s extension.\n\nAlfa Bank is Alice. The server associated with Trump is Bob. Carol is the DNS server, and her "notebook" is what Slate\'s sources were looking at. '
"Thanks, Ive read them though.  I think I may ave posted them on here somewhere as well.  I found it to be very interesting because the article quoted several cyber security experts that all believed this was a secret connection for communication between the two organizations.  The experts said that this is the was two servers would be set up for secret communications between two criinal organizations.  I feel as though this, and the dutch intelligience regarding Cozy Bear will be the smoking gun in this whole thing.   My opinion, and Im sure others have thought the same is that the main connection is between cambridge analytica performing the data analysis to determine which people and markets the russian troll farm should focus their mesege.  CA had a satellite office in LA in te same building a Bannon's A/V prodction company.  "
'I dont have any subject matter knowledge, but what I found particulary interesting is that after te NYT\'s began asking questions to the WH, the initial campaign server name was terminated, and a new name was implemented.  \n\n"Four days later, on Sept. 27, the Trump Organization created a new host name, trump1.contact-client.com, which enabled communication to the very same server via a different route. When a new host name is created, the first communication with it is never random. To reach the server after the resetting of the host name, the sender of the first inbound mail has to first learn of the name somehow. It’s simply impossible to randomly reach a renamed server. “That party had to have some kind of outbound message through SMS, phone, or some noninternet channel they used to communicate [the new configuration],” Paul Vixie told me. The first attempt to look up the revised host name came from Alfa Bank. “If this was a public server, we would have seen other traces,” Vixie says. “The only look-ups came from this particular source.”'
"Honestly we all need to be educating Fox News viewers with FACTS through Fox News' social media pages like Facebook and Twitter!!!! Trump has to be stopped!!! It's Fox News who is responsible for spreading the brainwashing."
'Considering the investigation on Cohen and others are being handled by other parts of the DOJ/FBI/SDNY, I sure do hope Mueller is investigating things like this. It is definitely a part of Russian interference in the 2016 elections.   \n'
"I agree, and I secretly hope theyre planning/coordinating something off the radar that will be effective. I've said it before and I'll say it again: This election is FAR more important than 2020. If Dems don't get at lest the House, then you can kiss democracy goodbye."
'I absolutely appreciate what you\'re trying to achieve here. \n\nHowever, a couple things: \n\n* One, the creation of an alternate conservative reality has been ongoing since the 1960s by my best reading of things. That is, prior to the existence of Fox News. It started with conservative think tanks, spread to public radio, and really culminates with Fox News existence. It\'s the capstone to a massive pyramid of successful media influence. Or, call it what it is: propaganda. But the thing is, *it works*. It has worked for generations now. It isn\'t going anywhere any time soon, unfortunately.\n* Second, there\'s this little thing called [the backfire effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias#backfire_effect). In replicable scientific experiments, it has been shown with consistency that when you throw mountains of contradictory evidence in the face of people that have deeply held beliefs, *they reject the facts and it makes their pre-existing beliefs stronger*. This is only slightly terrifying in its ramifications. [Here](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=backfire+effect) you\'ll find more info about the backfire effect. I really like [this](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2017/01/13/yanss-093-the-neuroscience-of-changing-your-mind/) [series](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2017/01/30/yanss-094-how-motivated-skepticism-strengthens-incorrect-beliefs/) of [podcasts](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2017/02/11/yanss-095-how-to-fight-back-against-the-backfire-effect/) on the [topic](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2018/01/29/yanss-120-the-backfire-effect-part-four/).\n\nSo ... what *can* we do to create the desired change, if we\'ve been divided into tribal camps on the verge of open war with one another? Honestly, if it were easy, it\'d be done already. You\'re right, too much is at stake.  Probably the best thing you can do is not freak out. There\'s a certain part of both the left and the right that just want to get a rise out of the other side. Don\'t give them the pleasure.\n\nWhat I\'ve personally found to be effective is an appeal to a higher power. People on the right are frequently -- but not always -- religious. You don\'t grow up in \'MURICA not knowing the basics of Christianity. In personal interactions, I often just say "that doesn\'t sound very Christian" and leave it at that -- and its worked! Not always or even often, but twice! So, its *possible*.\n\nGood luck friend. I want the world to be different and better too.'
'I think a lot of Republican voters would be shocked, but also afraid. Skipping over a lot of intermediate steps, they think it would be bad of the GOP was out of power for a decade or two. Lots think Democratic policies hurt the country, others may believe there *must* be a right-wing party to counteract a left-wing party. So, find some way to convince them the Democrats would be better, and convince them that because conservative voters will still be around, they will organize under a new, untainted banner.'

"What I feel is very important that doesn't get mentioned a lot is that Fox and right wing media didn't take Bernie seriously and so never really tried to trash him like Hillary. \n\nIf Bernie had gotten the nomination, you would have heard 24/7 how he's a Jewish socialist and possibly a communist. \n\nI think that's why no Democrat has declared for 2020 yet so the GOP can't try to ruin any one candidate yet and do investigations of them. "
"Unfortunately I agree with you. He shined a bright light on what this country wants and needs though. The DNC refused to let it happen. But Bernie's legacy will be kicking the door down and allowing progressives to take root. Bernie not getting elected might have a more meaningfup and positive impact in the long run. I hope anyway."

'Eh, Trump supporters are actually a small minority of the country.

The fact that Wikileaks (a media organization) contacted the son of a Presidential candidate to try and obtain information from him or to get them to retweet some of their stories isnt a scandal, its what every single media outlet in the world does.\n\nAlso, anyone who wants to be clever and complain about "censorship" here, please learn what the term means.

'If the article is true, and it appears to be true because Don Jr. just tweeted out complete confirmation of everything (again), then this is one of the many smoking guns that are laying around in the Trump/Russia thing.  This proves that the Trump family was coordinating activities with a hostile foreign intelligence service aligned with Russia.  If this is the kind of evidence that Mueller has (it is), then a pretty strong case can be made for crimes such as Conspiracy Against The United States.  Also, from the beginning of all of this, the Intelligence Community has called the Trump/Russia thing "an **ATTACK** on our election".  This is very important, because if the American government perceives this as an act of war (it does), then any Americans that were knowingly involved in that have committed Treason.  So now we apparently have proof that the Trump family has conspired with a foreign power to commit an act of war against the United States.  Nearly the entire Trump family now has to answer for Treason.  At least, that\'s my interpretation of the facts.  Better buckle up and invest in popcorn.'

"This is an important revelation, not becasue it came to pass, but becasue for the first time we see the Trump Campaign exercising ***intent*** to seek assisatnce from a foreign power in trying to aid the campaign.

'If he finds something on him I, in turn, would love it if "you all" did the same.'
"The whole reason an investigation is ongoing is because not enough evidence has turned up to make a case. And frankly, a lot of people here are acting like it's already been decided. Which makes them disingenuous because their opinions currently have no merit. \n\nThis entire subreddit is a circlejerk about the prospect of Trump being impeached. So far it's fantasyland and it's sorry to see. "
"Correct, I don't know the inner workings of the investigation any more than you know trump is innocent.  \n\nCome find me if they never charge trump or his inner circle.  I'll fly over on my unicorn and give you and Trump my most sincere apology.  "

'Or, you know, they are giving it the care and integrity it deserves, since it’s like, the POTUS we’re talking about. Think of it like this, Hillary was investigated for 5 years and she was just a lowly Secretary of State. This is the the leader of the free world, he *deserves* the most thorough and solid investigation possible. Something like that isn’t just whipped out in 8 months. No buddy, it takes time and painstaking effort to ensure that no (roger) stone has gone unturned. We’ll still be on this during the 2024 elections.👍🏻👍🏻'
"I'm pretty sure most of the Republican party's leadership is involved, at least a couple dozen very powerful people. It took years to take down the mob, and they weren't nearly so connected as Speaker Ryan, Mitch McConnel, and the Orange shitstain."
'There needs to be intent behind it to make it a prosecutable, if that is a word, offense. I listened to Comey’s speech. I understand what he was saying. It is sketchy, but not illegal. \n\nIf an E1 at the state department or DoD working on raw intel did that, he/she would, bare minimum, lose his/her job. \n\nShe was protected by her political status as a presidential appointee. \n\nAll of that considered, I would rather have her as president over Bernie, Trump, or any of the the republican’s that ran.

'I did reply to your top level question, and you ignored it and threw a tantrum instead. Here, I\'ll repeat it for you.\n\nNo, I won\'t apologise, because these suspicions are not based on nothing.

'>You\'re an absolute liar. A quick scrolling through your post history shows 22 pro-Trump posts on the Donald in the last year and 2 on StarCraft. You\'re really gonna sit here and tell me you didn\'t vote for him? Come on man, you\'re making a fool of yourself.\n\nOkay, do you really not know how to do basic Redditing? My comments are much more prolific than my submissions. Yes I\'m REALLY going to tell you I didn\'t vote for Trump, because Rand Paul was a far superior candidate. I\'m also a huge Ayn Rand fan and can see a populist rather than political pragmatist as clear as day. Voting for the lesser of two evils is still voting for evil. Shame on you. \n\nIt\'s fucking hilarious that you\'re so ashamed of yourself that you need to believe I voted for Trump. I pointed out an example of how Hillary was corrupt and contemptible, but you just fall back to "career politician" as if it makes it okay. Truly deplorable behavior. \n\nPresidents with no political experience:\nZachary Taylor, Ulysses S. Grant, Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nI don\'t know why you\'re acting like this is unprecedented. Also, Congress has a lot of political experience and almost everyone hates the job they have been doing for the last decade. \n\n>I\'m a free-trade globalist type, so his America first moron rhetoric that plays better based on how poorly educated you are just doesn\'t resonate with me. I don\'t think coal is making a comeback and I don\'t think the solution to global warming is deregulating everything.\n\nI didn\'t vote for him so I don\'t see how this applies. These strawmans are so adorable though I could pinch your cheek! Yes, I will defend Trump when he is in the right. I will also criticize him when he is in the wrong. Want to know of a prominent conservative who does the exact same and didn\'t vote for Trump? Ben Shapiro. '
"There is something very real about the way Mueller's eyes are drawn. Very well done by the artist.\n\nGave me quite the chuckle. \n"
'I feel like innocent people are usually pretty anxious to tell their side of the story'
'I think this is an "opportunity" for Trump to lie about things Mueller already knows to be true. If he likes, the investigation gets extended and much more serious.'
"Remember that scene from Downfall how all the Germans are partying even as the Soviet shells are landing nearby? Yeah it's kind of like that"
"Exactly, and it's not naive. I know that if I were accused of something horrible and I truly was innocent I would be pushing for an interview and an opportunity to clear my name. Particularly when words like 'treason' were being thrown around. \n\nAn innocent man will take the first opportunity to clear his name. Trump is not behaving anything like this."
"I never 'left' but I don't hang out there. It's still fun to pop in and challenge their views. "
"Well, a formal invitation from Mueller is going to be a subpoena in front of a grand jury, and I'm pretty sure the lawyers are trying to avoid that."
'Soros doesn\'t fucking pay though, and neither does anyone else. Like, I was out for Occupy, and have done a ton of stuff since then, one org I was with actually applied to the Soros Foundation, and they never called us back.\n\nUnless you\'re like, super well established and have existed as an institution for 100 years and have a track record of success, Soros won\'t pay you shit. You gotta be someone like the "Planned Parenthood Action Fund" and actually be known and already successful for SorosFound to support you in any way. \n\nLeft wing fund institutions are incredibly fucking stingy. "Oh, you spent $1,000 in man-hours creating this application for funding? Here\'s $500 for your trouble, don\'t you ever fucking call us again. Oh, and we\'ll need your tax info because we\'re totally deducting this."\n\nIt\'s not like the Kochtopus on the libertarian side. Those fuckers hand out money like it\'s toilet paper.\n\nBut no, we libs are the ones who are paid shills.\n\nSMFH'
'Chances are Mueller had this info and saw it long ago, but yeah, info like this just vanishing from a government database is whack.'
'If there’s one thing I hope that comes out of this, it’s that we take a long hard look at our current system, and fix all of the bullshit like a VP pardoning the guy he ran next to when he becomes president.  \n\nLike the president’s ability to pardon his own cohorts.  Seriously.  Who had the bright idea to give unlimited pardon rights to the president?  That’s less pragmatic, and more a sweet fringe benefit of being the big man, which isn’t the intent of our system. \n\nLike firing people investigating you. \n\nLike lying to Congressional panels.  \n\nAll of it. All of this “we have to burn because they got us on a technicality” stuff is bullshit. '
'Whenever you tell yourself that the GOP is doing what they do out of cowardice you enable and excuse their behavior.  They are not supporting Trump out of cowardice.  They are supporting Trump out of *self-interest*.  And really, this is the only thing setting "dangerous precedents" for future presidents, because it is your willingness to pretend that the GOP acts counter to their interests when *this has always been their goal*.\n\nThey are *willingly complicit*, and *heavily invested* in protecting him.  Nobody is holding a gun to their heads, and they do what they do because they believe it will net them more power and more control.  \n\nThey do not refuse to impeach because *they want to but are afraid of what will happen*.  They refuse to impeach because they *have no desire to impeach him and they like what he is doing*.  They prefer a world where their president has unlimited power, because they know that if and when (and believe me, they are heavily counting on "if") a democratic president regains control, they can swing back to pretending to care about democracy and limits on presidential power.  They know they can go back to pretending to be bipartisan hacks at the drop of a hat, and people like you will let them.\n\nThey know this because it is true.  And so long as it is true, we will continue to be fucked.'
'If he pardons himself while in office and is then indicted after his term or after impeachment, he could use the pardon as a defense. \n\nIt’s not a moot point. '
'An indictment isn’t needed here, an impeachment is.  We have about 2 years left for his presidency.  An indictment would be an absolute shit show that would be held up in court for the remainder of his presidency.  An impeachment would remove him from his seat, where he would likely be pardoned by Pence and then run to Twitter 5 minutes later saying see, nothing here no evidence I committed a crime.  Or he would refuse to sign the pardon because he would have to admit guilt and that could be used against him in state charges.  \n\nLiterally, we are in uncharted territory here and anything anyone says is pure speculation.  The DOJ papers, scholarly articles, etc... all means nothing.  Some people think that the President can’t be indicted, but that’s also because it’s never happened.  A lot of people said we couldn’t put a man on the moon, until we did. \n\nThese next two year will be interesting, and it will be very interesting after November.  Regardless if the Dems take control of both houses, there will be republicans that run on Anti Trump platforms and win seats.  I feel like enough will cross the line to vote him out.  '
'I don’t feel like your making yourself clear enough, to me that read like : “ while in office he can just pardon himself for later.”\n\nSeems like you’d have to designate what crime you are being pardoned for. You couldn’t just go “ I pardon myself for any crimes I might of done or might do in the future “ \n\nAnd I’ve been drinking so I’m probably just confused but ... yeah that’s how I took it '
'Not actually true.\n\n“Perhaps the most famous presidential pardon of all time occurred before any charges were filed. Gerald Ford\'s pardon of Richard Nixon absolved the former president of "all offenses against the United States which he … has committed or may have committed or taken part in" between the date of his inauguration in 1969 and his resignation in August 1974”\n\nThat\'s as vague as it can be.  *All* offenses he has or may have committed,or taken part in.\n\n\nSource: http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2008/07/preemptive_presidential_pardons.html'

"Well no I don't believe shit polls like this.. But I also don't think trump is a good president"
"I see. So where the democratic equivalent? Basically what I'm getting is that almost all of the candidates voters fell for the trick but trump had a few more who did. This reads in a way that tries to display trump supporters as being dumb. I think that's a bit dishonest. Sure they voted more than the rest, but not by much. Without a comparison of Hillary supporters and a similarly deceptive question the confirmation bias is strong with this one.\n\nNot you necessarily. You're a cool fellow :P"

Trump isn't Jesus and I don't intend to follow him like he is.

Be good for any debates in the future."
"I'm skeptical of that number too. Troll questions get troll answers. I don't think they had Democratic preference in the poll but my guess is you'd have more Bernie people than Hillary people supporting bombing Agrabah too.

I don't know the percentage of smart asses in the total population, but you'd have to subtract that from 30 to get the number of trigger happy morons. "

We had a Democratic party that refused to pull a fast one and get a Democratic President put in place as, at the time Watergate was exposed, Spiro Agnew had resigned, and there was no VP, so if Nixon was impeached or resigned, the Speaker of the House, Carl Albert, a Democrat, would become President.

'> Special Counsel Robert Mueller\'s investigators met this past summer with the former British spy whose dossier on alleged Russian efforts to aid the Trump campaign spawned months of investigations that have hobbled the Trump administration, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\n> Information from Christopher Steele, a former MI-6 officer, could help investigators determine whether contacts between people associated with the Trump campaign and suspected Russian operatives broke any laws.\n\n> CNN has learned that the FBI and the US intelligence community last year took the Steele dossier more seriously than the agencies have publicly acknowledged. James Clapper, then the director of national intelligence, said in a January 2017 statement that the intelligence community had "not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable."\n\n> The intelligence agencies, particularly the CIA, and the FBI took Steele\'s research seriously enough that they kept it out of a publicly-released January report on Russian meddling in the election in order to not divulge which parts of the dossier they had corroborated and how.\n\n> This contrasts with attempts by President Donald Trump and some lawmakers to discredit Steele and the memos he produced.\n\n> Ever since the dossier came to light in January, Trump and his allies have repeatedly insisted that it is a complete work of fiction. He told The New York Times this summer that the dossier "was totally made-up stuff." In a series of tweets earlier this year, Trump said the memos were written by a "failed spy" who had relied on "totally made-up facts by sleazebag political operatives."\n\n> While the most salacious allegations in the dossier haven\'t been verified, its broad assertion that Russia waged a campaign to interfere in the election is now accepted as fact by the US intelligence community. CNN also reported earlier this year that US investigators have corroborated some aspects of the dossier, specifically that some of the communications among foreign nationals mentioned in the memos did actually take place.\n\n'

The anti-elite sentiment drives a desire for sensationalized press, and that populism is why outlets like the Wall Street Journal, which does great reporting from a conservative perspective, are labelled "MSM" rather than being accepted as "conservative media."'

'> You keep saying, "meh, Trump\'s deputy campaign chairman communicating with a Russian military intelligence officer isn\'t a big deal because he had a long history with that Russian military intelligence officer."\n\nI\'m saying Gates talking to someone he\'s worked with for over 10 years is not proof of collusion.  I assume you mean Kilimnik, a *former* Russian intelligence agent, at a time when all Russian men were required to serve in the military.  Kilimnik denies he is involved with Russian intelligence currently, and there is (once again) **zero public evidence** that this is not true.  Maybe he\'s clean, maybe he\'s Putin\'s right hand man.\n\nIf he is working directly for Putin, their relationship is clearly a coincidence with Trump.  There\'s no way in 2005 anyone would have predicted Trump would run for President, much less choose Manafort for a campaign chairman.\n\nWe know about Kilimnik, because Gates gave that information to Mueller.  We\'ll see what happens, \n\n> You don\'t see the logical flaw in that? His deputy campaign chairman had a longstanding relationship with a Russian military intelligence officer. \n\nYes, I agree, Manafort and Gates should not have been brought aboard, for many reasons.  But this is not evidence of Russian collusion.\n\n> That isn\'t normal. Most folks don\'t work for years with Russian military intelligence officers, and the folks that do don\'t become deputy campaign chairmen of American presidential campaigns.\n\n[Really?](http://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/373363-democratic-ties-to-russia-are-ample-and-often-ethically-dubious)\n\n>A Washington lobbying/consulting firm, the Podesta Group, founded by Obama adviser and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and his brother, lobbied for Russia’s largest bank [Sherbank], owned by the government (or, as you like, President Putin). \n\n>“Sberbank  is the Kremlin, they don’t do anything major without Putin’s go-ahead, and they don’t tell him ‘no’ either,” explained a retired senior U.S. intelligence official. According to a Reuters report, Tony Podesta was “among the high-profile lobbyists registered to represent organizations backing Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich.” Among these was the European Center, which paid Podesta $900,000 for his lobbying.

John Podesta left the firm years ago; Tony stepped down last November amid controversy over the lobbying. He has not been charged with any crimes.\n\n> The Podesta Group also represented Russia-owned Uranium One, which received approval from a federal oversight board that included the State Department under Hillary Clinton to buy about one-fifth of the U.S. production capacity of uranium, a key material for making nuclear weapons.\n\n> Uranium One interests reportedly contributed $145 million to Bill and Hillary Clinton’s charitable foundation.\n\n> Bill Clinton was paid $500,000 for one speech from a Russian investment bank that has “links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.” [(Forbes)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulroderickgregory/2017/02/18/no-one-mentions-that-the-russian-trail-leads-to-democratic-lobbyists/#5588db9f3991)\n\n>The lead Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), engaged with a Russian caller posing as a Ukrainian contact offering Russian blackmail material against President Trump. Afterward, Schiff made arrangements for his staff to try to collect the material. It turns out the caller was a Russian radio-host spoofer. Schiff has said he was not really fooled by the call.\n\n>The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner (D-Va.), had extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch to help connect with the author of the anti-Trump “dossier.” Warner reportedly texted at the time that he didn’t wish to “leave a paper trail.” Warner allegedly waited six months before disclosing the contacts to the committee, which is investigating Russia matters. \n\n>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Hillary Clinton campaign funded the anti-Trump “dossier” that relied on Russian sources, who were close to Kremlin officials.\n\nSeems like they can become campaign chairmen for the Clintons.  Oh, you say the dealings with those Russians weren\'t Russian intelligence?  Well, Kilimnik is not Russian intelligence now either then.\n\nMaybe people who take millions from Russian oligarchs, or whose spouses get paid $500,000 for an hour speech from Russian oligarchs shouldn\'t be Presidential candidates.

"Actually, the Russians, like the Trumps benefactors, the Koch Bros, are heavily invested in the hydrocarbon industry.

It would be a catastrophe for them should be switch our energy consumption fro hydrocarbons to renewables. The Russian of course have huge reserves of oil so the steady increase of hydrocarbon consumption helps them out.\n\nThe first thing Trumo does is put a tariff on solar cells from China, they have a huge solar cell capacity as they are switching over to renawables twice as fast as the US. The Chinese' economies of scale means they can produce solar arrays faster and cheaper than the US. The fact that the US solar industry cannot scale up to produce enough solar arrays to feed the demand of its own US clients means that China is capturing almost every market in the world. The Solar Cell tariffs sundown in 4 more years and no economist think it will benefit the US solar economy, as new factories will not come on line to taje advantage of the tariffs before they sundown but it will help the Chinese and the Russians If you look at the EPA, NASA and almost every other federal agency that measures and control emission and hydrocarbon standards are under attack to help the hydrocarbon industry. fortunatly to repeal most of the important pollution controls, the EPA and other agencies do not have supportive documentation to show the court when the EPA is sued, so only very simple rules will be actually repealed.

I also don't think undergrad school = your IQ. (IQ is also socially determined, is a biased criteria \nJust using as short hand for intelligence as flawed as it is) People from privileged backgrounds are accepted at a much higher rate into higher ranked universities-- education levels of parents, access to best k-12 schools, all the other privileges of being wealthy, and being white are still huge advantages in life in the US today. In Trump's time, it was even more so... I know someone who is slightly younger than Trump who went to Princeton, he has commented that before his time, it was even harder to get into Princeton being Jewish ... can you imagine how hard in the 60s being a poor minority from a crappy inner city school would have been to get into UPenn in comparison to Trump? Bush, president 43, is the same age as Trump and went to Yale...proving again my point.\n  \nSorry-not sorry but Trump's elitism about education and hypocrisy about ignoring Fordham gets my goat.

'He\'s still a foot soldier in his own particular party, and maintains all the requisite interpersonal connections. In both major parties, certain people just kind of waft around until there is a elected seat somewhere being contested, or a post somewhere to be filled, and so the party either supports those peoples\' campaigns or recommends their being appointed to those posts.\n\nIn each party, the same people get recycled over and over again for decades, almost like a political machine. For instance, people like Don Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney and John Ashcroft kept popping up somewhere or another in elected seats or appointed posts for the GOP starting from as far back as -- in the case of Rumsfeld -- the Eisenhower administration. On the other hand, the Democrats have people like Joe Biden, John Kerry and Tim Kaine.\n\nSantorum served two terms in the US House, and two terms in the US Senate. I can almost guarantee that his name is on an unwritten list of \'reliable conservatives\' that gets pulled from memory whenever there are posts somewhere to be filled, and that since Trump got elected, *at least one* person has asked the question, "What about Santorum? What\'s he up to?" when looking for people who could fill various posts in the new administration.'

You're just shooting from the hip based on how you feel, as if your goddamn emotions are something any of us should consider as a valid talking point.

'Well, you have kind of a point.\n\nTraditionally, Special Counsels/Prosecutors have been chosen from the opposite party to the president. Mueller, being a Republican, goes against that tradition. However, I thought he was exactly the right person for the job as soon as I heard the announcement. The man has integrity deep down in his bones.\n\nAs long as they leave him to do his job, he will get to the truth.'
"What evidence do you have to support your integrity theory?\n\nI have never seen or heard him take any stance on anything at all.  \n\nSeems like a guy who just wants to avoid attention.\n\nNow ask yourself - do you think investigating the president is going to draw some attention?\n\nSo perhaps ... he won't.  "
'Lol bruh you crazy\n\nYou must be one of those new age everything is corrupt types. Some people have integrity and respect for the offices and positions they hold. Judging from his track record Mueller is one of those people.\n\nEdit: Not to mention there is precedent for investigating and impeaching high profile American leaders already. With those leaders all having more political clout than donald trump.'

'And a substantial amount of those who are interested in politics are not interested in facts. '
"I'd say that most people do follow politics, but they only parroted stuffs they heard from families or friend circles. In short, they followed politics veeery loosely without knowing anything.\n\nI'd say these people wouldn't know any criminal indictments until the A-list criminals around Trump inner circles like Bannon, Roger Stone or Jared get indicted for Russian stuffs. "
"I'm sure Mueller's testicles are galvanized steel. However, the true power rises from the majestic jawline. "
"You're going to have to source all that, and show more connections between each. It does sound like a massive stretch. Uranium One is under investigation by congress, not the DoJ, FBI, or Mueller. The Podesta group is a lobbying firm, they're allowed to deal with foreign clients. \n\nAt this point in time Russia wasn't under sanctions so the sale isn't illegal, the uranium can't be exported and isn't used for weapons, a 9 person committee had to unanimously approve the sale. I don't see how its related at all to the Mueller investigation.\n\nDon Jr\nJared Kushner\nMichael Flynn\nCarter Page\n\nAre all more likely. "
"Dude, calm down. This isn't Trump vs Hillary anymore, the election is over. This is an investigation to find illegal activity, everybody in this thread should want any criminals within our government to be indicted, not just ones from the other party. That's crazy. And nobody should get their news from one source, including both Hillary supporters and Trump supporters. Do yourself a favor and read some opposing viewpoints and try to actually disprove them. Like be critical of your own thoughts, not just the thoughts of others. There's a reason Russian efforts seem to always favor Donald Trump. Whether there's collusion or not, why does Russia want to help them? That's a very fair question and one that should not be easily dismissed. "
"Making a single argument to some internet person isn't really interesting. What's fascinating is how these people cognate all this, I would love to sit them down in person and figure out how somebody like that can function. There are very few people like that where I live. "
'Of course they remember. They just don’t care. They aren’t getting paid to go out there and be honest and well educated. They are being paid to drive up ratings and persuade Americans to support politicians who will help rich people. Not necessarily in that order.'
'Why are you giving credit to a Republican?  the_dumb worshiper?'
'So is Trump a complete idiot or was he smart enough to work out a deal with Russia to ensure he won the presidency of the strongest military in the world against an opponent that had a 99% probability of beating him?\n\nAsking for a friend...'
'So he’s a pawn that managed to win a Presidency? Was Obama a pawn too?'
"No doubt, but it was fighting these demaons as well as his own, that finally caught up with him.\n\nI was fortunate to meet both Hunter S. Thompson and Donald Trump, in person, well before either became famous, Trump at a CUNY housing seminar in New York in '78 and Thompson, at a talk at Cal-Berkeley in '74. I was far more inspired by Thompson's take on life than Trumps take on Housing. Thompson had just published his seminal F&L on the Campaign Trail, and quite frankly said to everybody that Nixon will walk with a pardon, but hoped he will resign (he was right) Trump told everyone at the Housing seminar that he will become a Billionaire, but not in Housing, but in Real Estate redevelopment in New York City. They were both right but Thompson was at least high."
"Not only that, but Nixon has some nice qualities in him, like created EPA,and overall being smart, albeit paranoid. Also, Vietnam negotiation aside, Watergate was less of the original event and more of the batshit insane cover-ups.\n\nTrump's basically stupid Nixon that has virtually no redeeming feature, and with Watergate not being illegal spying and break in to political opponents, but an offer by foreign entities that he couldn't refuse."
'Lucky guy, wish I could have met Hunter myself. He was a true patriot. '

'I was actually hoping for someone like Adam Schiff. But yeah'
"Not saying I want Pelosi to be president.  Just saying that it's a possible thing that could happen in the next year or so.  And I find it interesting that Trump might not only sink the Republican party, but *also* hand America its first female president in the same fell swoop."

Republicans actively suppott and defend him. The NRA elected a man who committed treason as their president while taking Russian funds to arm pro Russian, Confederate, KKK and Nazi personal in the states with an active method of transporting arms across the US. 3d printing and gun powder stock pilings have been functioning for a while now. \n\n\nConservitives and Russia have been activity Target recruiting ex- military personnel. ICE is still gearing up and preparing mass deportation and possible human round ups. \n\n\nTrump's effort to alienate and isolate the United States is working. Mueller and his team have a single shot at hitting every effort to obstruct Justice, even then he's only powerful and he's granted.\n\n\nVoting obstruction and division is and will continue to be employed.\n\n\nThe few hard lined conservitives I know have been itching for a civil war for decades. \n\n\nQuite literally, the only force keeping Trump at Bay right now, is our military and police forces.

Again, the special counsel’s purpose is to remove the image of bias or conflicts of interest; not telling the public about conflicts of interest and bias within the special counsel goes completely against that. A simple, “We found some bias, so we removed him. Thanks.” would have been better than what we got. \n\nYou’re just trying to downplay the significance of this. It’s not just Fox reporting on the texts, I’ve seen articles by Politico and CBS. \n\n'
'Wrong. They are. Like I said bias in the criminal justice system, even if just perceived is a huge issue. You don’t want people who are biased investigating/prosecuting/representing/etc. subjects of the case. \n\nWrong again, it’s everyone’s business and especially when the people assigned to investigate without bias and conflicts of interest are shown to have bias and conflicts of interest. It’s not just Fox. If this was just another manufactured story you wouldn’t see multiple other news sources report on it. \n\nI’m going to keep repeating this because it destroys your entire argument; the texts would have disqualified these people from being on a jury in a Trump/Clinton trial but not a special counsel whose sole purpose is to conduct an unbiased investigation free from conflicts of interest? There really is no response to that simple fact. At some point you’re going to have to not be biased and realize that this isn’t a partisan issue. Bias and conflicts of interest are a huge no no in the criminal justice system. '

'**Rhoticity in English**\n\nRhoticity in English refers to English speakers\' pronunciation of the historical rhotic consonant /r/, and is one of the most prominent distinctions by which varieties of English can be classified. The historical English /r/ sound is preserved in all pronunciation contexts in the "rhotic varieties" of English, which primarily include the English dialects of Scotland, Ireland, and most of the United States and Canada. However, the historical /r/ is not pronounced except before vowels in "non-rhotic varieties", which include most of the dialects of modern England, Wales, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and some parts of the southern and eastern—particularly northeastern—coastal United States.In non-rhotic varieties, speakers no longer pronounce /r/ in postvocalic environments—that is, when it is immediately after a vowel and not followed by another vowel.  For example, a rhotic English speaker pronounces the words hard and butter as /ˈhɑːrd/ and /ˈbʌtər/, whereas a non-rhotic speaker "drops" or "deletes" the /r/ sound, pronouncing them as /ˈhɑːd/ and /ˈbʌtə/.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

"At some point, hopefully a big enough portion of the public (and maybe even some of his supporters) will want him to do it just to get it over with so they think they can move on. He might make it one sentence without purjuring himself, but he's got a very established 'pattern of criminality' as far as giving false statements goes.  \n\nHis testimony may not even be required, if enough people around him can testify against him, and provide enough evidence to seal his fate. We know Spicer was notorious about taking notes, to the point some whitehouse staff literally made fun of him for always carrying notebooks. There's also the matter of more people striking plea deals, like Gates is, and the more people turn, the more rats will try to abandon that sinking ship. Especially since they're starting to throw charges around at the State level, which aren't eligible for presidental pardons, so it's not even an option for him to save them. "

We've been taking for more steps to cut out the corruption in the last year than we ever have. He has united us....Against him, and against most of his radical constituents. "
"I voted for Trump... not because I supported him, I felt disenfranchised by the democratic party after what they did to Bernie Sanders.  The impression I was given was that the democratic party felt entitled to my vote, I was told that I had to vote for Hillary, I owed my support to the party.  But, I don't work that way, I did not (and I still don't) support Hillary Clinton, both candidates were unpalatable to me.  While this isn't directly the party's fault, I was bombarded by activists shaming me for my choice to not vote, that was when I decided to use my vote as a protest and cast it for Donald Trump.  I don't regret that Hillary did not win, but I do regret that Trump is the president and had I known there was even the slightest chance he would actually win, I would have stuck to my original plan to not vote at all.  \n\nI live in a red state, so ultimately my vote didn't matter but I can't help but feel responsible in some small way for where we are now.  It's a shameful thing, I've never even told my friends about it and only a few members of my family know.  For a long time I didn't believe the Russia story, I just assumed Democrats were swinging wildly to push back against a controversial president.  I dismissed the dossier out of hand as ridiculous but now it seems all of it was true, or that it could be true.  I'm sorry that I helped perpetuate this, even if my vote didn't matter."

She destroyed evidence after it was subpoenaed. She did it all. \n\nBut apparently she didnt intend to break the law. Thats what comey testified.

'> They were called the National Socialist party you dweeb.\n\nHoly fucking god damn shit if I see this one more time.\n\n>Early on, they were definitely what we would call "socialist." When the NSDAP was created, they released a 25-point program that did include many stipulations and demands that were recognized as socialist, including state ownership of land (point 17) and redistribution of capital (point 14).\n\n>***The Nazis then proceeded to enact precisely none of those policies when they had control of the government.*** All the socialist demands dropped off completely and the nationalist ones became the party platform - the part about citizenship being restricted to the German race (read: not Jews) and demands of land/territory for expansion (Lebensraum).\n\n> There was a wing of the Nazi party that did actually take the "socialism" part of their name seriously and tried to recruit the same working class young people that the communists did. The Strasser brothers (Gregor and Otto) were the most important leaders of this "left wing" of the party, and Roehm was in there as well. The Nazis also worked with the communists in the Berlin transit strike.\n\n>However, ***Hitler himself was definitely in the "conservative wing" of the party and he obviously won***. One of the Strassers was murdered in 1934 as Hitler purged the party of its left wing. The main Nazis who emerged in power, with the exception of Goebbels, who switched from the Strasser faction to Hitler, didn\'t have any attachment to socialism whatsoever and worked hand-in-hand with big business.\n'
'**It Can\'t Happen Here**\n\nIt Can\'t Happen Here is a semi-satirical 1935 political novel by American author Sinclair Lewis, and a 1936 play adapted from the novel by Lewis and John C. Moffitt.\n\nPublished during the rise of fascism in Europe, the novel describes the rise of Berzelius "Buzz" Windrip, a politician who defeats Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) and is elected President of the United States, after fomenting fear and promising drastic economic and social reforms while promoting a return to patriotism and "traditional" values. After his election, Windrip takes complete control of the government and imposes a plutocratic/totalitarian rule with the help of a ruthless paramilitary force, in the manner of Adolf Hitler and the SS. The novel\'s plot centers on journalist Doremus Jessup\'s opposition to the new regime and his subsequent struggle against it as part of a liberal rebellion.\n\nReviewers at the time, and literary critics ever since, have emphasized the connection with Louisiana politician Huey Long, who was preparing to run for president in the 1936 election when he was assassinated in 1935 just prior to the novel\'s publication.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

'Just a nitpick if you made this image: The Bronze Star needs to have a V device on it like [this one](https://jonathanturley.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/bronze-star-v-device.jpg). Yes, it matters.\n\nIt also should be displayed to the left of the Purple Heart, as it has higher standing than the Purple Heart.\n\nEdit: Further nitpicking: The third medal there is the Army Commendation Medal and should be the Navy Commendation Medal with a V device and a Silver Star like [this one](https://i.ezr.io/_img/racks/4859112545ad62c06c72541.28790244.png?w=112&fm=pjpg)\n\nFurther Edit: His [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mueller) page states he has these [Seven medals](https://i.ezr.io/_img/racks/2108951405ad63110339cc9.40707010-expanded.jpg?w=400) plus the ribbon shown in the OP, plus the Parachutist Badge.

'There should be another award for leaving that promising education/career track and *volunteering* to join the Marines and go to Vietnam..\n\nThis was a time when guys would inhale a bit of Mercury so it’d look like they had a hole in their lung in the X-rays during their physical (or so I’ve been told).\n\nMaybe a giant pair of brass balls or something.'
'The V device stands for Valor, on both the Bronze Star and the Navy Commendation. Both awards can be earned for Meritorious service, but Mueller got them for courage in combat.\n\nThe star on the Navy Commendation means he has two of them, though only one is for Valor.'
"First part of your comment is absolutely correct, and something missed by a lot of comments.\n\nHowever, he did seem to try to profer that info regarding a lack of retainer and such clearly to indicate he wasn't his attorney.\n\nIf he assumed, at the time he made the statements, that they were protected by pricilege, then by the very definition of the New York Bar's ethical rules (and really everyone else's similar rule), he had assumed an attorney/client relationship. And, again, Cohen submitted sworn pleadings saying that Hannity was a client. If that's the case, what does it matter whether or not he had paid a retainer?\n\nAnd finally, when reporting on such a story, isn't it a relevant conflict when you're defending the guy when you are simultaneously 33% of his entire client base? I would think so -- regardless of my political inclinations. Let's be fair."
'>You guys just keep fishing, acting like Sean wouldn\'t have railed against the Cohen raid if he didn\'t get legal advice from Cohen and was afraid of getting disclosed.\n\nBut why would he? Raiding a lawyer of the President is no easy task. I imagine the warrant that allowed them to do that will be one of the most scrutinized warrants of all time. You think a judge was just like "lol it\'s Trump\'s lawyer do whatever bro"?\n\nI don\'t understand why Hannity would be against the raid unless he has some interest beyond truth. (IE: he has something with Cohen he doesn\'t want found *or* he wants Trump to not have an investigation going for...some...reason?\n\n>He rails against Mueller and the Russia coup every day.\n\nI don\'t really understand why anyone would speak out against the Mueller investigation. You\'d think they\'d want Mueller to do his investigation and be like "ya, Trump was right the whole time".\n\nEdit: Regarding Hannity specifically, I don\'t think he matters that much. It\'s just funny that Cohen was like "Um, attorney client privileged" and Hannity was like "uh, I was never his client." It kinda makes Cohen look extra dumb.'
'I agree with much of what you wrote, though my views are nuanced. \n\nI think what needs to be emphasized is Hannity\'s lack of legal knowledge.  It\'s reasonable to think that Hannity thought he could have privileged conversations with someone (and to hand over a $10 bill to obtain the privilege) yet still not be formally considered that person\'s client. I love Hannity but I\'m not blind - he has no idea what he\'s talking about when it comes to attorney-client privilege.  \n\nWhile I do think Hannity should have disclosed his "conflict", I think there\'s a lot of mitigating factors which don\'t make this a big deal, such as:\n\n1. He would be railing against the Cohen raid/Mueller witch hunt anyway. \n\n2. He, with his lack of legal knowledge, could have genuinely thought he wasn\'t a client of Cohen\'s if the extent of his relationship with Cohen was informal legal advice about real estate deals (a couple of phone calls here and there)\n\n3. If you want to be fair, you need to hold liberal pundits who use the same attorneys/firms and/or have close personal relationships with people like the Clintons and Obamas to the same standard.  In my opinion, this "Hannity standard" is ridiculous, many pundits on both sides have powerful, ideologically aligned friends (and even non-ideologically aligned friends).\n\nHowever, I agree with Dershowitz and am glad he gave Hannity an earful.  Given the political sensitivity in this particular instance I would have preferred disclosure but I also don\'t think its really a big deal.\n'
'Ok, and I apologize for my late reply, however: \n\nFrom a pro-Hannity perspective, I don\'t see those statements as being necessarily exclusive of each other. Hannity, who doesn\'t really understand how attorney-client privilege works, can reasonably think that he can pay someone $10 to have privileged discussions yet still not be considered, legally, that person\'s formal client. \n\nYet at the end of the day it\'s just not relevant. What is there to be suspicious over?  One cannot reasonably advocate for turning the Mueller Trump-Russia collusion probe into full-fledged life-investigations into anyone caught in Mueller\'s web. I understand how this story would raise eyebrows, but when you dig into it and learn that about a year ago Hannity on his show publicly mentioned talking to Cohen about the real estate deal in Dubai, and consider Hannity\'s lack of legal knowledge (and embarrassment at having been caught blindsided at being mentioned...I honestly think he didn\'t consider himself a client), I don\'t see what\'s "suspicious".\n\nWhile we may still disagree, I\'d like to say that despite the downvote, my conversations in this sub have been incredibly civil and its very refreshing. It\'s good to see that some of you are interested in the truth and equal application of justice under the law, no matter which side the hammer falls on. '
'My position is while I personally would have liked disclosure, it\'s 1) a ridiculous standard and 2) everyone on this sub losing their minds about Hannity is hypocritical because they are not applying the Hannity Standard to commentators on their (or, if neutral, the other) political side. \n\n1. So we disagree on the probability Hannity thought he was a "client".  Also, we can talk about bias all day -- I think your assumption that its "not probable" reflects your bias. \n\n2.  So why don\'t all of the media disclose all of their personal and/or professional relationships with DNC/Clinton/Obama? You\'re not holding commentators on both sides to the Hannity Standard, only.....Hannity.  I don\'t see anybody on this sub criticizing George Stephanopoulos for not disclosing he was Bill\'s Communications Director and later Senior Advisor. BUT I also don\'t expect it because I just disagree with the standard you are trying to impose.\n\n3.  "I think it would reflect proper journalistic integrity to reveal a personal or professional relationship if you are reporting on a matter" I agree that this is a good sentiment for JOURNALISTS doing solely fact-based reporting, but Hannity is not a journalist, he is a commentator. If Rachel Maddow used Perkins Coie for some real estate advice I don\'t think she needs to disclose that despite it admittedly being some juicy tabloid fodder (as the Hannity stuff was for you guys)\n\n4.  You can\'t just dismiss someone validly pointing out double standards via "whataboutism".  We don\'t need to compare everything to the Clintons, but because your side does not believe in the equal application of standards (whether legal or not), such comparisons are justified in order to point out the blatant disregard for said equal application of the standards. \n\nWhile you may be the exception, the vast majority of lefties do NOT apply the same standards to their favored politicians and commentators. It\'s one thing to be "biased" and be more sympathetic to your side\'s position; it\'s another to wholly embrace double standards benefitting your side and dismiss anyone who calls them out on it with "whataboutism". \n\n'

SF is registering certain non-citizens who have children in the local school systems (many of the children are citizens by birth) to vote in the local school board election, but those registrations do not extend to any other election at any level, and therefore it IS perfectly legal to do - it's completely within the jurisdiction of the city to make special laws pertaining to city-level elections.

Others would totally jump on a fiscally conservative/socially liberal or moderate platform.\n\nI totally get what you're saying though. I've had conversations with many of the smart Republicans I know, and they either use mental gymnastics to convince themselves that charity can fill the voids created by Republican policies, or they believe we should fund the social net by reducing the military (obviously dissenting from the R platform on this issue). However, they still feel more strongly about low taxes, lower regulation on their businesses, etc. \n\n"
"Absolutely. Trump was within his legal rights to fire Comey. His motivation is what would make it obstruction. Same thing applies if he were to fire Rosenstein in order to effect the dissolution of the probe. It's legal for him to do so, but the legal act may become obstruction of justice based on his motives."

"Manafort is in the Northern Neck Regional Jail in Virginia about 90 miles from DC. He *checked in* around 8 pm. His personal visitation day is Fridays from 2:15 to 3:15 and visits can only be for 30 minutes with up to 3 family members/friends. It's the type of visitation through glass where both inmate and visitors talk on the phone. He can also have video conferencing with family/friends throughout the week...it doesn't look like any limit on nbr of video calls but each one can only be 20 minutes. That means in-person Manafort will only be able to have visits from attorneys and attorney staff until *next* Friday. Attorneys cannot bring any of his friends or family with them -- indeed they have to sign an affidavit if any non-attorneys present that these people are not his family or friends.\n  \n* That's a long time for someone accustomed to the finer things to only have inmates, jail officers, members of the justice system like Mueller and his own attorneys for company imho. \n  \nHe's in the VIP section of the jail. CNN reported he was taken to this jail for his safety.\n  \nIt sounds like it'll be a long 3 months for Paulie if he's not preemptively pardoned."

'[The NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/us/politics/questions-mueller-wants-to-ask-trump-russia.html) specifically says "recently provided President Trump’s lawyers a list of questions he wants answered in an interview" and they got a copy, but "they are not quoted verbatim, and some were condensed."\n\nI don\'t think this jives with what CNN is reporting.  "Extrapolating from topics discussed with the special counsel" is not the same as "recently provided President Trump’s lawyers a list of questions".\n\n(I\'m not saying the leak didn\'t come from Trump\'s team, mind you.)'
'Although at the point they question Trump \\(if ever\\) the investigators will have \\(via months of  interviews, grand jury testimony and evidence collection\\) have a good bead on exactly the story of the case. That is why they will wait to question Trump last.'

"We shouldn't advocate violence, even against traitors. Let the justice system do its job, otherwise it's vengeance."
"I mean I'd like to think so, but if you look at the timelines for other federal investigations and compare then it looks like Mueller's investigation is not too far along. The good news is there are enough senate republicans backing Mueller that filibustering a replacement for Rosenstein is probable.\n\nA kill switch would mean guaranteed conviction on charges of at least obstruction of justice. But the reality is that with only an obstruction of justice charge people will take to the streets and riot. Mueller needs time to build a case, organize the evidence, and piece together a timeline. To do this properly I think we're looking at another year minimum for all those involved to be charged. My best guess is that 1.5-2years from now this will becoming to an end."
"Obstruction of justice for sure because we already have the Nixon template for how to handle this. But why such a low probability for the tax evasion and money laundering? I feel like Trump encourages investigations into his finances simply by the sheer fact that he never released his tax returns and he specifically told mueller he's not allowed to look at his finances."
'Why did all of this happened? Because their citizens accepted all of this. Clearly everyone who fought for freedom of speech and basically everything around that has been for nothing. But lets not get too persimistic, Mueller will make everything back to how it was.'
'I wouldn’t be surprised if Trump has always done his taxes legally, but that’s only cause it’s easier for wealthy people to not pay taxes.'

'I thought I remembered hearing that there were a lot of Russian bots tied to the rabid Sanders support, and that he had been targeted too. It made sense to me because I hadn\'t met a legit, stereotypical "Bernie Bro" IRL, yet was constantly hearing about them and seeing examples of them on social media. Kinda like how I\'ve never met a vegan who tried to force me to become vegan, but I have met a ton of people who bitch about "preachy vegans." Otherwise, the only preachy vegan shit I\'ve ever seen has come from some text post on Tumblr. Doesn\'t mean they don\'t exist, just that I noticed what I was seeing a lot of online didn\'t measure up to my in-person, day to day experiences. It reminds me those old-wive\'s tales that get passed around where it\'s like "well I have a friend who had a friend who..."\n\nI agree with everything you said your comment -- all seems like reassuring news to me. '
"Russia's goal wasn't necessarily to push trump, but to divide the country.  They happen to have gotten a very useful idiot out of the process though.\n\nAll considered, planting a man in the campaign of a promising underdog candidate isn't a bad idea if their goal is to break apart the democrats.  I guess we'll see how far this goes, but for now, I'd like to see if any more reputable sources pick this up.  I don't really have the highest opinion of the sites that are running this story so far."
"Oops, I hired a foreign agent to manage my campaign!\n\nOops, my campaign changed the GOP platform to benefit Russian interests!\n\nOops, I knew that Russia was responsible, but I kept saying others were.\n\nOops, my NSA had to go (which I really didn't want to happen) because he was caught having secret meetings with the Russian ambassador, which he then lied about to the FBI.\n\nOops, I fired my FBI director to stop the investigation.\n\nOops, my son had a meeting with Russian agents who promised him dirt.\n\nOops, I then instructed him to lie about the reason for that meeting.\n\nOops, I sided with Putin over my intelligence agencies and Department of Justice.\n\nYeah, I guess you're right, surely this is nothing more than a bad choice of campaign manager."
'I\'d say that Bernie Sanders genuinely did not have a cult of personality in the same way that Trump does. The core distinction, in my view, is that Bernie\'s supporters saw him as a *champion*, where Trump\'s supporters see Trump as a *leader*.\n\nThe difference lies in who is working for who. To Bernie supporters, the important thing was getting a progressive into office. Any progressive would do. Bernie was adopted as their candidate of choice because he was a high-profile progressive running for president, but Bernie himself was never anything more than the face of the movement. If Bernie had suddenly said, "Actually, now that I think about it, universal health care is bad", then his core supporters would have abandoned him. Their support was conditional on his support of their favored policies.\n\nNow, it\'s true that a lot of Trump supporters see Trump like that. But the core Trump supporters, the true cult of personality, do not. They don\'t see Trump as working for them, they see themselves as working for Trump. If Trump were to declare tomorrow that he was enacting open borders, his core supporters would immediately become pro-open-borders. It\'s a *literal* cult, and the central tenet of the faith is that Trump is always right.'
'Also when you still believe (to this day) the LIE that Clinton won because of super delegates; you might have something clouding reality. '
'I agree with you, even if the majority of Reddit does not. I initially supported Bernie, but got totally turned off, not only by him and his inept campaign, but by his rabid supporters. There were comparisons to Jesus, Ghandi, Mother Teresa. The cult got creepy and extreme. I pray he doesn’t run again. '

"Interesting stuff! In the UK we don't have a written constitution, so our rights come from an accumulation of years of precedence, custom, and acts of parliament. I think there's equivalent rights over here but it's not as specifically enumerated as in the 5th amendment. There's waning and waxing enthusiasm for a proper bill of rights but nothing has come of it, because by and large we feel that we value being able to change the law as time dictates without having to make it a massive deal (like amending the Constitution is in the US).\n\nIs the 5th amendment a thing that has had its day, do you think? An anomaly that no longer serves its purpose (as it seems to be a bit of a non-starter from my point of view) or is it a vital part of the framework? If the constitution was written today, would it still be in there?\n\nBeyond the scope of the original post I know but I'm curious."

Trump says he surrounds himself with the best people. Mueller does it better.
What Happens If Trump Refuses To Be Interviewed By Mueller? -- If the White House does choose defiance and Mueller responds with a subpoena, it would likely set up a high-stakes legal showdown—one in which the special counsel might have the upper hand.
In a closed-door meeting, Trump casually comments it might be good to consolidate power like China and make himself president for life.
White House says Trump will NOT be congratulating Putin on his election win, in part because of recent nerve agent attacks as well as serious irregularities in the Russian election. Trump, on his own, promptly calls Putin to congratulate him on his landslide “victory”.

'\n\n>On November  16, 2016,  Alex  Copson, the  managing  partner  of  ACU, and  ACU  Counsel Donald  Gross  circulated  a  briefing  memo  entitled  “TRUMP/PUTIN  ME  Marshall plan CONCEPT.”   It stated  that “ACU  team members  [are]  highly  engaged  with  key  Trump Admin members.”   The  document  stated  that ACU  had  secured  the cooperation  of  a Ukrainian nuclear  company  and that  this  approach  would “require  Ukraine  to support lifting  US  and EU  sanctions  on Russia  in  line  with  the  highest foreign  policy  priority  of the  incoming  Trump  administration.”   It  stated,  “The APU/IPG  project  facilitates  and accelerates  lifting  these sanctions  by  providing  Ukraine’s  premier  nuclear  company, Turbatom”  with a  $45 billion contract to  build  Middle  East nuclear  reactors.   It also stated that  **“Key  players  in both Saudi  and Qatar”  had been  “briefed”  and were  “in  go status pending Trump/Putin co-operation.”**\n\n>On November  18, 2016,  Pentagon official  Reuben  Sorensen sent  an  email  to Mr. Copson stating:   “Alex—as  I  mentioned before,  Flynn is  getting  closer  to National  Security Advisor.  Expect  an announcement  soon.  This  is  a  big  win for  the  ACU  project.  Spoke with him  via  backchannels  earlier  this  week.  He  has  always  believed in the  vision of  the ACU  effort.”   Sorensen  added, **“We  need to let  him  get  settled into the  new  position, but update him shortly after.  More to follow.

'Hey, friend! Just so you know, being the "subject" of an investigation isn\'t the same as being a "target" in an investigation.\n\n"The term “target of an investigation” is also specifically defined by the DOJ. A person is a target where the prosecutor or Grand Jury has substantial evidence linking him to the commission of a crime. Designation as a target provides a clear warning of a person’s criminal exposure."\n\nIt\'s entirely possible he is no longer a subject and has now become a target. Politicians and lawyers are very tricky with their words for a reason. \n\nI hope this helps you. :) '

"The description of Trump's hair by Ivanka in Wolff's book was absolute gold. The whole book is gold, to be honest, but I'll go ahead and transcribe that part for those who haven't had time to read it yet:\n\n> ...in at least one television interview she made fun of his comb-over. She often described the mechanics behind it to friends: an absolutely clean pate -- a contained island after scalp reduction surgery -- surrounded by a furry circle of hair around the sides and front, from which all ends are drawn up to meet in the center and then swept back and secured by a stiffening spray. The color, she would point out to comical effect, was from a product called Just for Men -- the longer it was left on, the darker it got. Impatience resulted in Trump's orange-blond hair color."

And the residents of those areas look down on Sacramento as they do the entirety of the central valley, despite Sacramento\'s demographics and culture being closer to the megalopolis side of the spectrum. So we\'re always looking for any opportunity to distinguish ourselves from the likes of Fresno, Stockton, or Yuba City.\n\n\nEven most of the people here buy into it; I constantly hear people talk about Sac as a great place to *live* because "it\'s 90 minutes from everything you could want: The mountains to the east, SF to the west, Napa & wine country northwest, Santa-Cruz beaches southwest and only a couple hours from Yosemite." But it\'s never described as a great place to *visit*.'

"There is every indication that if Trump nominates someone like Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin himself to Kennedy's seat (there is no law barring this and there is also no law keeping him from serving concurrently as President of the Russian Federation and a Supreme Court of the United States justice), then Mitch McTurtle will go nuclear to push the nomination through anyway.

"I just love how they want us to believe that as the head of justice he can't obstruct justice. Even if he is the target. \n\nNext I am waiting for his legal team to put forth the proclamation that as president it isn't even possible for him to commit a crime. "
"Yeah don't people get how this works?? The NEXT president will pardon Trump, making sure he never faces charges. We learned a lot from Nixon"
"It's really easy to get around this though. Pence can pardon him. He just has to be president temporary by Trump invoking the 25th"
"I'm pretty sure that the whole point of Trump saying he can pardon himself is the same reason he tells any of his lies: to feed a twisted narrative to his base."
"It's about the SCOTUS, but there is an article in the Constitution that states a man must not act as a judge in a case in which he has an interest, it's one of the natural laws they base the Constitution on, if trump pardons himself, we will have a constitutional crisis that should not only lead to impeachment, but a reversal of the pardon, a Supreme Court ruling, and public outrage on a scale never before seen."
"I think if he tries to pardon Manafort it will necessitate and force the hand of the senate to bring it to an impeachment vote. Manafort's a pompous rich douchebag who is about to go to jail for 20 years. Think he will flip? He's about to squeal."
'Exactly. All this noise about self-pardon is an interesting Constitutional question and all but it’s just that, noise. Pence will do the pardon. One can only hope that TRump gets caught up in NYS offenses that do not fall under the Federal pardon system. And/or that Pence himself also gets indicted. And Nancy Pelosi is Speaker. Call it a dream scenario. Keep in mind tho that the Kochs are dropping half a billion into the midterms...'

Why is a sitting president of the United States having to say such a thing?  \n\nThis might sound crazy, but that kind of attitude has even Mueller skeptics wondering if these are truly the words of an innocent man."
'It’s not like if an impeachment+conviction happens, Roberts won’t swear-in Pence immediately, just as their constitutional duty would compel them to...\n\nThe military and Secret Service also swear oaths to uphold the *constitution* of the United States. One would hope, in a constitution usurpation-by-Cheeto scenario, that the military and SS would stand by their oaths and begin following orders in the new chain of command. \n\nA simple executive order from Pence, directing the SS to remove the Trumps from the White House premises would suffice at that point.\n\nThe concern shouldn’t be “whether or not Trump will resist”... the concern should be whether or not Congress has the jewels to do it. It’s a real possibility that 2018 could see the Blue-wave come up short of being able to impeach or convict and a 2020 election goes to Trump as well if more voter suppression and apathy holds strong. \n\nIf that happens, it’s still Congress who’s the problem... and Congress is a reflection of the people, even if skewed.\n\nIt’s almost as if *we the people* may not deserve anything better than what we’re collectively getting!'
'But there was never any surety there would be a Pardon, in fact it was part of a Grand bargain made between the Dem and GOP. \nAt the time of Watergate,Spiro Agnew, the VP resigned, so the VP spot was vacant. If it was not filled and Nixon resigned, the third in line, the Speaker of the House, Carl Albert, a Democrat from Oklahoma, would become President\n\nThis was just 14 months after Nixon had crushed George McGovern in a Landslide, so having a Dem take over the Presidency would not go over well with the GOP anf the Dems were afraid Nixon would stay and fight impeachment. To get Nixon out of office, the Dems agreed to approve Gerald Ford to be the Vice President, over the GOP choice, Nelson Rockefeller. \n\nWhile there was never a deal to Pardon Nixon, the fact that he would face numerous indictments, face a long trial and maybe  even Prison time. ford decided to pardon Nixon. It also killed any chance of Ford winning the next term, the pardon was really unpopular and Jimmy Cater won the Presidency over Ford in the next election.\n\nThere were many who said that Pence was picked to Pardon Trump, while pence is a politician, he has little ambition for the Presidency.'

And in 2018, the country will have a chance to make Congress Democratically-controlled.\n\nThere are large areas of the country where people are still not voting (see the thread about Texas); canvassing, registering people to vote, and actively engaging the electorate *does* make a difference.\n\nThe benefit we have is history; so long as we know it, and recognize it, we can work to not repeat it. People are more savvy, for instance, when it comes to crooked political administrations; Nixon taught us that corruption can go as high as the WH, and firing people investigating you (as Trump is now doing), is one of the surest signs. And now, papers like *The Washington Post* and *The New York Times* are hiring more investigative journalists and doing round-the-clock work, keeping tabs on the WH.\n\nDon't despair. :)"

'Tl;dr: someone else takes over the investigation, possible protests, possible Democrat political gains, a probable impeachment but probably not for a very long time.\n\nFor the longer version:\n\nBack during the Nixon Investigation there was an event called the "Saturday Night Massacre." Nixon wanted to fire the special prosecutor Archibald Cox, so he gave orders to the attorney general to do so. The attorney general resigned instead, as did the deputy attorney general. Eventually Nixon found a guy in the chain who would do what he asked, the solicitor general.\n\nFollowing that, for the first time polls showed that more Americans supported impeaching Nixon than opposed. Faith in the office of the presidency plummeted, and to this day Nixon is seen as proof of how far a crook can get in American politics. Most mark this as the official beginning of the end of Nixon\'s presidency (he resigned... 9 months later)\n\nThat\'s the historical precedent. Now for the Trump/Mueller situation specifically.\n\nIf Trump fires Mueller, he effectively admits that he is afraid of Mueller\'s findings. Likely a number (maybe not very many, but a few) officials will resign in protest. Further, it won\'t end the investigation, it just means someone else will have to be brought in.\n\nCurrently there are already local protests planned to take place across the country if Mueller is fired. This may cause a social and economic impact to the country, depends on how well Americans can be coordinated to protest and how much political will they have.\n\nRepublicans will have to weigh the costs of standing by Trump. Considering a Trump impeachment that also takes down Pence will allow for a Ryan presidency, the Republicans would have a self-interested motive to support impeachment. In all probability, they would continue to hold out for the results of the investigation. \n\nLong term, confidence in the American government takes a huge hit, both domestically and internationally. Honestly, that ship has already sailed, but this would be like soaking that ship in gasoline and then firing flaming arrows at it.\n\nNixon, in his case, got to stay president for 9 more months. Trump would probably be in a similar situation. The T_D crowd would insist that the God Emperor totally just drained the swamp of a deep state operative like Mueller. The anti-Trump crowd have already reached critical outrage, at this point they can\'t really get much angrier, and its not feasible for them to enter a perpetual state of protest. Whatever centrists still kind of like Trump would probably turn against him, which would do nothing to him but would likely help the Democrats gain seats in congress.\n\nAnd, maybe historically we will see that as the beginning of the end of Trump\'s presidency. But, I think history is going to decide that the beginning of the end was his inauguration.\n'

'I think she reminds a lot of people of the annoying, overbearing girl in high school who was in the National Honor Society and who was the captain of the debate team, who always had all the stats pertaining to every issue crunched out beforehand, and who seemed to think that everyone who didn\'t agree with her one-hundred percent was just a hopeless idiot.\n\nOn top of that, I think that deep down -- and whether for better or for worse -- that\'s *really who she is*. I think her innermost self was revealed when she came out with that health care plan back in 1993, during her husband\'s first term. She devised it in a vacuum and figured it all out on paper -- by crunching out all of the stats, of course -- and apparently, didn\'t see why it shouldn\'t just be rolled out and implemented the way she wrote it down.\n\nIn other words, she didn\'t want to start out conservatively by improving or expanding some existing structure and using that as a proof of concept for something larger, or by making a law or two that was aimed at remedying some particular and egregious problem, rather, she thought she should just be able to roll out an all-encompassing, sweeping reform of the health care system overnight because she had worked out the numbers, and they all seemed to make sense on paper.\n\nStill, I think that almost as many people don\'t like her simply because of what she represents as a woman who evidently doesn\'t personally accept the traditional roles that are assigned to women. By having a career and by seeming as though she derives her identity from that more than she derives her identity from her role as a wife or as a mother, she is a walking, breathing repudiation of many American people\'s value systems. She doesn\'t even need to mention anything about it specifically in order for some people to feel antagonized by her, and so when she says [things that might seem to even partially betray her hostility towards traditional ideas of womanhood](https://youtu.be/68OBqcON9o0), then that\'s all the confirmation that such people will ever need.\n\nTrump, on the other hand -- when placed beside her -- was more like a dumb, loud-mouthed, arrogant and entitled jock or would-be frat boy who didn\'t know shit about fuck, but who always knew the *exact right moment* to shout something like "SAN DIMAS HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL RULES!!!" in order to generate raucous cheers and thunderous applause.

It had something.\n\n>The special prosecutor took it, got indictments, and then in a time-honored practice which I’m fully familiar with — it exists largely in the drug area. If you get somebody in a conspiracy and get something against them, you can then tighten the screws, and they will begin to provide information in what you’re really interested in.\n\n>That seems to me to be what is happening here. **I’m not saying it’s illegitimate, but I think we ought to be very clear about these facts and what is happening.**\n\n"

'To translate the headline into an actual statement: \n\nTwo attorneys think it’s possible to indict trump. Not that it’s imminent or for certain, but that it’s legally possible. \n\nIf you want to get into the jurisprudence on all of this, and get a head start on the arguments that would spawn from such a move by Mueller, the left will be all for it and the right will say that the chief executive, whose role in government is to enforce the law, can’t be indicted. How could you enforce the law if you’re in prison?\n\nSome will agree with the right (looking at you Clarence) and most will not. It’ll go to the Supreme Court to be resolved. \n\nSome will argue under the guise of originalism that impeachment was the only remedy to get rid of a corrupt or criminal public official, while some will argue that the founders never intended for anyone to be above the law, and they’ll cite pre-constitution writings discussing how the revolution took place to get rid of a tyrant who thought he was above the law. \n\nIt will be the most significant Supreme Court case of our lifetimes and god forbid Trump gets to appoint another right wing judicial activist to the court any time soon. If you really want trump to be taken down, you need to hope for a democratic house and senate majority in 2019, or for Ginsburg and Kennedy to remain on the Court'
"I hope all this comes sooner than later. We've been waiting for an eternity. To be fair though, a standard week under Trump feels like 3 years.\n\nMy hope is that the length of time is due to the number of people that will fall.

Soooooo maybe a fuck ton of people are gunna get raped on this deal.\n\nI'd be so happy.

"Trump. Pence would be a run of the mill republican who might try to push through some weird social conservative shit, but he will still act within the confines of the law and our democracy. The damage Pence could accomplish is akin to that of George W. Bush.\n\nTrump is an outlier that we've never seen before in our lifetimes. He doesn't value democracy or even try to pander to it. Democracy is the government for the common man. Someone who is born into riches has no need for democracy. They can buy the best lawyers, the best health care, they can influence those in power. Not all people born into money devalue democracy, but Trump certainly does. He views it as a chore, a road block to getting things done quickly. Try and find one speech where Trump even mentions the word 'democracy.' I'm sure they're out there, I'm sure you could count on one hand the amount of times.\n\nSomeone who values western democracy and our institutions wouldn't attack the press, the FBI, the judiciary, the intelligence community. They wouldn't cozy up to foreign despots while handing 'bills' to our allies for perceived money owed. They wouldn't suggest taking people's guns and dealing with due process later.\n\nTrump is far more dangerous because if he had it his way he would be president for life. And when he died maybe Ivanka or Jared would take over. Then maybe Baron. And Baron's children. And when you throw someone like that into the most powerful position in the world during a time of extreme economic hardship between the great recession and increased automation taking jobs, people are less inclined to question him because 'he's getting stuff done.' Or at least that's the perception."
'Does anyone really trust the FBI to be truthful in answering questions about an active investigation? I would be disappointed in the FBI if they were truthful. "Trump is not under investigation" to me sounds like the FBI trying to get Trump to continue his self-incrimination.'

"The investigation is ongoing. A premature impeachment by Congress without the evidence that is being marshaled by Mueller is reckless. Mueller is thorough, meticulous even, deliberate, and is conducting a thorough investigation. This can't be rushed, unless we want a shoddy job done. We have 35 indictments so far, and a number of guilty pleas. This is Mueller setting up the board. He's lining up each piece of evidence, each witness, methodically, until he's ready to pull the trigger. Whatever he finds, rest assured he will build a rock solid case. Patience. The wheels of justice turn slowly. "

"If you're innocent and halfway smart, you comply as fully as you can with an investigation.

If you play your cards right, you may even get a bump in your approval. \n\nBut that's if you're innocent and halfway smart, not President Donald J. Trump. "

'That\'d have to be handled very delicately. You wouldn\'t want to demand a deadline too early nor have such a demand come directly from the President. If asked, the only thing the President should say is something like "I look forward to the conclusion of the investigation so that we may dedicate our attention entirely to the business of the nation," or direct them to White House counsel.\n\nAfter a month or two, it would be a good idea to have surrogates and party allies hitting those or similar talking points. Political pressure should negatively correlate public interest. As people begin to lose interest, the investigation can begin to be painted as a partisan waste of resources. \n\n'

I have become so pessimistic about them...  They even make excuses for all the guilty pleas and indictments ("oh, he was just a coffee boy"... or "he only worked for Trump for a couple of weeks)....  It\'s going to take an indictment against someone they heard of (Kushner, Trump Jr., etc) to get them to start thinking, "hmmm, well maybe"... in the meantime, they will think everything is a witchhunt because the "snowflake liberals can\'t accept that Trump won and Hillary lost"'

"Wasn't that Fox News's Ailes answer to Nixon resignation? That is, it's aimed to make sure that the next ultra crooked president won't need to face scrutiny and resignation by making his support stronger than ever, which in turn would make even some of GOP's fairer senators reluctant to go against Trump unless they truly want to sacrifice their career.\n\nAnd it's both working and not working. Trump's 38-41% support is stupidly high for such an insane public figure, in part thanks to Hannity and the other servile servants, but he actually only had like 18% of ultra strong support, which would've fit more in other country with pragmatic view of their leader like France. Most of the rest of 40% support would happily trash Trump if he sent USA straight into toilet via economy anxiety. And that's not even talking on how this whole never-ending shitstorm energized liberals and other sane people to the point that they already losing many seats, including the Alabama senate seat, which was thanks to the very angry black voters."
'It’s more than that. Honestly if it wasn’t Fox doing it... another network would be. Fox has discovered a truth: people want their beliefs and prejudices reaffirmed. A large majority of our country is consumed by extreme partisanship. Networks like Fox have discovered that their ratings are higher when they take extreme partisan opinions because they are more interesting to their viewers than the truth.\n\nI blame the ignorance of the audience. Fox is just giving them what they want.'

"So Mueller's team passed along a list of possible questions out of respect, and in confidence, and the WH leaked them?"
'It is as if these questions are no longer for the Special Counsel to put to the President of the United States, but for the People of the United States to put to their President.'
"Please don't downvote me into the ground thinking I am defending the man (Hint: I'm not).\n\nIt seems everyone has skimmed over the line:\n\n> The special counsel told Mr. Dowd in March that though the president’s conduct is under scrutiny, he is not a target of the investigation, meaning Mr. Mueller does not expect to charge him.\n\nErr... seems to be a big one, even if this has been stated before."
"Dear Media, \n\nRemember when you covered Trump during primaries because it was good for ratings and it boosted his visibility and subsequent victory? This not only has damaged our country but it's put your own fucking well-benig at risk. Now don't fuck up these investigations for ratings.\n\n<3 Lye"
'Like he would even be truthful '
'I heard the grammatical errors in the list had lead a former assistant of Mueller to believe the questions were made up and perhaps released on Trump\'s behalf to murky up the waters. I feel Trump\'s "Overload the bandwidth of the news cycle" approach to this is working quite effectively, given he is being pounded into the corner of 4 boxing rings at once and somehow has a decent approval rating, but given his tribal base is drinking straight from Trump\'s teet and since it is a single person providing the propaganda it\'s a lot easier for him to take the authoritarian lead while the echo chamber of allies verifies and makes true the propaganda with repetitive buzz word manipulation.'

'I am not a lawyer, but I suspect not.  They weren\'t destroying anything.  Rather, they were *probably* preparing to give an incomplete response to a subpoena or request to produce the e-mails.\n\nBut because Mueller never gave the request, we don\'t know the exact wording of what that request (or subpoena) would have said, thus, we can\'t specifically say that the Trump folks tried to hide anything.  (edit: that said, if members of the Trump circles/administration *actually discussed hiding stuff* (which they appear to be stupid enough to actually talk about) and Mueller has that via "wire taps", turned insiders or other means, then yes, that would be evidence of obstruction.)\n\nIt would have been interesting to see how Mueller\'s team would have approached such a request/subpoena.  To us on the outside (particularly on this sub), we infer that Mueller has many angles of likely criminal activity that they are investigating, most of which pass through the transition period/team, but the request/subpoena would have had to have some specific legal basis around which the request/demand would be framed.  It would have been interesting to see how they formed that to see what they are focusing on, and what they aren\'t tipping their hand on.\n\n(There\'s also the factor of FISA and other "wire tap" warrants, so there may be communications within the Trump folks that they have through that route, which they wouldn\'t need to request/subpoena in a circumstance like this.  They could potentially be intentionally not requesting some records (which they have through other channels) because the players here are stupid enough to think they are succeeding in covering stuff up.)'

It's far more palatable for people to believe that Trump and Bannon are these brilliant chess players making strategic moves since at least then there's less shame since, hey, they were these masterminds. \n\nPeople like to believe that we have this really strong democracy and it would take some comic book level genius supervillains to subvert it, but the truth is a reality TV star with a string of failed businesses and a white nationalist website owner did it and got raucous applause while they did."

'Despite the moneyed empowerment the GOP gives Nunes, I would like to think that criminal statutes will overcome this and that he gets prosecuted for obstruction of justice for the way he refused to investigate, manufactured pointless conspiracies and has been the pipeline of information to Trump of otherwise classified information. Surely the rule of law reaches over the politics of deceit and constitutional obstruction. If not, what is left to the once revered concept of good government?'

"He's favored pretty heavily favored out here. I'd be surprised if he got unseated. "
"I know Andrew Janz is running against him, but I'd like to know what the race is looking like too."
"He and a number of House Republicans were likely compromised previous to the Trump candidacy.  The House and Senate Congressional campaign committees have at least $7.35 million in raised and spent money that was distributed to Nunes and others Rs that got laundered through a Russian American.\n\nThere's also post-Trump candidacy contributions that was laundered money through the NRA from Russian oligarchs.  \n\nTo be clear, any money or in-kind contributions (services, material donations) by a foreign agent to a federal, state, or local campaign is illegal.  An example of an in-kind contribution would be the research, set up, and operation of a troll farm for the covert support of a candidate or a third party hacker similar to a WikiLeaks that asks say, Russian intermediaries, to meet with the staff of a favored campaign to let them know they had the goods on their opposition."
'[So long, days of yore.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/mueller-pick-achieves-a-rare-bipartisan-consensus/527133/)\n\n> Republicans joined in the parade of praise for Mueller, undoubtedly relieved that Rosenstein’s decision would lift at least part of Trump’s political burden from their shoulders. GOP lawmakers have been hounded by reporters in recent days seeking their reactions to the latest bombshell media reports, and Mueller’s appointment allows them to defer to an investigation that now has bipartisan credibility. Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, called Mueller “a great selection” with “impeccable credentials.” Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said the former FBI chief “has a strong reputation for independence, and comes with the right credentials for this job.” Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado said Mueller had “an incredible reputation.” “It’s the right decision,” he said Thursday morning at an event hosted by The Atlantic. “Let’s get the facts, let’s get the information, and let us proceed with all haste.”\n\nWhat a change of tune. '
"Mueller will do his job, and nothing more.\n\nPartisan bullshit will not affect him doing what he must... but it will affect how some view his work. Voters have to act because there are already those who are trying to make this look like some grand anti-conservative conspiracy. The reality is it's government checking and balancing. We are in the midst of a constitutional crisis, so we must take the side of law and order. You have to punish individuals at the voting booth because grand Anti-GOP language will embolden propaganda outlets.\n\nWe look to Mueller not because he is liberal, or a champion for democracy, or a counter to Trumpism. We look to Mueller because he best represents the law. He is already one of the best lawmen in our nation's history, and this is one more task he is undertaking. Regardless what the outcome is, we must respect his teams findings.\n\nConstitution first, all else afterwards."
"Excuse my millering this thread, but what in the world is with the radio silence regarding the purported meeting between Trump's lawyers and Mueller's team? Did a meeting take place? When?\n\nAnd, most curious of all, why has the media been totally silent after so much was written about the meeting during the **days before**? "
"Honest question: Have Trump and other Repubs done anything other than tweet or comment to the press about Mueller? How does having an opinion undermine anything from a legal perspective? Also, I thought Trump couldn't fire Mueller, just the guy who appointed him."
'What consequences? The title leads one to believe there is an argument for consequences to be levied on people who are "crusading" against Muellerin a so-called partisan attack but the article doesn\'t address this idea at all. There is, however, a lot of the "pot calling the kettle black" and obsequious fawning over Mueller in the article written by a sycophant. (It\'s getting so over-the-top I bet I could hang a "ice cream machine" sign over his ass and people would still buy it and eat it up.) Trump won\'t fire Mueller, he\'s not even building up to it, he doesn\'t need to. You may wish and hope he does so you can fulfill your "obstruction of justice" fantasy, but that\'s not what will happen here. '

It was necessary to act as a honeypot so as to fully root it all out. This is what I meant by draining the swamp. And to my supporters, I would just like to say \'if you were really on board with this you need to get some help, here\'s a number to call ...\'"\n\nI mean ... that\'s is *supposed* to be a believable thing for the American president in a completely fucked up situation like this. Right? That\'s *supposed to be who the president is*\n\nIt\'s so devistating to know beyond a shadow of a doubt that absolutely nothing of the sort is the case. Trump, and his entire administration and pretty much all of the GOP leadership led us like lambs to the slaughter and give zero fucks about that. Even after they plead guilty. They will still give zero fucks.'
"Fox was just waiting there for a juicy story to endlessly discuss and the Justice department gave them one with the FBI text messages released. Now the same department releases more emails from the Wiener investigation laptop hoping it will stir more discussions. I don't really understand why they feel releasing these partial pieces of an smear are doing anything helpful. If you're not going to investigate with the things you release and you're not releasing any statements with reasons on why you're releasing them, you're just causing a ruckus. \n\nI don't think Mueller's team can go on for more than three months more if they keep releasing smear evidence and don't get scrutinized for why they release this stuff.  "
'Good on you.\n\nEven if you 100% support Trump you should never be against a professional like Mueller investigating him. If Trump is clean then nothing will come up.'
'The “fake” dossier was actually legal opposition research. Yes you read that right Russian trolls, legal document just like don jr was setting up meetings looking for “dirt” on Hillary. Was that illegal too? Also despite the fact that the fbi was investigating the trump campaign 6 months or more before the dossier was even reported. \n\nHell trump knew about the Russian interference because the FBI TOLD him and his campaign way before the dossier.

'Oh my fucking word, please be true'
"Well, we know that Trump can only pardon Cohen for federal crimes. We also know that Mueller has some amount of sway with the State of New York's AG office. I think we can safely assume that Cohen's been up to shady business that probably constitutes some state crimes. So . . . if you're Michael Cohen, you have two choices:\n\n1) Hope notoriously self-centered backstabber Donald Trump swoops in to save you from federal criminal charges. This will not save you from state criminal charges and it will not save you from being subpoenaed by Mueller or Congress to answer for your role in those federal crimes.\n\n2) Throw yourself on the mercy of Robert Mueller and beg for as much immunity as he can possibly give you. This is your best chance to avoid any jail time whatsoever.\n\nThe choice is pretty easy if you ask me."
'Hopefully Cohen is wearing a wire from Mueller when he listens to the offers from Trump. That would be perfect. "Look Cohen, just don\'t say anything to Mueller and I\'ll take care of everything."'
"Just you wait, Trump will pull his 4D chess moves. Maybe he'll be safer locked up when the bombs drop, perhaps it'll guarentee he dosen't do any military service (despite being 72) in any capacity and make him a low priority target.\n\n\nWhen the people of America crawl out the ashes of their once great country they will have no choice but to exonerate him as supreme leader eternal\n\nEDIT: I seriously underestimated the age of the soon to be supreme leader."
"We don't care if Cohen talks, because Trump did nothing wrong, so this investigation should be shut down immediately!  By following long and poorly concealed chains of evidence, Mueller has sprawled way too far beyond his original mandate to investigate evidence!  This man who never talks to the press is only doing this for publicity!\n\nDoublethink is fun"

'That was the old Ecuadorean demand. It has changed and they have not listed that as a demand and are preparing to remove his asylum & sanctuary at the Embassy. the reason? Ecuador has a new President, and the US has threatened to oppose a new World Bank loan to Ecuador that they really need. A majority of the funding banks of the World Bank are in the US, and if thye do not participate and it had to go elsewhere to other banks the loan would have a lot more interest. So money talks and Assange walks. But actually if Assange had to go to the US, now is his best time, as he now has a large bargaining chip; what he knows about the Russian use of Wikileaks and his communications with the Trump campaign, the Russian GRU and, of course, the "off the books" people helping both parties. This alone is liable to give Assange a walk if he cooperates with Mueller\'s investigation.'

This post was only mean’t to express my personal hope that slimeball Farage (who is certainly in the mix here) gets his comeuppance too, or at least that he is worrying about getting it. This thread does seemed to have veered into Assange bashing and speculation as to his involvement in this whole affair. My personal feeling on Assange is that maybe he started off wanting to leak info for honest/good faith purposes but it’s pretty obvious now he has been working for the Kremlin. Why no WikiLeaks about Putin’s dirty laundry? No only leak info damaging to Western Democracies, because that’s how you’ll change things for the better 🤔'

You can prove an explicit quid pro quo, [but if it is not an "official act" it still isnt considered bribery](https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-supreme-courts-bribery-blessing-mcdonnell-decision).\n\n>Technically, the Court held that selling an “official act” can be still illegal. But it also held that the McDonnell jury heard a definition of that term that was too broad. **Something as subtle—or unsubtle—as an executive calling up an aide and telling her to listen to his very good friend, or taking a check and then having a quiet word with regulators, or even a directive that an influence-buyer should be helped in every way does not constitute an official act, at least not on its own, the Court found.** Instead, according to the opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts, an official act "must involve a formal exercise of governmental power that is similar in nature to a lawsuit before a court, a determination before an agency, or a hearing before a committee.” In other words, if no gavel is involved, it will probably be hard to prove bribery, after this ruling. Indeed, the few politicians whom prosecutors may be able to convict are those who are careless enough to put together corruption to-do lists, since, according Roberts, a test of whether something is a bribable official act is whether it is "the kind of thing that can be put on an agenda, tracked for progress, and then checked off as complete."\n\n'

"Although the photos are difficult to make out, the bald man could potentially be Ahmed Al-Rumaihi. A former Qatari diplomat, who heads up part of a Qatari Investment Authority in the US, and may possibly have connections with the Royal family. This is where things go from downright bizarre to interesting.   \n\n* Last month Ice Cube and a business partner filed litigation against Al-Rumaihi and other defendants, over fallout from investment in their a sports venture. The filing is in Avenatti's hometown of LA.\n* The substance of the case has nothing to do with politics - there are some interesting topics raised in the court filings however.  \n* It's alleged that Al-Rumaihi and the QIA is a front for a PR influence campaign directed on the behalf of the Qatari government. That this specific investment, amongst others known, were for the purposes of raising a more positive image of Qatar in the US.\n* One of the sports league founders (Jeff Kwatinetz) worked with Steve Bannon in a previous career. This is publicly available knowledge according to him. Kwatinetz claims they are still friends, despite having differing political views.\n* Kwatinetz claims that during their deals, Al-Rumaihi *repeatedly* asked him to set up a meeting between Bannon, Al-Rumaihi, the Qatari government. Al-Rumaihi allegedly said that they would underwrite all of Bannon's political efforts in return for his support of Qatar.\n* Kwatinetz stated he rebuffed this, and court filings document the reply as: *'Mr. Al Rumaihi laughed and then stated to me that I shouldn't be naive, that so many Washington politicians take our money, and stated 'do you think Flynn turned down our money?’'*\n* Note that Avenatti made effort to ensure Flynn was pictured here.\n* Note also the extensive allegations of foreign and corporate money ending up in Michael Cohens supposed slush fund.\n* If this is indeed Al-Rumaihi photographed at Trump Tower, that would be months before any of the above occurred. Subsequently, Mike Flynn would be fired. Trump would veer towards the Saudis. The blockade becomes increasingly strenuous for the Qataris. They need a new man on the inside of the Trump White House to be their advocate, someone like Bannon.\n* The coincidences don't stop here.\n* In one particularly tense moment, Kwatinetz claims Al-Rumaihi threatened him, saying 'You don't know who I know in LA and what they're capable of'. \n* In November 2017 the New Yorker broke the story that Harvey Weinstein used private israeli intelligence agency Black Cube to suppress allegations that he had sexually harassed or assaulted numerous women.\n* Last week The Guardian broke the story that people associated with the Trump campaign used 'an Israeli private intelligence agency' to smear Obama officials involved with the Iran nuclear deal. \n* The Qatar Investment Authority owned Miramax films, a company started by Harvey Weinstein and his brother.  \n* In December 2013, Miramax and the Weinstein Company signed a 20-year deal for future cooperation.\n\nPhotos of Ahmed Al-Rumaihi can be found [here](http://tmz.vo.llnwd.net/o28/newsdesk/tmz_documents/2018.04.05%20Final%20Complaint.pdf) in the court filing.

Yes there were payments, just not specifically payback for Stormy Daniels. Because he never did that.\n\n 2. Trump really doesn't have much cash on hand, despite the fact that he paid $400million **in cash** in the last 10 years, for some dodgy real estate deals, like the 2 golf courses in Europe for which he already had to pay $100million extra just to keep them afloat. That seems to imply that Trump really is incapable to properly manage his money. \n\n 3. This slush fund serves just to pay for things that Trump needs to pay for, but which the world should never have found out about, like hush money. Thus: Stormy Daniels  was not an exception, but the rule."
'Not defending these corrupt assholes but if you have lots of money, it’s not in cash. Their net worth is tied up in investments. Having cash = losing money because of inflation. Selling investments to pay off a lump sum would often involve taxes and missed investment gains, so leveraging debt can actually make you more money vs paying a lump sum of cash. A mortgage has a low interest rate, and anyone can make 7% after inflation in the stock market. So if you had a $100k cash and a $100k mortgage at 4% it’s actually better to keep paying the mortgage over time and invest the cash. You’ll offset the cost of your mortgage interest and profit with the rest. '

And maybe his point was that the propaganda is more heavily influencing the right, I’m not sure. The core of the topic at that point in the show, though, was that there is not a single set of facts that everybody is working from. Every news outlet has a different take, and headlines are so influential nowadays that it has become a problem.'
"The advantage of getting him in a meeting with investigators is they have the ability to use the information a bit more broadly, and use it to lay traps - basically, you have more time to use it (not to mention a cooperative witness is much more appealing than a hostile one). When you drag someone in front of a Grand Jury, you're forcing them to testify on the record. Worse, Bannon can't plead anything but the 5th in front of a GJ - the chance of getting caught in a lie is far higher (and with much higher consequences) in front of a GJ.\n\nOf course, he can still be dragged in front of a GJ and forced to give the same testimony.

Most hotels had a room that the KGB used to question guests.  A quasi-famous real-estate mogul from NY, that's married a Czech former-model, would most certainly received an approach.  For a man like Turmp, a little flattery probably went a long, long way."
'Read "Collusion" by Luke Harding. It\'s quite clear that Russia has been actively perusing Trump since the 80s at least. They potentially have compromat dating back decades. There\'s not much of a question at this point.'
'Then he succeeded admirably. '
"What if people just accepted that Trump was elected President despite the fact the Trump is an idiot (and also ignorant) and stopped acting as if he is a Super spy just because it suits your political cause? \n\nRussia didn't cause the problems in your country... It is very typical that US citizens, including democrats, blame foreigners for their own problems.  Also, your countries' problems existed long before Trump. Start looking in the mirror, President Trump is a reflection of your society. \n\n"
'"Those Soviet Union people said they liked my suit. One day when im too fucking old i\'ll  become US President and be a god damn Nazi so I can tear down this stupid fucking country. It\'ll be great. You should see it. Wonderful people."'
'If only he were putting it out there in a more coherent, reputable, long-form medium than Twitter. I’m not saying he’s not doing God’s work, it’s just there have got to be either more efficient or more effective ways of spreading the Gospel.'
"I'm pretty sure that when it's time for all the books to be written on this, he'll only have to sew together his tweet threads, and he'll be one of the fist to market. Until then, 1) There is no real motivation for him to dole it out in larger pieces 2) Tweeting is a very convenient and easily digestible format for a fast moving story. "
"Came here to say this. Very interesting read and well researched. The book doesn't make any accusations or connections just presents the facts as they are and lets the reader draw their own conclusions. From what I have read Trump is an asset and he doesn't even realise it."
"**Foundations of Geopolitics**\n\nThe Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia is a geopolitical book by Aleksandr Dugin. The book has had a large influence within the Russian military, police, and foreign policy elites and it has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Its publication in 1997 was well-received in Russia and powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian fascist and nationalist who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.Dugin credits General Nikolai Klokotov of the Academy of the General Staff as co-author and main inspiration, though Klokotov denies this. Colonel General Leonid Ivashov, head of the International Department of the Russian Ministry of Defence, helped draft the book.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28"
"Thank you, exactly this. The thing about these sort of operations is that, relative to nuclear submarines or spy satellites, the shit is cheap.

"My dad works in the government and he got ahold of the memo for me:\n\n1) Mueller is a poopyhead\n\n2) Mueller admitted to unknown but very very reliable, really just the best, sources that he is a traitor\n\n3) Russia said they didn't do anything and they didn't because they are a great country and putin is a great friend and ally to all republica... Americans.\n\n4) Trump is obviously a great president; have you seen how much money rich people are making now?"

Take that, solar babies."

"Mueller truly is a hero in all sense of the word. To be able to do such a great and thorough job when the odds are stacked against you from nefarious sources. He is truly underappreciated in his pursuit of Justice. He's definitely someone I will tell my son about in great detail as a lesson of when to do the right thing even if it may not be popular. "

"Well, hes not a criminal Target in the investigation, so there's some truth to what he's saying"

Trump is still under investigation and they can announce criminal charges when they're ready."
"Honestly we all need to be educating Fox News viewers with FACTS through Fox News' social media pages like Facebook and Twitter!!!! Trump has to be stopped!!! It's Fox News who is responsible for spreading the brainwashing."
"Her ties go through Russian businessmen moving to israel for Israeli citizenship. Both russia and America have a no extradition clause for Israel. Given Israel's desire for funding and business their tax codes promote these Russians to go there. Since America doesn't make AIPAC and its offshoots that bleed into the NRA, some having the same boards and members, register as foreign agents or prove the money didn't come from Israel, Russians can dump money into trumps pocket unchecked. Russia is using Israel to get to us and the NRA is happy to oblige. \n\n>In an effort to attract successful people and their money, the authorities took a no-questions-asked attitude to the source of the funds. More recently, the success of Israeli technology companies has also made the country a viable destination for legitimate investment. The oligarchs, for their part, have increasingly sought out potential boltholes in case they fall out with the government back home.\n\n>\nBesides the warm welcome from officialdom, another of Israel’s attractions for the oligarchs is physical security. Many of them travel the world with bodyguards, looking over their shoulders for hit-men or polonium in their tea. It is never referred to publicly, but there is an understanding that Russia’s intelligence services do not challenge their Israeli counterparts by carrying out hits in Israel. “There haven’t been any assassinations here, that’s enough,” was all one senior official would say.\n\n>\nIsraeli law-enforcement officials have raised concerns that lax tax rules have created a pipeline for money-laundering. Last month the finance ministry tried to convince the cabinet to adopt its proposal to cancel a ten-year exemption from reporting foreign income and assets that immigrants and returning Israeli expatriates enjoy. (They would still have been exempted from paying tax on their foreign income.) The immigration minister, Ze’ev Elkin, blocked the plan. He insists that the exemption is not there to attract the oligarchs, who have their pick of friendly tax jurisdictions elsewhere.\n\nhttps://www.economist.com/business/2015/09/17/welcome-to-the-promised-land"
"Oh please sweet Jesus let them go down in flames already! When I worked at Infocision in the political department selling NRA memberships and asking for donations to them as well, it was just so slimy and wrong. I couldn't do it, conning little old ladies out of their money to go to the NRA, and the scripts were insane(and were written with help and approval of the client). After the shootings in Parkland and Vegas, that was the line and I quit. Best decision I've ever made for my mental well-being. Fuck that place, I wonder how much they pull in for the NRA every year. I worked in the office at one point and learned that 80% of Infocisions income is from the NRA. Crazy."
"NRA loves running their mouths...if they aren't commenting you know its BAD!"
'Give the Fresh Air episode a listen. Was put up today, if NRA took money from Russia through a third party it might be traceable to the Trump campaign. That’s truly disturbing.'
'Is it the same reason why the Obama Justice Department never explained the special permission the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. was granted to be in the United States for an apparently indeterminate period of time?'
'Happy cake day!'
'The NRA is also a tax-exempt non-profit, granted the status because they are a "social welfare organization".\n\nSocial welfare organization = "To be operated exclusively to promote social welfare, an organization must operate primarily to further the common good and general welfare of the people of the community (such as by bringing about civic betterment and social improvements.)"'
"Shit, the NRA used to be a champion of rights, they have a positive history with the Civil Rights Movement, but shit changes. I hear all these folks talk about who the NRA was, and that's why they still support them. Well shit changes yeah? Jerry Sandusky used to have supporters because he was a great football coach, well, shit changes."
'"speak or write authoritatively about a topic." I\'m pretty sure I\'m good with discourse. They\'re encouraging people to take to social media to be argumentative twats.'
"That's exactly what I meant. Americans love AK's and Mosin-Nagant's.\n\nEdit: the ORSIS T-5000 is pretty badass too"
"The article says the nra officials met with the wife of the rich Russian that has vested financial interests in arms manufacturing. This rich Russian guy has ties to this suspected spy via an arms orginaisation in Russia. It doesn't appear that the nra officials have any direct contact with this suspected spy other than a donation made from the organization this suspected spy belongs to. Theres no direct link to any russian activity. Of course the nra wants contributions from this rich russian arms manufacturer. Im generally a liberal when it comes to most things but the right to bear arms is a fundamental liberty of our people and this artical looks like a blatant attempt to undermine that liberty by making this organization look like theyre directly associated with evil Russian boogeymen. Not saying I think the nra is perfect, but I don't think this has anything to do with them. It's more about getting the average American to become alienated with their most basic rights. Like, liberty is one of our most coveted values and lots of people are buying on to the idea that they should be restricted because their scared. That's the real Russian threat, make it look like your core values need to be restricted.  "
'That would definitely make the world a better place for the rest of us.'
'The leadership. And nationalize its offices to create a national service for firearms training and safe use of firearms, which is one of the only good things the NRA does'
'collusion is not treason. The law states that treason is when American citizen “levies war” against the government or gives “aid and comfort” to the nation’s enemies, and Russia is not technically an enemy of the United States. That means that charges of treason would not apply to this situation.\n\nedit: Collusion is not an actual criminal charge'
'It’s amazing, but right now, the only real threat to Putin on the face of this planet is Robert Mueller.\n\nWe all grew up watching movies, playing video games, and reading stories, in which the hero fights off great evil. It’s been an absurd preposition for a great long time that it was possible. People aren’t super human; soldiers die arbitrarily in war, police officers are prone to corruption and abuses of power, and good cops can die, and one could make a list of how many super heroes would really just die in real life.\n\nBut, here you have it: a man against the odds.\n\nIt’s amazing, but Mueller shows that the highest most powerful good humans do is this: the pursuit of truth.'
'Well, yeah! The whole "adoptions" thing was just putin flailing in retaliation to sanctions on his boiz. \n\nThe magnitsky sanctions are a big deal because if putin can\'t protect his cronies, do they really need him? Putin can\'t function without his cronies and knows this. '
'Have to rally and show the American people that we are absolutely in support of mueller and this criminal investigation. He and our intelligence community are our biggest hope for the preservation of our republic. God speed '

"There's a reason suddenly all these republicans are talking against mueller, and it's not to defend trump.\n\nThey know that if they start following money into GOP super pacs a ton of people can be implicated in congress.\n\nRemember that recording where they were all laughing about the russians. \n\nThis is all coming full circle."
'It’s more so like the all star superhero team of lawyers and investigators under the lead of Mueller, but I get what your saying.  Just wanna give credit to all those badasses '

'yeah OK there Mr. Year Old Account with Less Than 2 Weeks Worth of Posts/Comments and Over 75,000 Karma.   \n\nP.S - Have you considered legally shortening your name to something easier to remember, like Smith?'
"The adoption group is a facade, but this isn't new information ( except maybe mueller getting specifics on the sources of funding). This all was apparent back when kushner met with her and published his claims that she wasn't an agent of the Russian gov't and was interested in something about opening lines for U.S. to adopt Russian orphans. Trump, or his administration members will get there's, but it's not necessarily going to be quick and easy. I agree the headlines over hype it- my guess is to try and keep it in everyone's minds in case trump tries to quash it at some point, but who knows. "
"Russia has a lot of brilliant computer scientists and educate technological literacy pretty heavily. It's absolutely no surprise to me they run sophisticated subversion campaigns. I'm sure they are doing much more insiduous things than just this, and probably all around the world. It's not like it's difficult. At least compared to military or political strategies."
"Mass kompromization efforts have been successful.  It was a good move on Putin's part."

'Jack and crack! Honestly one of the best south parks episodes done in recent years.'
"What they may or have may not have done are probably pretty similar in seriousness. Just now we have one party that just doesn't care anymore.

'In many of these transactions, the deal was a "quick-turnaround" all-cash deal which is highly suspicious in places like New York or London. These transactions in many instances were also well above market value (some as much as 300k extra). Being a seller of a property which is being used for money laundering is itself not a crime, but knowing about the crime and actively covering it up using the property is certainly a crime. I\'d recommend reading the article, it has a lot of good info in it. '
"Honest question because I don't know anything about money laundering -- but isn't that just chump change in the grand scheme of things? We're talking not over a couple million for one of these units, how much money can you realistically launder in these scenarios?"
'Lol. Yes. (Real lol) Oh Lordy I Hope There Are Tapes!'
"I am also certainly very ignorant of all this as well, but these all are adding up (of which, are just what we know of because they have already been directly or indirectly incriminated in these court riceedings, let alone all of those we don't yet know about) to at least fairly substantial amounts. My, again, completely ignorant guess is that Trump then could, in turn, make purchases with his now apparently legit money in ways which are either yet unknown because he won't disclose his tax records, and because they could likely be transacted overseas through Lord knows how many Ruskie shell companies on foreign jurisdictions, returning the money to the Russians in exchange for, well, all of this horseshit thus far. Not to mention that Russians could have interests in the outcome of Trump’s many dismantling of laws which benefit large American companies which hope to benefit from the now captured entities making up American regulatory bodies. The Russians could be leveraging these law changes and monopolistic mergers being allowed to happen in the stock exchanges. \n\nIn short, Russia pays Trump dirty money to then either male apparently legit purchases in Russia in exchange for favors by Russia. Or, Russia benefits from backroom deals done with bought politicians and mega corporations which inflated stocks which benefits Russian spenders, in exchange for favors to Trump. Or all of this is continually done on the basis of blackmail for things Russia has on Trump. And/or because Trump is, too, laundering money the other way around in Russia in some sort of fucked up Ponzi scheme of corruption/blackmail/laundering going in continual circles. \n\nIn, even shorter, I still actually don’t have any idea but this much business with this many powerful people from a country which is already implicated in election tampering by a foreign country is shady as all fuckout and I don’t like it one bit but I have faith that our savior, the Mueller will collate it all eventually and I’lll live to see the first federally imprisoned ex-president and the first unilaterally reversed legislative record after the fact. By the way, I used to be a republican, this excuse for a president is literally turning party voters on their ear. "
'I\'m sorry, I wasn\'t clear when I brought up the amount of money laundered. I wasn\'t trying to say "Oh well it\'s just a few mill here and there, big deal." I\'m wondering if it\'s realistic to assume that he made all or most of his money from laundering with those transactions being only a couple million per transaction. I have no idea how someone gets the money clean, but I assumed if you were laundering money you would want to make it worth your time, and I also assumed that the bigger the transaction, the more money you can launder through said transaction without raising red flags. But I don\'t know the slightest thing about finance or money laundering so I\'m just speculating based off what I\'ve seen from movies and TV shows.'

'> Not a "Trumpian" but the flip side is, any other person on the planet would be in jail or have lost their security clearance had they handled classified material the way in which clinton and her team did.\n\nHere\'s the portion of the FBI investigation press release at the conclusion of the investigation dealing with their recommendation to the DoJ, emphasis added:\n\n> In our system, the prosecutors make the decisions about whether charges are appropriate based on evidence the FBI has helped collect. Although we don’t normally make public our recommendations to the prosecutors, we frequently make recommendations and engage in productive conversations with prosecutors about what resolution may be appropriate, given the evidence. In this case, given the importance of the matter, I think unusual transparency is in order.\n\n> Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before bringing charges. There are obvious considerations, like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent. Responsible decisions also consider the context of a person’s actions, and how similar situations have been handled in the past.\n\n> In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. **All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here.**\n\n> To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions. But that is not what we are deciding now.\n\n> As a result, although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case.\n\n> I know there will be intense public debate in the wake of this recommendation, as there was throughout this investigation. What I can assure the American people is that this investigation was done competently, honestly, and independently. No outside influence of any kind was brought to bear.\n\n> I know there were many opinions expressed by people who were not part of the investigation—including people in government—but none of that mattered to us. Opinions are irrelevant, and they were all uninformed by insight into our investigation, because we did the investigation the right way. Only facts matter, and the FBI found them here in an entirely apolitical and professional way. I couldn’t be prouder to be part of this organization.'

'I wouldn’t be surprised if the hostility being shown towards North Korea at this point causes Kim Jung Un to not visit the White House and turns that country away from seeking peace.

'Yep in the American Reich we use our old department stores as concentration camps. \n\nThis is just the beginning and it can only get worse from here. Now is the time to prepare for the possible future of defending life, liberty and justice. '
'Well, you’re talking about a president who refused to prepare for this meeting and the salutes a general of an enemy army. \n\nI’m not sure what you mean by “fuck it up severely” the same way trump doesn’t know what “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” means. I do think there’s almost zero chance of trump fucking up the cease fire but he’s so committed to calling this a win that he will undoubtedly say more nice things about Kim and undermine the sanctions in place against North Korea. He’ll probably fuck over South Korea (more than he already has) and create a world wide distrust of the American military as a stabilizing force in the world. \n\nSo, if South Korea can’t trust us and the North gets its economy moving and doesn’t draw down any of its military, who is South Korea going to look to for stability? \n\nChina\n\nIt’ll be interesting to see how this all unravels. '
'You\'re not screaming about "liburls" so I\'ll show the same courtesy here and discuss the issue instead of yelling and capslocking.\n\n\nNorth Korea is a huge problem, no sane person is going to argue that. The big problem here is the image of what he\'s doing. Take a look at the way past US presidents have treated the people and how our closest alies do the same. The president speaks as a leader, speaks to the people as a whole and even respects those who disagree. You have to do that, you\'re not the president of the republicans or the democrats, you\'re the president of the united states. A land where we support a person\'s right to free speech. \n\nTrump has not done that. He has actively waged war against free speech by calling news outlets that don\'t agree with him or paint him in the best light "fake news". This isn\'t someone claiming he had sex with his daughter, that could easily be called fake news. This is him attacking reporters with legitimate questions and concerns about his motives for how he operates. This is valid questioning of what and how he makes his decisions. He is intensely hostile towards critical questioning. Now lets look at obama and his relationship with the press. It wasn\'t perfect. When he made mistakes he took the beating. Look at the ACA rollout with the website. He went on Stewart\'s show and Stewart skewered him on live television, but he took it like a champ and admitted that mistakes were made and that they were trying to fix them. Trump would never do that. He would NEVER say he made a mistake, he even said "if I\'m wrong, I\'ll make an excuse" when asked about his statement that NK was not longer a threat. Its one thing to say that as a joke to a staff member or to a reporter that he has a friendly relationship with, but to say that as an official response to a serious question is not acceptable.\n\nNow, lets look at our ally\'s relationship with their leaders: All of them have similar relationships as traditional presidents have had. They support the press\' right to support or decry them. Look at Trump\'s relationship with them, he thinks they\'re weak he thinks they\'re leeches, he dislikes them and thinks he can bully them. Now look at his relationship with the dictator of NK and the defacto Tzar of russia (putin). He admires them. He speaks highly of them. This is where this picture in the OP becomes a problem. Trump decrys free press, he loathes opposition and he he actively adores two men with histories of brutal oppression of dissent. This isn\'t anything hidden or secret, its out in the open. He openly admits admiration for them and how [he wishes the US were more like their countries](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-north-korea-kim-jong-un-people-2018-6?r=UK&IR=T). It doesn\'t matter that he claims he was telling a joke, it matters that he said it.\n\nThe biggest idea that I can impart is that the words of a sitting US president MATTER. This isn\'t our crazy aunt posting links to conspiracy websites that we only see at thanksgiving and politely nod at while looking for a way to get the hell away from her. This is a person who has the power to use the military, to alter the relationships with foreign powers, to set the national tone and he\'s squandered it. Our closest friends have started to move away from us because of his *words*. Just words. This is a *very* bad thing and we need to rectify this quickly or the US will permanently loose its capacity to affect positive change in the world.\n\nYes, it\'s nice that he\'s trying to make friends with NK, but its coming at the cost of *everything* else.'
"As I said, I can see the hypocracy... I may be rather alone in thinking that it's better to give up some symbolics to get talks going, because isolating NK simply doesn't work...\n\nBy fucking it up severely I'm mostly thinking about how that guy doesn't realize how fragile diplomacy can be. He is already causing a lot of instability in the middle east by moving the embassy in Israel at the same time as withdrawing from the Iran nuke deal. Also how he's waging tradewars with long time allies as well as China.\n\nA true stable genius... So, I just hope that his interactions with NK doesn't in fact make the situation worse."

This was related several months ago and the Independents percentage is probably higher now. It was the conservative independents who voted for the McCains, Flakes and other Republicans now in office. \n\nIt is these same independents in many key states, not GOP or Dems who will actually make the decisions on who gets elected. Arizona voters were happy and liked both McCain and Flake, but there (were) are loud and persistent right wingers in the Phoenix Valley that supported Sheriff Joe, but even the republicans and Indpendents turned and voted him out of office. A few years ago, there were more Dems in the House from AZ, than republicans, but an onslaught of grey money flipped the seats. Reports/polls show they may flip back.

It was not until Nixon and the GOP gave in and suggested  Gerald Ford as a pick, would the Dems approve and a bargain was made. Within weeks of Gerald Ford being sworn in as VP, Nixon kept his part of the bargain and resigned. When it seemed that the Independent Persecutor would indict Nixon, after he left office.

"I had a dream last night that I had to set up the Interrogation Room (computers, desks, cameras, recorders) for Robert Mueller in center court at The University of Kansas' Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence Kansas. It was just he and I, and he was a pretty nice dude."
'Okay everyone. I want to have a brief bit of fun. Let\'s play the imagine game for one minute. \n\nImagine that morning. It\'s a Thursday. You wake up and your friend texts you, "Turn on the news."\n\nYou turn on the TV and skip past Fox "News" to a more reputable source and on the screen is Bobby "The Mole" Meuller, walking to a podium with a file. \n\nHe sits down and says "After concluding our investigation into the meddling of Russia in the 2016 election, and whether or not the Trump team colluded with the Russians, we HAVE found significant evidence and can confidently announce that we will be charging many members of the Trump team with a melody of charges including money laundering and obstruction of Justice. And I will confirm, President Donald Trump has been charged with money laundering AND obstruction of Justice. I will repeat that, Donald Trump is hereby charged with Obstruction of Justice and money laundering. That will be all. There will be no questions. Are there any questions?"\n\nCue the slow, maniacle Grinch grin appearing across all of our faces. \n\nAnd yes, I shamelessly gave a shoutour to the office. God I love that show. '
'I assumed he just really really loves Trump. That he probably promised him his loyalty due to his ineffective use of blue curtains '
"Playing devil's (literally) advocate here, but how do we know this is true? Snopes still has it as unproven that Nunes was present at this meeting."
'Trump is going to offer himself as a fat fucking stepladder, so Mueller can clean the top of the Grand Ole Pantry. '
'You know...I kind of hope in his final days before Mueller knocks on his door, he is given a choice: own up to it - all of it. And in doing so, protect your family from serious charges (Kushner not withstanding, he\'s on his own). And Donald, being the soft flaccid lump that he is, won\'t even hesitate to try and sell them out to save himself. Because he\'s never had to make a hard choice in his life, and wouldn\'t know how even if he wanted to. The idea of making a personal sacrifice to anyone, even family, is likely an alien concept to a man who is accustomed to taking whatever he wants.\n\nI really want all the MAGA\'s out there for be forced to witness as their "hero" betrays all oaths, even to his own blood, in a cowardly bid to stop the inevitable. I want them to have no place to hide from the truth of how poorly this man measures up. And I want him to sob like a bitch when he suddenly realizes there\'s no way out, and I want him to squeal like a pig when they find out who all else was involved in his treachery.\n\nThat\'s a lot of hopes & wants, but hey - a fella can dream of better days when things are looking grim.'
'First of all, just for the record, no one from California calls it Cali. Please understand California is a huge state with lots of political diversity despite its liberal reputation. Most of Fresno’s population votes in the 16th district and is suburban democrat and ethnically diverse. Nunes’ district, the 22nd, is Clovis, Tulare and Visalia, California. It’s a WASP nest, and republican/Trump land. While Visalia is a small city, its economy is rural agricultural based. Old white farm money built upon the backs of Mexican migrant labor. Basically the modern equivalent of southern plantation owners in the 1800’s. This is how/why Nunes was elected in the first place. If you want Nunes gone, this local mentality is the mountain that must be climbed. That’s why it is of the utmost importance for everyone in this district who values transparent democracy at the federal level, to register and vote him out in 2018. '
'Is there a way to know when Rohrabacher is definitely at his Orange County office and plan a protest with Russian flags and signs focused on this for more media attention?\n\nEdit: same with Nunes at his office?   Do they schedule office hours when they are definitely there? '
'Robert Mueller was so genial in your dream because he is so superior to all Trump supporters.'
'I wish I remembered my dreams more'
"i would love to see this. However sitting presidents aren't charged with crimes. He'll have to be impeached first and then charged. He'll just be pardoned like Nixon. I don't think this ends with Trump in prison. I hope I'm wrong and I hope they do charge him impeachment or not but I just don't see it. Unless we all show up in November. "

'I think it\'s a function of the power players catching up to the 24-hour news cycle, especially with the ubiquity of social media. Back in the olden days of 10-15 years ago, before our news cycle became what it is today, people would effectively bury the stories they did not like by arranging for them to be released late on a Friday. This was because, in old-school media consumption, people would primarily read the newspaper/listen to the radio/watch news TV in the mornings and possibly weekday evenings, and not consume nearly as much media from Friday PM through Sunday, and by the time everyone was paying attention again the story would have lost some bite.\n\nA trend in the opposite direction has now developed (and became abundantly clear in the 2016 election): people now release damaging stories about their "opposition" (for lack of a better word) on Fridays. The amount of reporting goes down over the weekend because the media is less active on weekends and is mostly restricted to analysis. As a result, the Friday stories dominate the news cycle all weekend, by way of both editorials/news-analysis shows and social media sharing.\n\nP.S. This is my personal theory on it, but I\'m pretty sure it\'s right. I should also say that it\'s hardly my own theory; just something that I\'ve seen discussed in various aspects that resonated with me.'

It is the art of identifying the plausible, and then portraying it as the logical. In short, people accuse you of “thinking like a lawyer” when you find a way to depict a given set of facts and law, in an accurate but deliberately emphasized fashion, so that the data compels a conclusion that has been pre-established by the lawyer."\n'

That's. Freakin'. Hilarious.  All I needed to do was google this issue and it unleashed a whole world of underground comedy and conspiracy websites with the most amazing of stories. Many put Alex Jones to shame. I made some bookmarks for future lolz.  Thanks for the comedy. :D\n\nI think people care if Trump had an affair in the same year his current wife was giving birth to his child, because it speaks to his character, as if we needed any further examples at this point. There's also the matter of lying about it, and how funds were expended to keep the matter quiet, with possible penalties ranging in an attorney losing his bar license, to breaking of campaign law, and possible imprisonment for parties involved.  Of course none of that will come to pass, but still... its a good reminder of what the person is like who won the Christian vote in the election. What a modern moral example for us all. XD"

"At least he makes himself not look like the obvious suspect. He says arrest who's guilty and find who's innocent. Trump and his followers decide to shift the blame onto some other politician (not on his administration or in support of him), such as Hillary. And acts like a six year old when they've been caught taking a cookie from a jar who's trying to say he didn't do it even though there are crumbs all over him.

"In the short term, that may have been true, just like not going after the Bush administration was less painful in the short term. Yet here we are with a president convinced he can get away with anything. It's worth short term harm IMO to remind everyone seeking the presidency, that you are the highest public servant in the land, and that Commander in Chief just means directing the military for the benefit of the citizens.\n\n\nEdit: seeking not selling, though..."
'Even at the start, Nixon was not exactly loved, especially by the media, and his ethical standards were not considered particularly high. However, he didn\'t seem to be out for personal enrichment-- it was power he was after.\n\nUnlike Trump, though, he thought deeply about policy and had some political skills to accomplish his goals in the face of a Democratic Congress. Domestically, he championed fairly liberal policies while at the same time sending out dog-whistles to "law and order" types and to those opposed to forced busing. In foreign policy, the area he liked the best, he took a hawkish stance in order to make grand bargains.\n\nHe was like those who would later be called neo-cons. He was a brilliant man of substance with a paranoid and unpleasant style. His personality defects would eventually cause his downfall.'
'I mean, there was definetly clear evidence of Nixon being Crook-y, the main difference is Nixon was a career politician and I personally I would argue he was one of the most qualified men to ever run for president.

"Deputy AG Rosenstein wouldn't allow Mueller's investigation to continue if there wasn't anything further the investigation could yield. The fact that those on the inside expect the case to last *at least* another year is presumably because there is a lot of evidence to go through. From my reading, the investigation is legally bound to follow through on all other criminal leads it falls upon. I'm no expert, but I suspect these types of cases at this high of a level tend to yield many other channels of wrongdoing that take time to investigate.\n\nTL;DR -- If anything, hearing that the investigation will take *at least* another year is good news for those hopeful that justice will prevail.

"I made these points a while ago, but without your careful elucidation of the relevant statutes. Kudo's!!\n\nBut what I would also like to point out that, while Giuliani made a big deal about Cohen's truthfulness and credibility as a witness, there is a better chance that Mueller will only need Cohen as corroboration. I do believe that Mueller has had information of Donald Sr's knowledge of Russian involvement including the Trump tower meeting long ago. Lets not forget that in that meeting in the Trump Tower between the Trump people and the Russians were a translator who does work for the US State Department and know every word that was said, but more importantly people who have left the Trump administration an are not covered by Executive privilege have been questioned by Mueller, including Hope Hicks. While Mueller knows that Manafort may hold several keys to the Trump campaigns involvement with Russia, what he knows is also shared with other people that Mueller has interviewed long ago.\n\nRight now Mueller is seeking to just corroborate information he already knows. The fact that Mueller of DOJ atty's have not even questioned Cohen and that Cohen has volunteered this information, is informative, it may well be that Mueller does not need Cohens testimony and a linchpin for his case. Cohen though, may hold the keys for several other misdeeds of the Trump campaign outside of Russia, that may be of interest to the DOJ. He can serve to corroborate what Mueller knows though.\n\nNeedless to say, your outline of Trumps legal problems, is just starting to resonate among legal pundits, now its just the witnesses and probative evidence the Mueller already has, to start another indictment process."
'Is Trump being accused of breaking 52 USC 30121, for receiving information from the Russians, in which the information would constitute something of value, defined as:\n\n> It shall be unlawful for a person to solicit, accept, or receive a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value, or to make an express or implied promise to make a contribution or donation, in connection with a Federal, State, or local election\n\n?'

'Ronny Jackson likely also falsified some evidence.

This is likely because these allegations are true with Trump tweeting they aren’t in order to sway the opinion of his major supporters. \n\nIn a few months or so an investigation will be done revealing this.

"It's literally EVERYWHERE!  My favorite part is that some of these tools make it easier for us to link custodians to criminal activity:\n\nExample: \nNEW: Send emails with obfuscated language covering up criminal activity.

Forensically collect them over the wire, due diligence, add to review.  Produce evidence.\n\nPROFIT!\n\nOLD: Forensically collect all relevant databases.  Create a new database with all relevant tables for the case.  Query the DB to pull information like additional custodians, access permissions, and data types.  Go collect those data types.

And they usually respond in the affirmative if you ask nicely.

His twitter feed is an official record, and the way he uses it is only going to serve to make the process of jailing him so much easier.\n\nWe would be done by now if there wasn't a GOP majority in the House and Senate.

'Yes, good observation!Keep Focused!! Don\'t underestimate the harm he can do to Trump. He is probably the only one that we know about, that can testify in open court, about "high crimes and misdemeanors" he has committed and those that had participation or foreknowledge by Donald Trump or a witness to comments made by the now siting President. Remember, Trump is legally liable for crimes he committed while not President, even those whose statutes of limitations have run out, if these crimes were purposely and deliberately hidden.Cohen was also a leg man for Trump, meeting people outside the campaign purview, but begs the question is "What did he do?" There is anecdotal evidence he may have been a connection to Russian intelligence or the Russian hackers, if not, then other people that even the Trump campaign felt were too toxic for anyone "in" the campaign to meet with.\n\nI think Cohen feels he has information that is important enough to keep him out of jail, (for his family, of course )and has seen Mueller\'s handling of an unrepentant and uncooperative Manafort.'

"I've been thinking since Trump meeting with Kim that this whole situation feels like the aligning of forces for ww3. The whole Trump verse Kim of the past few months was a show.... Trump is too stupid and is definitely Putin's pawn. Now Trump, Kim and Xi all meeting in Russia with Putin... The tariffs with China are a show too. Soon Trump will start pulling US trips out of the South China Sea, begin drawing down troops in South Korea and find away to back out of NATO. When the Muller investigation (s) begin showing their teeth at Trump, and it becomes clear Trump will be locked up, that's when sht will go down.

Word for word this translates as "Yes, I wanted that he won...".

I think Trump was involved, but what he said yesterday isn\'t an admission of that.\n\nAnyone can tell a lawyer "Do what you think is best" and turn the lawyer loose to take care of stuff.

'The actual answer in the worlds of Gerald Ford: "The only honest answer is that an impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers [it] to be at a given moment in history; "\n\nThe constitution requires conviction for "High Crimes and Misdemeanors" for impeachment.  This does not include incompetence, so by a strict reading you cannot impeach a president for incompetence.\n\nHowever, there\'s no check on the House\'s power to define what a "high crime and misdemeanor is", so for practical purposes they can define it however they like and there\'s no real recourse.  \n\nFor instance, they could choose to impeach a president for getting an ugly pet dog.  That\'s not a high crime.  But there\'s no higher authority to appeal to, so there\'s nothing preventing the House from doing it anyway.  \n\nStepping away from the Trump investigation context, this is actually a pretty major constitutional flaw.  In the event of a conflict between the president and the houses of congress, there is *nothing* present in the constitution that would prevent Congress from impeaching for totally specious reasons.   \n\nIf Congress chose to routinely abuse it\'s impeachment powers, 2/3rds of both houses would be enough to permanently neuter the presidency.  Norms and conventions are all that prevent this from happening.\n\nI know this is a shitposting sub, but I find this pretty interesting if anyone actually cares.  While I hope Trump is impeached if the big M finds evidence of actual "high crimes", I\'m worried about the precedent another highly politicized impeachment would set if the Dems proceed without that evidence.'

'Trump policies are not limited to "America".  He has either opted not to lead as previous Presidents, or Disrupted long standing alliances and trade agreements in ways that have created a vacuum throughout the Western World .  \n\n\nMay, Macron and Merkel are trying to fill that vacuum, but they are in a fierce battle with Xi Jinping and Putin and growing nationalistic populism movements that are looking to destroy faith in institutions and democracy.\n\n\nI wish May, Macron and Merkel success, but when you look at Putin\'s impact on Brexit, Italy\'s new far right fascist regime and parts of the East Asian world that are all adopting less democratic policies while parroting the same Kremlin active measures to destroy trust in institutions, you can see that Trump has served well as Putin\'s useful idiot to destroy democratic values throughout Western Civilization.'

'Have a little faith in justice. I have those worries too but then I remember what I felt like this time last year. I really had no hope back then. But things are happening now.

He was still talking to the Russians while he was under house arrest. That takes a lot of balls. Honestly there’s no telling what he’s planning. I think he will flip eventually, just like all the rest. If he doesn’t flip, that doesn’t mean the rest of them will get away with their crimes. \n\nSo here’s to being cautiously optimistic. '
'He’ll be impeached in 2019. I’ve been saying this since last summer and I still believe it to be true. \n\nNow whether or not he’ll see charges and/or jail time I don’t know. But I think this is a time to set an example. Precedent needs to be set. If he has committed crimes then I hope authorities make an example of him. After all, I’d bet Trump can really make that bright orange jump suite work. '
'Correct. Yes I did but I\'ve also been following this investigation from the beginning so I\'m aware the nature of the crimes they\'re being charged with. Why exactly do you think Mueller is charging them with what most consider "low hanging fruit"? Why do you think Mueller is offering and accepting plea deals? These people know the details of Trump-Russia collusion and apparently after offering a few "Queen for a Day" and listening to what they know he feels their testimony would be useful to the overall investigation.'
'The fact that the evidence Mueller and his team has not yet been made public doesn’t mean evidence doesn’t exist or otherwise isn’t there. These financial crimes are “low hanging fruit” for the special counsel. This is a means (and so far an effective one) to encourage the target to cooperate with this investigation. So far the only one who’s been targeted with an indictment that hasn’t plead guilty and offered their cooperation is Manafort. We’ll see how much pressure he can withstand before he too falls in line. '
'I finally got some clarity on what could make people do this:\n\nYour average Trump supporter is not (yet) harmed by Trump or his policies, but they benefit from the community aspect of supporting him. It literally is cult-like. Each of their individual votes do not matter at all -  even if they actually cared about policy, they couldn\'t change it. So what is the incentive to disavow Trump? In their eyes, there is none. They benefit from the political community. They can display loyalty together, they can feel persecuted together, and they can feel united together.\n\nThis is their identity now. What incentive is there to dissent if it doesn\'t accomplish anything politically, and you lose your community? There needs to be incentive to "do the right thing."'

Instead they're sweating, scared and looking at a lifetime in jail, because they somehow decided that being among the richest and most powerful wasn't enough, and that the best way to get more money was to try and distort democracy. And then they sent emails and wrote columns and told people exactly what they were going to do. Then they did it. Soon they'll be in jail.\n\nThat's dumb. They're dumb for doing it.

"That may very well be, however, this subreddit isn't conducting the investigation. professionals are conducting the investigation, professionals who have served our country through thick and thin for the better part of 2 to 3 decades. These are people who don't wake up every day hoping to find crimes, but they do wake up every day to investigate crimes, because that is their job. These men and women aren't looking to topple America, nor are they looking to appease the political masses, if they wanted to do either they could have thrown a bunch of phony charges at trump and brought him to court already. they could have easily slapped him with something back during the campaign when the investigation started, and back when none of us knew it existed.\n\nBut they aren't doing that, they aren't erronously throwing charge after charge at trump. In fact, the Mueller investigation started, and all of its investigations have been specifically targeted towards potential crimes committed by Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort. \n\nThese two are tied to trump because they worked on his campaign, but there exists the very real possibility they were just rogue actors. Either way, we're all better off if these two are investigated thoroughly and put behind bars, *if* that happens to involve trump, so be it."
'Schiff is the anti-Trump.  He’s a brilliant guy (Stanford undergrad, Harvard Law), who has chosen to work in public service as a federal prosecutor.  He is in his 6th term in the House, so he understands the nuances of how the government works.  Anyone who has seen Schiff in interviews knows that he’s a cautious person who is even-tempered, and he chooses his words carefully because he understands the impact of his voice.  He is articulate and humble, and he leads not with bluster or threats, but rather with the power of his ideas.  \n\nIf he ever decides to run for President, I will gladly do whatever I can in my state to get him elected.  He would be the best person for the office in a post-Trump America.'
"I will welcome the day when a real conservative party arise in America. As far as i concerned, GOP's not real conservatism anymore. It's a bonker regressive party now."

"I respect why you feel the way you do, but the whole idea of being conservative is itself bonkers. We need to be constantly updating, improving, changing, getting better - the world is change, we are change, God is change. The very notion of conservative is flawed, and we are witnessing what backwardsness the fear and stagnancy of conservatism can breed. Jesus and America were o.g. liberal progressives. No more time for what doesn't work."
"Schiff has had pretty strong words for a while now, although he's always very measured."
'Nope. We love that obama got bin Laden without starting a war with Pakistan. \n\nRemember when Fox News was bitching about how Obama would pronounce Pakistan correctly? That’s probably why Republicans started a war with every country that wasn’t harboring bin Laden. '
"The good idea behind conservatism isn't to not change. It's to have gradual change rather than abrupt one. Very quick change without discussion will make some people scared at best and make your plans backfired at worst, like for example if you raise taxes immediately to get more money from the ultra rich without real planning, they may run away to another state or country instead. To make the best way to raise taxes for these rich is to hear from them or at least the saner riches, make some compromises, and make plans in case your plan will have some negative initial consequences regardless of their agreement.\n\nYou need many sides to make healthy counter arguments for your policies and discuss some middle roads, or else you'll scare the other side and make stuff cannot be negotiated. Hell, even if your idea's unarguably the good one, having someone from other side will help you to point out the flaws behind your idea (which's why there are pesky editors for creative works in the first place). The problem with Republican is that the huge chunk of them cannot be reasoned with  because all they care about is winning. Even people like me who think democrats being center-right is a bad generalization agreed that republicans are downright batshit insane."
'> The very notion of conservative is flawed\n\nTheoretically, conservatism should be about values -- you know real values  you cherish and strive for in yourself and in society as a whole, not a cheap excuse for greed and hate.\n\nLike Mr. Rogers.\n\n'
'As long as you have people who fear losing what they have earned, or what they were born into, you will have conservatives.\n\nAnd much as you might dislike it, there’s value in conservative thinking. It balances out the optimism and naïveté of liberalism.\n\nIt’s the difference between an 18 year old and a 80 year old. Both have their flaws, both have something to offer. The smart move is to listen to both and find the best middle ground.\n\nThat part about listening is the real key to it.'
'If the FBI was investigating something, then they had probable cause.  I trust law enforcement agencies in the United States.  \n\nThere is a multitude of prima facie evidence to suggest that Trump’s team was engaged in questionable conduct throughout the campaign - do you disagree?  '
'Obama didn’t invade Libya. The EU did and the US played a supporting part. That’s why we aren’t stuck in Libya right now. So, yes I give Obama a lot of credit for getting that right. '
"No, that view is just very reductive. Value conservatism postulating a set of values as guiding principle makes no statement about other philosophies. Liberalism focuses on liberty. Social-democracy on social equality and participation. That doesn't mean that value conservatives can't value liberty or equality or social-democrats have no values."

'Hell, even a good lawyer can see writing on the wall. If a plea deal gets them less time, that’s a win for the lawyer '
'Seems like a lot of angst for no reason. I agree he does have a nice jawline.'
'If the 47 wins of state house seats since Trump became president, some in very Red districts are an indication of a blue wave, then yes, I think Dems will take the Senate and possibly the house in 2018.'
"You're right. The good lawyer would know when to take the best deal on the table once he saw the case against his client.  Which is really what's going on here. Guilty plea deals don't happen unless a crime was committed."
'See my reply to the other poster:\n\nThe indictment against Manafort was Indictment B.  That means there exists an indictment A in the same Grand Jury case.  Indictment A must be a bigger fish than B, and there’s a very short list of who could be bigger than Manafort... Kushner, Don Jr., or Trump himself. \n\nLaw theorists have speculated it is most likely Trump, and that’s why it hasn’t been revealed who it is yet. Mueller knows it *may* be challenged whether a sitting president *can* be indicted. \n\nBasically, either the indictment can be issued (in which case Trump must face court) or Mueller will hand it (the indictment) over to Congress at the end of the investigation to recommend impeachment.\n\nIf Mueller chooses the first option, expect this to be challenged in the courts and to IMMEDIATELY escalate to a Supreme Court case (CAN a sitting president be indicted?).\n\nFun times.  Fun fun times.'
'https://www.justice.gov/file/1007271/download\n\nCheck out the cover page on the indictment.  There is a stamp that says Case: 1:17-cr-00201 — that’s the case number (aka docket number), followed by the judge’s name, followed by the date, followed by “Description: Indictment (B)”.  /u/simchat pointed this out (much to my delight and surprise, thx!). If the Manafort/Gates indictment is Indictment (B) within this case, there is also an Indictment (A), and simchat explained that the defendant in Indictment (A) is a bigger fish than the defendant in Indictment (B).  Simchat understands this better than I do, but it occurs to me that Indictment (A) could maybe be against Trump’s campaign as a legal entity, since I assume it was the principal to Manafort and Gates, who were agents of the campaign (I think?). I’m absolutely spitballing here, of course. \n\nAdditional fun fact, now that I’m down this rabbit hole — the van der Zwaan guilty plea is labelled Information (A) (an information is a different way of pressing charges than an indictment), and is labelled as related to 1:17-cr-00201 (the Manafort/Gates case).  Same judge, too. '
"I hope he achieves peace in the Middle East before the indictment, because he's totally qualified, right?!??"
'I’d love nothing more than to see Kushy in a jumpsuit. '
'He he\n\n>At least one firm, Mercury Public Affairs, passed up the opportunity to work with Kushner’s team, people familiar with the discussions said. Mercury’s lobbying work has also come under scrutiny by Mueller, which could have complicated its ability to represent Kushner.\n\n>Michael McKeon, a partner at Mercury, declined to comment. The firm, which has not been accused of wrongdoing by Mueller’s team, has said it is cooperating with investigators.'
'Pretty much anything he did could be pardoned by Trump. The task of PR people is to make that option seem palatable to the American people.'
'I’m sure he’s super-de-duper close to that peace accord. I mean, Trump already gave away a huge piece of leverage when he recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel without getting squat in return. That’s how this works, right?!?!'
'George Mitchell was on Pod Save the World about a month and a half ago or so. He said something like this:  \n  \n“I spent an entire career in public service, as senator and later special envoy to Northern Ireland. I helped broker the Good Friday Agreement and settle a conflict that was nearly a century long, and I took nearly five years to do it. Jared Kushner is 36 and has zero experience in international affairs nor diplomacy. He is apparently more qualified to take on the single most difficult diplomatic problem of our times based on the person he’s married to.”  \n  \nYou know the guy that wrote the Mitchell report on steroids in baseball too? This guy said that about Kushner and how that assignment is an insult to all diplomats working for the US. And further expanding on this, I truly believe Kushner is doing this as a direct favor for Sheldon Adelson, Trump’s other billionaire owner. Pushing the Jerusalem/Israeli settlements issue is a major goal for Adelson. This reeks of his grubby little fingers in the pie. '
'I laughed at that too, but it’s actually a pretty decent defense: dealing with media inquiries can be extremely time consuming, and it’s understandable that a lawyer could be too busy to do it all themselves. That’s why Flynn has what, 7 lawyers? '
"Mueller is prepared for such a thing. There are many, many precautions in place. There are already 30+ sealed indictments (perhaps more, if someone can correct me) that have already been filed with the grand jury. Moves have been made on the state level so that if Mueller is fired, he will just change roles and continue on. Things are WAY TOO far along for this thing to be stopped. Despite the crazies on the Right, Mueller has BROAD bipartisan support at many levels of the goverment. This thing can't be stopped by Trump firing someone. Doens't work that way. I think all this noise you are hearing is the Right trying to force Mueller's hand. They want to know what he is sitting on, or more likely, they know what he is sitting on and they need him to make it public so they can make their next move. Trust and believe in the Special Council. Trump and his fellow congressional turds can't just shut down the investigation, as much as they wish they could. "
"Oh sweetie.  Why don't you go back to your special place in r/The_Donald/ and let the grown-ups deal with reality."
' yeah it makes sense that in his situation, swaying public opinion could be beneficial. '
'That was easily my favorite comment. They have "passed up the opportunity" to represent kushner'

'Mueller is painting a masterpiece '
'I want to believe this, but coming from a creative writer at HuffPo... Still waiting on more definitive moves by Mueller. '
"this needs to end with him not just being impeached from office but ousted from the business world completely, he can't just walk out of the white house and back into the boardroom free to capitalize on everything he's set up for himself. he needs to be removed from everything and spend the rest of days in exile wearing ill fitting polyester suits he bought off the clearance rack after a long stint in an orange crotch-binding jumpsuit. all of the trumps. this will mean nothing if they can continue to exploit all the benefits and contacts they've managed to acquire while in office.\n\nas it is now they could get hot-stepped out of the white house like cartoon characters and they will still have won the lottery. finish him."
'I think that any of the folks on here who think they know anything thats going on are just full of hot air.    Ive been looking at this thread for a while and NOBODY said dick about 13 russians getting indicted before that happened  last week   “ oh what a masterpiece “. Mueller is a genius lol. Give me a break.  None of you have a clue where his investigation is really headed. And im sure ill be down voted but its true.  And btw even if he does find collusion with trumps team.  Trump still wont be impeached.   Bc thats not how the constitution works.  '
'He’s not exactly showing it. \nHe basically came out and said that these Russians he found were meddling. Nothing really on Trump himself. In fact they were doing not my president rallies as soon as he was elected and have been trying to get democrats elected for midterms.\n\n\nSo... yeah. I’m pretty sure I read that they think that the campaign was a flop as well. They blasted massive amounts of money and the best they got was a twitter account with an okay following.  '

'*Disasterpiece\n\n\nIt should never have come to this; the fact that all of this is coming out and STILL people will support Trump as the shining example of a true American is just sad.  In a short time, he has done so much damage, not just to our image internationally, but to the integrity of our political and justice systems at home. '
"On one hand, Mueller publishes his findings before the mid-terms. The republicans do nothing, and when the midterms happen everyone sees the party for what it is and it collapses. Alternately they do get off their rich, fat asses and do something and they maintain some veneer of integrity. \n\nOn the other hand, Mueller sits on what he has until after the mid-terms for a guaranteed immediate reaction. However, the backlash the Republican party so richly deserves won't be as severe in this case.\n\nIn either case, it's a win to some degree. Now we just need to sue Fox News into bankruptcy, and sanity will be restored."
'I\'ve noticed over the last year that your type of argument has evolved a bit:\n\n"There is no evidence Trump has anything to do with Russia"\n[proof of Trump being involved with Russia is provided]\n\n"There is no evidence anyone in Trump\'s campaign had any meetings with Russian officials"\n[proof of Trump\'s people having meetings with Russian officials]\n\n"There is no evidence anyone in Trump\'s campaign had any illegal meetings with Russian officials"\n[proof of Trump\'s people having illegal meetings with Russian officials]\n\n"There is no proof anyone in Trump\'s family were involved with these illegal meetings with Russian officials"\n[proof members of Trump\'s family have been involved with illegal meetings with Russian officials]\n\n"Russia did not meddle in the 2016 election"\n[Trump and Putin both admit it happened, along with literally all of our intelligence services/agencies]\n\nAll you\'re left with now is "Ok fine, all of those other things were true, but you can\'t prove Trump was in on it!"\n\nWhich of course, the odds of Trump not being in on it are rapidly approaching 0.0% every day.\n\nI hope whatever Rubles or Camel Cash or whatever you get for trolling is worth it.

His company might just gave an international reputation for being able to be abused for thus sort of thing and he's a complacent idiot taking his cut. \n\n Also the article mentions that the companies being based in Delaware is potentially suspicious for 'transparency'.

Public pressure could in theory convince 'real' (moderate? I dont know the rules anymore) republican reps to not cave and spew neocon rhetoric on trumps behalf to ensure their seats. It could keep general media from being so partisan that every story is a 'breaking news' on the investigation that isn't actually news and just takes air time and discussion time away from other issues. \n\nI personally think the parts I pointed out before don't necessarily lend credibility to the article that could help generate that support or sway the opinions of moderates, who I believe are the real people we need to be catering this news too.

"Not sure what is going on with this thread. I got hit with a broswer drive-by after clicking on the image that is hosted on Imgur.com. I was on the Imgur.com styled screen when it happened. It referred to me as a customer of my ISP (Comcast) asked me to update my flash player. It was pretty obvious it was a malicious/fake page. I know Imgur.com is cool, and I know Reddit is cool, but I also know Imgur has had security issues in the past. Not sure what is happening. I think someone (::cough:: Russia ::cough::) may want to try to retaliate against someone who posts opinions/information like this.

'Too real. I’ve sent articles to my friends who were Trump supporters, or more accurately just voted for him because he was Republican without educating themselves first. They never read them or make an effort to be informed, but when i tell them about things that Trump and his cohort have done they just say things like “i don’t believe that”. Their support for him is completely rooted in stubbornness and pride, and they won’t even try to look at the facts. I wish that they could see that it’s not about politically leaning right or left. It’s about not letting corrupt people get away with bullshit. '
'I wait for them to bring up Trump and when it gets to this point, and it always does, call them a coward. "You\'re not reading it because you know I\'m right and just don\'t want to admit it". be mean when they are pulling dumb shit like this, but nice when they are actual talking and thinking.  \n\nRemember they got conned and have some mix of not realizing it and not wanting to. Beating on Trump isn\'t effective because of the [backfire effect](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/). You need to slowly convince them that Trump has tried to pull a fast one and half the country fell for it but that doesn\'t make them idiots. They wanted a better life and Trump was selling more then anyone could actually offer. Was it transparent? Yeah but lots of people fell for it because he was \'on their team\'.'
'To be fair it is pretty long lmao'
'If he’s really a friend, explain it in clear, non-confrontational terms. “Trump said this, and did this, and these things are racist/bigoted/misogynistic/treasonous. When you support him and say you feel he’s awesome, it makes me worry that you agree with those things. And that’s not something I can stand idly by and be OK with. This isn’t a political disagreement anymore, it’s a disagreement over racism and hatred and treason—that’s not something I can ignore or agree to disagree on.”\n\nStick with verifiables: Trump did this, said that, supported this. Emphasize the difference between political disagreements and hatred: if you just disagree about tax policies or the minimum wage that’s one thing, but this is different and explain why.\n\nKeeping it in those terms has the best chance of getting through to your friend. Even if you don’t change a mind right away, maybe you’ll plant the seed that helps him see things in a new light. Some of the best mind-changing experiences I’ve had are the places where I said, “I don’t agree with that, but this person I like and respect feels differently: maybe I should re-evaluate.”'
'I think you’re on the right track and the right side of history.  I too have cut people from my life over this.  I don’t have any answers, just a hope that justice will prevail.'
'I have to ask for a little clarification. When you say he is a trump supporter do you mean that he is someone who drinks all of the Fox News, pro trump jizz, or is he someone who voted for trump because he didn’t like Hillary? Is he one of those MAGA racists who are too Fucking stupid to understand simple human decency, or is he someone who backed the wrong horse?\n\nI ask because I don’t want to rush to a conclusion about this person. You considered this person your work husband. That tells me that you know this person and you two were close friends. I’ll provide my suggestions for both options because you asked for suggestions, but if you were close with this person, but politics is the only reason why he is dead to you (he’s not racist, or anything it’s just he likes trump and you don’t) I think you shouldn’t let politics come between you. Ok here we go for the two options:\n\nOption 1: If he is in fact the stereotypical Trump supporter who thinks trump can do no wrong, refuses to see another side, down right hates any other opinion, hates immigrants, and brown people (the whole nine yards) I say fuck him. While it’s important to have friends with a wide range of view points if some are unable to humor the idea of someone having a different viewpoint drop them. That kind of toxic people can drain you, and suck the joy out of life. I can’t emphasize enough how even an email response isn’t with your time. He doesn’t deserve it. People like that being shame to this once great nation, and it breaks my heart to know that people like that live here and dare claim to be a patriot.\n\nOption 2: If he is not that stereotypical trump supporter and he is able to hear out different opinions I say talk to him. It’s good to have debates and hear out different viewpoints. It makes you a better person (I think at least), it gives you a tougher skin, and you will learn more about yourself.\n\nI apologize for the long post, but I wanted to offer the every option. The only reason I did this is because you were once close with this person.   \n\nPersonally I did something similar recently with some very old friends. They made a joke about rape, and I fucking ghosted them. I didn’t care, and after I felt amazing! They eventually reached out and asked what was wrong, and we talked. We aren’t close friends anymore, but we still occasionally talk. They are more like acquaintances. Either way you do what is best for you. I hope this helps, and thank you for reading.'
"One of my best friends proudly voted for Trump. Haven't spoken to him since. "
'I would do your best not to antagonise him because that will make him more resistant to change.'
'There’s a lot of hyperbole that gets thrown around when you talk politics. You can probably get through to him if you make it really simple, like: I can’t be friends with someone with bad values. By supporting trump, you’re telling me you’re the type of person who is indifferent to the suffering of Puerto Rican Americans, generalizes wildly about Muslims, and doesn’t mind a leader who calls white supremacists “very good people.” This isn’t normal, and I’m not going to normalize it by acting like I can respect you for supporting it.\n\n\nPs: wtf is a work husband? Like do other people have work soul mates?'
'Sorry for your situation.  If you want to create a framework that will allow you and your father to discuss issues important to you without having an ideological fight, I recommend choosing an issue and you each have to read and send 2 different stories about the topic to each other.  Then the discussion is about what you read.  This avoids lots of traps and completely avoids most of the bs stories that get run on Fox.  I think honest discussions are going to be the only way to repair what was broken.  Agreeing to not talk politics at Thanksgiving is accepting that you’re both too ideologically entrenched to even discuss current events.'
'Damn that sucks. I’ll be thinking of you. When this whole thing collapses post Mueller, which I believe it will, you will need to be there to help catch the parts of melting brain and to try and help put him back together again. It won’t be easy, and people need to be held accountable, but this must be done in an intelligent way. \n\n'

Our nation is truly great because you and many other men like you chose to serve."  But he didn\'t do that.  He literally pocketed the medal then gave us this quote instead.'

But I would rather have a slightly uncultured effective president over a well spoken puppet. \n\n"
'Actually he had "bone spurs". Several times, in fact. He didn\'t make something of himself, he was born rich. He went to my school, and alums talk about what a fucking moron he was, he was widely disliked. He is pretty clearly a stupid and petty man, I think everyone can agree on that. I wish him luck in "making America great again", hopefully he just does nothing and allows Obama\'s policies to continue fixing the economy.'
'1. Trump is definitely losing money. He is no where near as rich as he was when he began to run for presidency. Idk where you\'re getting this idea. Also you\'re going to need a source for that, but the Chinese investing in, and producing goods in America is a bad thing now? \n\n2. HES RACIST!! Isn\'t an argument. It\'s not a Muslim ban. It\'s a ban on dangerous people we don\'t want in this country. But yeah all the Muslims in North Korea are outraged at this ban, and all the Muslims in India are okay because he didn\'t ban India.... Because it\'s not a Muslim ban. \n\n3. This part is the funny hypocritical part. "He doesn\'t invite CNN to his press conferences boohoo. How will they report on it" and then you say to take away his Twitter?... The easiest and most direct way for him to say things should be taken away? And these news sources will show the entire conference, unlike sources like CNN that will zoom in and try to convince the masses that "stupid DRUMPF poured fish food becuZ he disrespectful! Fish food pouring is an impeachable offense". \n\nAnd man... You sure get this whole "first amendment right" thing mixed up. '
"I really don't have time to answer each one of those (I'm watching peaky blinders, it's really good btw).

'There is only word word to describe Trump and the people who love him.\n\n# DESPICABLE '
'Let he without sin cast the first stone.....funny that this guy thinks he is being all big useing religious comparisons, yet still cherrypicks just like any other democrat.'

They just scream louder for whoever the demigod leader is at the time to show them the way. It\'s a cult, plain and simple, they do not demand accountability or integrity from their demigod.'

'**Seven virtues**\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church defines virtue as "a habitual and firm disposition to do the good." Traditionally, the seven Christian virtues or heavenly virtues combine the four classical cardinal virtues of prudence, justice, temperance and courage (or fortitude) with the three theological virtues of faith, hope and charity. These were adopted by the Church Fathers as the seven virtues.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

'What do the indictments have to do with this? Well, they were brought by the same Special Prosecutor conducting the same investigation.  There’s that.'
'Guys like Bob Mueller don’t make indictments that they don’t have evidence to successfully prosecute on. One of my closest friends was a federal DA New York District. According to him, given the team he’s put together, they are deep into the money laundering pile. '
"I understand that mueller is acting from the perspective of justice and the remit of his special counsel but from a purely partisan political perspective I hope he doesn't act soon. Certainly with the history and breadth of trumps unscrupulous dealings his investigation could last another couple of years. In that time trump is as much of a threat to the republicans as anyone, he is a demonstrably atrocious negotiator and his record breaking inaction in terms of policy is fantastic for the democrats. Mike pence on the other hand  if he were to take office in a matter of months he could do untold damage to a womens right to choose, the separation of church and state, not to mention the usual plutocratic BS. From a personal perspective I hope Trump gets a 15+ year sentence (effectively life)."
'And the mill is grinding out some fine flour of justice from the grist of corruption.'
"he definitely would have the clout to pull a run, but Mueller seems like someone who much prefers being a soldier of the law than a politician that helps decide them. can't imagine him ever taking a job that forces himself to be consciously partisan in any way. "
'Absolutely fucking NOT.\n\nThat would call into question the impartiality of Justice.   You see an example of a political response with the do nothing Congress that ignores scandal and corruption at the highest level. \n\nMueller, and many others, serve our government outside of politics, and they are essential to making it work.  Honor their work... The patriotic diplomat, the just lawman, honorable civil servants, etc.... Politics need not apply.  \n\n'
"I hope not.  Trump is a prime example of someone who excels at one thing (self-promotion, whether in real estate, reality tv, or politics).  But even if he was very good in business (he isn't), being good at business doesn't mean you'll be good at politics.  This is what I say whenever someone suggests that a non-politician should run for office.  Zuckerberg?  Great businessman.  Complete mystery when it comes to politics.  Oprah? Great interviewer.  Politics?  I dunno.  John Stewart?  Hilarious comedian.  How will he perform on the job as president?  Christ, who really knows.\n\nMueller is an intelligent, focused, and morally upright person.  I am convinced that if he becomes President, he'll try his damnedest to be the best president we ever had.  But...does he have the specific skill set to be president?\n\nWe shouldn't go with celebrity presidents or presidents from outside the public sector, not if they don't prove themselves first with a governorship or senatorship.  Before his horrendous sexual assault allegations, I thought Al Franken was the most likely person to be successful as president who came from the public-sector limelight.  \n\nMueller is a great investigator.  Let's keep him where he's most useful.  "
'But he wouldn’t dare, his integrity is much too great to take advantage of his popularity in order to win a Presidential bid (not that he would want to). '
'He was never going to prosecute Trump.  His job is to gather all the evidence and present it.  Congress and the American people will take it from there.  That should be very clear to everyone by now.'
'You have to trust the justice system. I’m not a trump fan, never have and never will be probably. But I trust the institutions that we have and I trust those that hold those positions. If Mueller says trump did nothing wrong then we have to trust the evidence. '
'I’d vote for him in a heartbeat but I’m almost positive that he’s the dutiful hero that would turn down the presidency. Same sort of vibe as George Washington where people were interested in letting him be President for life but he turned it down as he had done the job he had set to do.\n\nIf no better candidate though, I’ll write the Chin of Justice in, no question.'
'I love that fucking story.'
" It's a theory.  A Scientific Theory. \n\nIt's a collection of facts that only leads to one natural conclusion.  \n\nAt this point there are billions of pieces of evidence, of facts, that all fit the model for Evolution being true.  If we unearthed a bone that didn't fit the model them we'd have to throw the theory out and start over.  That just hasn't happened yet. \n\nWith each new piece of evidence, the theory grows stronger, and that's all it has ever done since Darwin, actually his father, developed the theory roughly 150 years ago. \n\nIt predicted genes, for example, well before we had the mathematics to describe them, or even the microscopes to see them.  You can look up the date that Evolution was theorized and compare it to the date genes were discovered, it's all right there for anyone to see.  "

"For the sake of argument, let's leave legality aside for a minute. Instead, consider only the idea of money from Russia being given to the National Rifle Association, an American organization. What possible reason could anyone in Russia have to support the NRA? Do they want to promote gun ownership in America? I submit to you that what they wanted was to influence the US election, so they gave money to a US organization that carries heavy influence in US politics. Do you agree that that's probably why Russians would give money to an American gun-rights organization? If you agree, then please tell me, does that bother you? And if you disagree, then please tell me what other reason they would have to give money to the NRA."
'You know, for someone who claims to be an independent voter, you sure sound exactly like someone who usually posts on TD and who sides with the Republican party exclusively. '

"I use castbox. I've used podcast addict before but prefer castbox. \n\nIt's a great podcast that is specifically looking into the Trump organization, not so much the Mueller investigation. They did a great episode about the change in Trumps business practices. Trump was known as the king of debt and proudly proclaimed so. Suddenly for no reason, right around the time Eric Trump tweeted that the Trump Organization was flush with Russian cash they began buying up golf courses and property all across the globe. With cash. Which even if you have the cash you don't do. You only use a little bit of your money and use loans for everything else. But Trump suddenly started buying bad investments with cash. Unless you're cleaning dirty Russian money its really really strange. \n\nThey do a great investigative piece on this in one of their latest episode. "
"That's my read as well.  At a certain point, a well-deployed pardon scheme can basically subvert the rule of law.

You never get to actually talk to a representative anyways, you'll just say what your concerned about and the person on the phone will most likely throw your comment into a spreadsheet indicating what constituents have been calling about so they can see what's been the most important issue lately. Every call I've made has literally been over in no more than 30 seconds unless I really press an issue.\n\nIt may not feel like much by yourself but we need every voice.

This is literally saying I know what you did, but I’m going to let it slide.  '
"Are you kidding? Putin, the richest person in the world, sold trump the presidency. Now, Trump is doing his bidding, not enacting sanctions for a low fruit. I'm sorry, the US certainly does influence politics all over the globe. But Putin is out of control and needs to be stopped. Get the fuck out of my country Putin.   \nNow, the Russian people.. amazing people, love them. "
'Yeah I don’t disagree. It should though. I’m hoping we get enough seats that we can have a “reckonin” and if it turns out these guys actually did launder money for Russia or intentionally obstruct justice and I think they did, literally hundreds of them, then they need to be punished with the maximums for whatever they did. But fairly, and honestly and transparently. Not some coup type thing like the current guys are trying to pull off. This is how we restore our countries integrity. By showing the rule of law and the will of the majority wins in the end. If the trump treason stuff is true, he deserves the real penalty for it. But they’ll never go for that. That’s why obstruction is more realistic. '

'This is such sleazy messaging to scum like Cohen, Kushner, Donny Jr. , little Eric and all the other known, and as yet unknown, liars who carried the can for Trump.  All Trump toadies and criminals will be pardoned he collaterally declares. Everyday there is a new convulsion in the body politic. Democracy has to expel the bile and toxins to be well again. Scooter Libby is emblematic of the bile, and secondarily is consistent with Bolton getting his way to boot. Libby was the kind of neo-con slug that Bolton sees as a loyal soldier to his cause and instincts. Mueller and his team will not lose their nerve and despite the abuse of Executive power Trump and his kind will be humbled and brought to justice. Finding the pee-pee video, isn’t essential, or for that matter important, it’s just the metaphor to put the period at the end of the sentence: Here is the end of the Trump presidency. '
'But is Libby still important enough and connected to the GOP establishment where they would owe him a favor. If Trump wanted support in the firing of Mueller or Rosenstein, I imagine the GOP would exact something far more valuable to them than the pardoning of a disgraced aide no one has really thought about for years. '
'This article made some good suggestions as to why, I believe.\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2018/04/13/politics/trump-scooter-libby-pardon/index.html\n\nPersonally, I think railing against the decisions of a special council in general (and *specifically* one appointed by Comey) makes the most sense, as does the connection between diGenova and Toensing with Libby, who have apparently still been talking with Trump despite declining to represent him.\n\nTake "revenge" on an enemy while doing a favor for a couple supporters? Seems to check out.'
"Great point - hadn't thought of that."
'Its such a terrible way to approach politics. To treat it like a team sport to which you choose a team and owe that team unwavering support regardless of that team constantly doing things that go directly against your self interest.

This blind faith and cult like support is pathetic and has much more to do with a personality cult and a sad need to feel like you "win" something than it does political policy that they agree with.'

'just what i’ve gathered from following this saga, but i looked it up\n\n>[In the United States, the pardon power for federal crimes is granted to the President of the United States under Article II, Section 2 of the United States Constitution which states that the President "shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment". The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted this language to include the power to grant pardons, conditional pardons, commutations of sentence, conditional commutations of sentence, remissions of fines and forfeitures, respites, and amnesties. The pardon can also be used for a presumptive case, such as when President Gerald Ford pardoned Nixon over any possible crimes regarding the Watergate scandal. There is a strong consensus among legal experts that a president cannot pardon someone for state crimes. Experts disagree as to whether a president can pardon himself.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_pardons_in_the_United_States) '

'When the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu visited London in 1978, the British government did some serious sucking up. Ceausescu was an egomaniac and possibly crazy. When he went hunting outside Bucharest, his body-guards shot game with machine guns so he could be photographed at the end of the day with a shoulder-high pile of dead animals. He was also said to be a germophobe, sterilising his hand with pure alcohol if it touched a door handle. The French president telephoned the Queen to warn her that when the Ceausescus came to the Élysée, lamps, vases, ashtrays and bathroom taps went missing from their rooms. But Ceausescu got a state visit to Britain, with a knighthood (later revoked) and a stay in Buckingham Palace.\n\nWestern governments are now trying to appease another germophobe with a reputation for narcissistic excess. The US is not Romania, the stories about Donald J. Trump focus on his cheating at golf, not hunting, and if the great developer removes any bathroom taps, it will be to replace them with something gold-plated. Even so, America’s allies worry that President Trump will get out of bed one morning and do something crazy: abolish Nato, declare war on Canada, give Alaska back to the Russians.\n\nSo how might Britain be sucking up to Trump? A Labour MP, Ben Bradshaw, thinks that the government has not always done all it can to assist the Mueller inquiry into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia. Bradshaw was the minister in charge of the Secret Intelligence Service, known as MI6, and has doggedly pursued allegations about Russian meddling in other people’s elections. ‘I’m told that Mueller’s team were over here late last year and they weren’t happy with the level of cooperation they were getting,’ he said. Another source, with links to the ‘intelligence community’, said this was continuing, even after the Skripal poisoning.\n\nThese claims — of a decision to go slow with Mueller, driven by expediency — have not been confirmed, but if true, the government may have miscalculated. Britain is trying to get a free-trade deal with the US as we leave the EU. And Theresa May was the first world leader through the door of the Oval Office to see the new president. But whatever promises she wrung from Trump will depend on a follow–through and focus he has not shown. This is a president who could not get his own healthcare bill past a Republican Congress.\n\n‘Seen from the inside, the chaos is a hundred times worse than you can imagine,’ said one former senior White House official. There seems even less chance of a special deal for Britain after this month’s disastrous G7 meeting. ‘We’re like the piggy bank that everybody’s robbing,’ the President said. Britain will have to pay a 25 per cent steel tariff just like the rest of the EU and Canada. There was a testy phone call about this with Justin Trudeau, the Canadian Prime Minster. ‘Didn’t you guys burn down the White House?’ Trump is supposed to have said. The President had better not learn this was the British Redcoats or he might begin to suspect a pattern. This is because of the extraordinary number of British connections to what Trump has described as a conspiracy to destroy his presidency: the Russia investigation.\n\nThe most important ‘British connection’ is, of course, Christopher Steele, the former MI6 officer whose ‘dossier’ is the road map for the US inquiry. After he wrote it, Steele asked the retired head of MI6 Sir Richard Dearlove what he should do and was advised that the US authorities had to be told. Dearlove’s partner in a forum for intelligence professionals at Cambridge University was Professor Stefan Halper, apparently a long-standing CIA ‘asset’. Halper was used by the FBI to get close to George Papadopoulos, an aide on the Trump campaign. Papadopoulos was drinking in a Kensington wine bar with the Australian High Commissioner and told him that Russia had supplied ‘dirt’ on Hillary Clinton. Hearing about the conversation, the then director of the FBI, James Comey, began a counter-intelligence investigation with the CIA.\n\nThat is the cover story, anyway: a US intelligence official told me there were ‘many gathering clouds’ in the summer of 2016. Among them might be GCHQ’s intercepts of Trump’s associates talking to Russians. Some — credible — [reports](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/13/british-spies-first-to-spot-trump-team-links-russia) say the head of GCHQ flew to the US to hand-deliver this incendiary material to the CIA director. Later, Steele’s dossier was passed, in its entirety, to Comey, thanks to a former British ambassador to Moscow, Sir Andrew Wood.\n\nThen there’s Cambridge Analytica. The (now shuttered) British company did the Trump campaign’s data. Its speciality was ‘microtargeting’: individual messages tailored to individual voters, delivered by email, Facebook and Twitter. The US intelligence agencies believe that Russian internet ‘troll factories’ were also pushing out pro-Trump propaganda on social media: sometimes fake news, sometimes real news, such as the hacked contents of Clinton’s emails. The question is whether this was done in coordination with the Trump campaign. An American lawyer I know told me that he was approached by a Cambridge Analytica employee after the election. They had had the Clinton campaign emails more than a month before they were published by WikiLeaks: ‘What should I do?’ Take this to Mueller, the lawyer replied.\n\nThere is another (alleged) British connection: the US media reports that former Ukip leader Nigel Farage is a ‘person of interest’ to the Mueller team because he is both friendly with Trump and visited the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange. Farage has vehemently denied he was helping Assange communicate with Trump’s people and has insisted he has ‘no connections to Russia’.\n\nAfter President Trump’s shock election victory, I’m told that Steele briefed his old colleagues in the British intelligence apparatus. His material was taken seriously and then handled at an ‘appropriately senior level’ within the government. But once the dossier was leaked and published in January 2017, he appeared to have been sidelined by the government, his friends say, ‘for political reasons’.\n\nThose who know him say that he still appears bruised by his treatment. Nevertheless, when he subsequently spoke to Mueller’s team, the meeting — in the UK — was set up ‘through official channels’. Mueller has so many British leads to follow, there must have been many requests to the authorities here. Ministers, including the Prime Minster, have been coy about how much help he is getting. Perhaps it is a case of appearing to go slow with Mueller, rather than actually failing to cooperate.\n\nMinisters have also been careful to say that so far there is no evidence of Russian interference in British politics. Steele and others believe evidence of this will emerge. The self-styled ‘bad boy of Brexit’ Arron Banks is being investigated by the Electoral Commission, which wants to know the source of £2.3 million given to Leave.EU, along with at least £6 million in loans to the organisation on ‘non-commercial terms’. This was the biggest single political donation in British history. Banks has a successful insurance business but his opaque finances have led some to ask whether the ultimate source of the Leave.EU money could be Russia. The *Sunday Times* asked him why he’d met the Russian ambassador three times during the referendum campaign. His response was that they were looking for a conspiracy in ‘two boozy lunches and a cup of tea’: ‘Bite me.’ He was similarly dismissive of MPs last week, when they asked if he had ties to the Kremlin.\n\nThe ‘Western intelligence community’ — a nebulous group encompassing Steele, his associates, the US intelligence agencies and many experts in Britain — believe the Kremlin is directing operations to try to shake public faith in democracy across Europe and the US. They think Russia has the same aim as the Soviet Union once did: to break up Nato and the EU, and dominate a continent of weak nations. They view Russia as a criminal state, where the state and the mafia are two faces of the same predatory beast. If that is right, then for the government the choice over whether to back Mueller — and the rule of law — should be no choice at all.'

'How can we tell what the support actually is, if like you say, dissent is crushed promptly? That certainly has a chilling effect on the true numbers of satisfaction with their government. I prefer to err on the side of good intent until proven otherwise. \n\nWith that said, people do tend to be motivated by perceived national embarrassment, and support politicians who call it out and who promise reprisal. Mao sought to rectify Chinese historical embarrassments, as did the nazis, and most recently Trumpism. So the point that Russians distain Americans is valid, but I’m more inclined to think the support for America in Russia is undersold for various motives.'

"Oh, I don't know. When faced with the prospect of federal prison, it's amazing how brave some people aren't. I expect Bannon to be suddenly struck by the value of humility and honesty."
'Well, he’s definitely not a moron. He might have some oddball or unpleasant beliefs, but he was smart enough to be a VP at Goldman. That puts him well above average in terms of intelligence.'
"I think it's pretty obvious he was playing along with the Russians. Breitbart was practically fed RT headlines."
"Yeah it's definitely possible. It's such a strange situation... I guess my belief is that there is a contingent of libertarian extremists that wouldn't NEED Russian influence to act the way he does (no genius required). Whether he belongs to that camp or not, I don't know. The actions could easily be explained by him bring a Putin puppet as well."
"I said neolibertarian, not neoliberal. I don't know if I made up neolibertarianism, but I think of it as a form of extremist libertarian where 'freedom from government' is strongly influenced by neonazism and isolationism"
'Bannon is many things, but a libertarian he is not. First and foremost, he’s an authoritarian nationalist and/or fascist. Bannon has proposed regulating Facebook and Google like utilities and favors economic protectionism over free trade. Establishing a 100 percent free market doesn’t seem to be one of his biggest priorities. Unlike most prominent Republicans, I don’t think Bannon cares much about enriching GOP Donors or multinational corporations. Bannon isn’t pandering to uneducated racists so he can pass tax cuts for the wealthy –I think Bannon genuinely wants to set up an authoritarian white-ethnostate. \n\nIn a lot of ways that makes him the inverse of most congressional Republicans and it’s also what makes him so fucking terrifying.

'Seriously, take a step back and think about this.  While Trump was cruising along in the GOP primaries, his staff was small and dysfunctional.  When it became clear he would win the nomination, he got a little help from the RNC, but not much.  No one, including his own campaign thought he would win.  And judging by the level of competence Trump’s White House has displayed since the election (virtually none whatsoever) I find it incredibly hard to believe that Trump himself could have been involved in any scheme to collude with the Russians vis a vis the elections.  Sure the Russians interfered, but they probably realized that if they wanted the job done right, do it yourselves.  IMO Mueller has the “headshot” for obstruction, and hopefully he has Trump & Co dead to rights on money laundering, as well as a half dozen other crimes.  Not that the GOP will do anything with it, but there it is.  \n&nbsp;  \nTrump is too stupid to collude with Russia interferring with the election.  But Mueller probably has him on obstruction of justice and other crimes.'

"So popular, yes. That's why he can't go to the UK for a visit, because of his popularity…"
'Oh okay who won the presidency again'
'I 100% believe he was too stupid to organize it himself.\n\nI also 100% believe he was too stupid to hear someone say "We\'ll help you win the election" and not stop and think, "If Russia helps me win the election I\'ve just committed an act of sedition."  Largely because "sedition" is too big a word for him.\n\nThankfully, our justice system does not accept rampant stupidity and ignorance as a defense. '
"This is pretty much how I see Trump.  Russian intelligence has been all over the guy for 30 years and he's never figured it out."
"I would look at it this way, sowing chaos is pretty much just as useful to putins goals. Russia is not going to be the next world super power, but it can at least try to play kingmaker,  weaken the U. S. standing, hopefully setting up the proper alliances for economic success and global relevance in the future. Trump's incompetence (thank goodness) of playing with political weapons he isn't proficient at, doesn't mean that he wouldn't be dumb enough to try. It also doesn't mean Putin wouldn't seize the opportunity. \n\nIf trump had lost, how many of these guys would be punished? Probably less or none. What kind of connections could Russia have made, especially if people in the know were told what they had accomplished? What future havoc could they wreak with more active support in the u.s. in 2020 or 2024 with a more competent plan and candidate. \n\nI agree that nobody expected trump to win, but i think Putin was playing the longer game and america is just a little too stupid.  It worked out like this instead. Trump is still guilty though. "
'LOL nice and spicy. I like how people always say "you\'re still on hillary" as if the corruption ring she is apart of is not an issue we have to contend with any more. For Fucks sake we have evidence that our government used made up documents that were paid for by the DNC to then gain access and spy on Trump\'s campaign. These are the people we need to be looking at, not some nonsense about how trump\'s kid might have talked to someone that claimed to have information on Hillary\'s corruption. '
'So you\'re saying that we should wait for Mueller to finish his investigation?\n\nGood.  Tell the rest of the Trump supporters.  They don\'t seem to agree with you, or they wouldn\'t be pushing to have Mueller fired/imprisoned/hung for being part of an alleged "deep state" conspiracy.\n'
'Ah, the old "ye of little faith" bit. As long as you believe it to be true, it\'s true. Right? '
'To me, the much more damning line was his initial response when Comey told him there was intelligence that he was recorded with prostitutes peeing on the bed.  His response to that was:\n\n"There were no prostitutes; there were never prostitutes"\n\nTo me, that sure sounds like a non-denial of most of the important points of the story, and a focus on if the women doing the peeing in the video were technically prostitutes.  e.g. if Trump wasn\'t the one paying them, he can claim they weren\'t prostitutes.\n'
'The obvious lie is right here. "People reminded me". \n\nThink about it. That takes him out of the equation. Someone ELSE told the lie and he hopes it\'s true so Trump believes it and repeats it.'

It feels slow right now because the majority of elected leaders in the Senate and House have a vested interest in keeping Trump's skeletons in the closet. \n\nAlso, everything we are hearing about Mueller's work is months old, as he is surely keeping his cards close to the chest to prevent outside tampering with the investigation. Rest assured, more will continue to come out."
"Well, Russia went broke for a while, so trying to outspend us militarily wasn't an option.  They had to get creative and work on a budget.  I think the USA kind of relaxed a bit too much and just assumed that were untouchable.  Russia took advantage of our hubris."

'I know this is old news, but that\'s kind of the point. I see debates with Trump supporters constantly where they claim there\'s no evidence of collusion yet, and nobody calls them out on it. Here\'s my go-to response:\n\n>[There\'s already evidence of collusion](https://www.justice.gov/file/1007346/download).\n\n>>On or about May 21, 2016, defendant PAPADOPOULOS emailed another high-ranking Campaign official, with the subject line "Request from Russia to meet Mr. Trump." The email included the May 4 MFA Email and added: "Russia has been eager to meet Mr. Trump for quite sometime and have been reaching out to me to discuss."^2\n\n>>On or about June 1, 2016, defendant PAPADOPOULOS emailed the High-Ranking Campaign Official and asked about Russia. The High-Ranking Campaign Official referred him to the Campaign Supervisor because "[h]e is running point." Defendant PAPADOPOULOS then emailed the Campaign Supervisor, with the subject line "Re: Messages from Russia": "I have the Russian MF A asking me if Mr. Trump is interested in visiting Russia at some point. Wanted to pass this info along to you for you to decide what\'s best to do with it and what message I should send (or to ignore)."\n\n...\n\n>>After several weeks of further communications regarding a potential "off the record" meeting with Russian officials, on or about August 15, 2016, the Campaign Supervisor told defendant PAPADOPOULOS that "I would encourage you" and another foreign policy advisor to the Campaign to "make the trip[], if it is feasible."\n\n>>^2: The government notes that the official forwarded defendant PAPADOPOULOS\'s email to another Campaign official (without including defendant PAPADOPOULOS) and stated: "Let[\']s discuss. We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips. It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal."\n\n\n>Please note that these are not mere allegations. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to the charge of lying to the FBI, and stipulated to the truth of those facts. \n\nThey rarely have a response to this comment. Unfortunately, I\'m perma-banned from r politics for saying Donald Rumsfeld should go crawl back in whatever hole he came out of and die, so I\'m not able to provide this response on there. It seems like not nearly enough people realize this when talking about the Mueller investigation.'
"I'd put this on /r/Russialago as well as any other subreddits dedicated to this investigation"
'Come join us at r/Russialago if politics wont have you... this is a great comment, and many will pick this up and help you.'
'Im geneuinely trying to understand this better so please dont attack me. But I dont understand how this is evidence that Trump colluded. It sounds like they say Trump specifically wasnt involved in this. I mean it depends the context of "send a signal". Seems like how you interpret thats the only evidence, and obv that can be interpretted many ways. Do we know if they even sent someone tho? Or that Trump knew they were. And this was like 3 months before Trump won. I thought the claims were Trump had been colluding with Trump since early on? And if he had why would they even be having this discussion. Seems like proof that Trump at least wasnt colluding until the very end of the election.'
"The reply is easy:  there is no evidence of collusion in that passage.  Nothing whatsoever.  It is not uncommon for presidential nominees to have contact with foreign government leaders, or meet with foreign officials.  Try to act like it is, but is not uncommon.  \n\nIs anyone crying collusion about how Trump met personally with Enrique Nieto or Bibi Netenyahu?  Clinton had meetings with Shinzo Abe and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in October a month before the election.  There is nothing illegal about that.\n\nThe only thing evident in that passage is that for whatever reason, the campaign didn't want Trump doing the meeting in person.  You can read into it whatever you want.  You can say they were discussing new resort locations for Elvis Presley and Jimmy Hoffa to live at.  There is nothing illegal about meeting foreign representatives, and this passage doesn't even prove they did meet with anyone, only they were talking about it."
'> Is there any proof that Trump himself asked the Russians for help \n\nYes. He did it on national television. He also confessed to obstruction of justice on national television.'
'Good call, thanks'
'I\'ll clarify this for you because this point is often missed. You\'re right, speaking with foreign entities isn\'t the issue. The issue is negotiating policy with them prior to actually becoming the president. Mueller\'s angle here is that Trump\'s team was actively negotiating a sanctions reduction or removal with Russia before the election, likely in exchange for business advantages with various members of Trump\'s team and possibly his family. This is collusion because it sparked Russia to actively interfere with the election, and right now there are many signs that this was the case. One of the biggest being the Russians signaling that they were sitting on top of Hillary\'s hacked email archive and that Don Jr was more than happy to receive this "gift". '
"Yeah, a huge waste of money.\n\nWhere as scumbags like Scott Pruitt who are flying constantly on first class and Trump's weekly golf trips are wonderful uses of taxpayer money. "
">Mueller needs something that republicans can't deny or attempt to discredit\n\nSo, testimony by God, in person, with video recordings to corroborate his testimony, all conveniently on a day when FOX temporarily stops broadcasting, and Congress oversleeps.\n\nBut even then, it didn't happen.  And if it did, it wasn't collusion.  And if it was, Donny didn't know.  And if he did, it wasn't that bad.  And if it was, we deserved it."
'Almost every politician opperates in the grey areas of the law, which isnt illegal. That is old news and simply wasnt illegal because the women technically wasnt an offical anyways. This just isnt anything significant enough to be termed as evidence towards actual collusion. The goal posts are moving. Do u agree that this at least evidence that they had not been colluding with Russia up until this point? I mean why would they be going to this meeting if they were already in contact?'
'moving goalposts? Nice analogy. No score though. Looks like Papa D was a bench warmer or towel boy.'

If we can\'t even trust someone like that to do his job, how can we trust anyone in public office? Remember, the investigation was started to find evidence of Russian tampering in the US election. So far, **five people have plead guilty, and 17 more have been indicted.** As far as official political investigations go, this has been one of the most successful in modern history. Whatever your stance on Trump, if he hasn\'t done anything wrong then he\'s got nothing to worry about.

"Obama extended Mueller's statutory term as head of the FBI for two years from 10 to 12 because it just so happened that there were several other high-profile departures within DHS around the same time (head of the CIA was one), and they didn't want to upend the whole department's supply of institutional knowledge all at once.  He did this with the consent of a Republican Congress.  Two years later, he appointed James Comey to replace him, again, with Republican Senate approval. Throughout his term, Meuller had extremely high levels of bi-partisan respect for his integrity and skill in the job, hence the extension. Then Bengazi, butter emails and Russiagate happened, which politicized the whole department's interaction with the political establishment in Washington. And, because for the Republicans, winning elections is more important than *anything else* they decided to politicize an agency which had been supremely apolitical since the death of J. Edgar Hoover.  Feel free to drop that on your father, because that's what actually happened."

"Sounds like it's time for some good old no-contact."
'Many, many other presidential campaigns, including Obama\'s, have been approached by foreign nationals offering "help" of one sort or another.

"I see your reasoning but none of it is actually valid.  The Greens are what, the second largest political party in the world being the CP?  They aren't just spoilers, they represent the interests of the biosphere beyond petty human concerns, and the human rights of humans beyond economic concerns, and the advancement of science.  \n\nShe went to Russia because she was hoping for help achieving these goals, however corrupt the motives of the Russians might have been (and they were, the Russians in power are the bastard children of Reagan and Murdoch's neoliberalism).  \n\nThe Greens are in fact far to the left of the Russian or for that matter any remaining communist party in that they hold to an uncompromising and unsympathetic analysis of the history of capitalism.  Read the work of David Cobb if you don't believe me.\n\nAs for where the Greens campaign -- they're a political party and have every right to campaign where they choose. You have to disabuse yourself of the idea the dems are somehow the good guys in all this and that somehow the Greens tacitly see them that way. Even the FDR dems were a bulwark *against* true progressive change, and the neoliberal dems of the Clinton generation are far to the right of anything the Greens could possibly support -- and the Russians are even further right.  The Greens don't play to win in the US except in a few enclaves, rather, they try to win percentages of totals that get them certain advantages in the corrupt profoundly anti-democratic two party system in which they are forced to operate.  \n\nI assure you, Clinton did a fine job of weakening herself. If she hadn't used that private server in the first place, none of this would have happened.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I want to see Trump et al drawn and quartered as much as the next guy, not least because I'm a true progressive -- but it doesn't therefore follow I have to have respect for what the dems have become.  And I'm not an outlier -- a huge percentage of the voting/non-voting public feel as I do -- that our modern views simply aren't represented by either corporate party, and that both in fact are profoundly the enemies of the survival of higher life on the planet."
'This might help your understanding: The dems/GOP are like American Football, popular only in the United States and considered kind of brutal and stupid everywhere else. Whereas the Greens are like FIFA football, popular the world over and a whole lot better and more beautiful.\n'

If in fact there is a blur change in Congress in 2018, that is the only time it will stick, which is a year from now when that group comes in.

"It's like an advent calendar of freshly delivered justice"
'Please let this be true'
'Lmao. \n\nMueller was appointed as a Special Counsel by Rod Rosenstein in May 2017 pursuant to Rosenstein’s authority as Acting Attorney General.  In the appointment order, Rosenstein states that Mueller is subject to the regulations governing special counsels.  One of those regulations, 28 CFR §600.7 (a), specifies that the special counsel must “comply with the rules, regulations, procedures, practices and policies of the Department of Justice.”\n\nTherefore, Mueller must comply with the policies of the Justice Department – and the policy of the department according to the opinions issued in 1973 and 2000 is that a sitting president cannot be criminally indicted or prosecuted. \n\nThe bottom line is that no matter what evidence Mueller turns up, he can’t indict the president if he follows DOJ policy unless that policy is changed by the Deputy Attorney General or the Attorney General.   According to the Justice Department, the only way a president can be removed from office is through impeachment, and that process has never once ousted a president.'
'I would say that "I wonder if Donald could have his own son killed," but I am sure he would and could to save his own ass.\n\nI wonder, rather, if Mueller has a protection plan in place for him if needed?'
"They won't flip, they are convinced that they own the system. They've been running the country for over a year they have a good reason to feel invincible."
' Believe he said shoot someone on 5th Ave and not lose any supporter and/or voters.  Something like that. It was pre-election. I guess I could google it but too lazy.  Anyway he’s right that his supporters are loyal, and as long as he has them Repubs in Congress won’t turn on him.  So we REALLY need Dems to take back house/Senate in 2018.  '
'Mueller knows the 13 Russians are never likely to set foot in a U.S. courtroom. Seems the primary goal of indicting them (beyond the pursuit of justice for its own sake) was for the DOJ to make the case beyond a reasonable doubt that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, thereby laying to rest some angst from some in the right that the probe is a waste of time. It was important for them to do so through the proper scope of the court and not through some semi-informal method like an unclassified memo that would be endlessly debated. The fact that a grand jury indicted these Russians means the charge is backed up by substantial proof. '

"Ryan doesn't have the guts to rein them in. The party of patriotism, common sense budgets and family values - now the party of Putin, blow up the deficit and grab pussies like they're going extinct."
"The memo is not falsified in the slightest. However, it's hardly the damning indictment of the deep state the Republicans on the House Intelligence Comittee were making it out to be -- in fact, it shows Rosenstein doing his job, taking out a survelliance warrant on a man suspected of betraying the United States to Russia. \n\nWe can argue about whether FISA was a good idea in the first place, but it's undeniable Rosenstein acted legally and in the best interests of the American people."
"I bet gold with a guy a week or two ago that Trump would snot rocket onto a foreign diplomat within the month. WEF was my lucky horse but nuthin' yet.\n\nBut yea, I'd like to see the odds of things like that Trump uses this memo to fire/re-assign Rosenstein or that Jared Kushner is the next one indicted. "

"Trump managed to win the primary against stiff resistance with Manaforts help. Doesn't make Manafort A good guy.

After the nomination Trump fired Manafort. This idea that they were colluding with Russia together has no basis in fact. It exsists in your head because you don't know jackshit"

If you are actually as smart as you see yourself, why did you just throw three different logical fallacies at me in place of an actual argument? \n\nManafort's crimes occured while he was involved with Obama's administration. Years before the three month period he worked for Trump. Still haven't seen anyone explain why this is going to bring down Trump. I think its wishful thinking on your part that comes from ignorance of who Manafort is and what he is actually being charged with.

"Everything I've read from lawyers on twitter (@tribe etc) say there is precedent that accepting a pardon is an admission of guilt, as such it could be used as such in state cases which are not pardonable by the president.\n\nTrump's pardon of Sherif Joe has resulted in civil liability exposure and a rather abrupt realization that it is now impossible for him to be exonerated through the judicial process.  Joe isn't going to jail but he may die broke.\n\n@tribe and others also argue that a case can be made that a pardon can not be issued where there is a conflict of interest (self pardon or pardoning conspirators).  But testing that is a ways off.\n\nRegardless, pardons are more of a monkey's paw instead of a panacea especially in the hands of someone like trump."

'I used to be a Republican. Then one day, I realized that today\'s Democrats *actually* represent the things the Republicans claimed to. Fiscal responsibility, personal liberty, and thoughtful policy over emotional appeals were once the Hallmark of Republicans. Now, they only care about "cut and spend" politics and pushing Christian values as law. Fuck all that '
'I made the conversion back in 2008 when Obama was running, although I had considered George Bush to be an idiot for long before then. I was really only drank the kool-aid when I was younger (back in the 90s). \n\nBut one day I realized that the things I valued were not represented in the actions of the GOP.\n\n1.fiscal responsibility: the democrats may be "tax and spend", but the GOP is cut and spend. I don\'t like tax and spend, but it is technically feasible> The GOP spends just as much, but they cut taxes and then borrow the money. That is not fiscal conservatism. True responsibility means spending money wisely, including spending more in some places to save money elsewhere. Furthermore, I looked at deficits during presidencies in my life. The debt skyrocketed under Regan and Bush Sr. Clinton took that and handed off a **balanced budget** to Dubya, who promptly drove the economy into the ground. Obama then spent 8 years recovering us from that disaster. So really, who is actually making smart fiscal decisions?\n1.personal liberty: I don\'t want the government telling us how to live our lives, and I apply this equally to everybody. If you are gay, the government shouldn\'t limit your options, including your ability to marry. I\'m sure I do shit people don\'t like, and I don\'t want to change. So that means I can\'t ask you to change if I don\'t like what you do. If you want an abortion, just let them. If you don\'t like it, don\'t get one. The GOP went from the personal liberty party to the christian conservative party who wanted to legislate their religion\n\nAs for how you find and convince people like me, I have no idea. I think the big thing is that I\'m agnostic, so I actively dislike the christian bent of the GOP. I don\'t know how many non-religions republicans are out there (probably not many at this point). The other big thing is to get people out of the environment that reinforces their views. I was feeling cognitive dissonance for a while, but until I moved away from my father, I wasn\'t able to face the fact that my politics directly contradicted my beliefs (even then, it took years). \n\nBut also, I\'m an add duck. The reason I support Bernie Sanders is because if the Democrats go back to being liberal again, the GOP can go back to being respectable conservatives again. And then, the political center will go back to the actual center.'
'Simply amazing how the republican base fawn over this failure.\n\nWent bankrupt so many times, he had to resort to Russian sourced loans. Then he sells vastly overpriced property to Russian Billionaires. Then you need to decide are all these billionaires (all of them...) so stupid they love to pay outrageous markups or was there something else going on.\n\nNow he publically dances to every Putin tune. And they still love him. But yet they think they are true blooded americans. Fucking sellouts.'
'I think you’re thinking of Boris Yeltsin. \n\nNo offense to anyone but I keep seeing that it feels like this or it seems like that. This is going to end up in the dictionary as an example under the words blatant and/or obvious, you ask me. \n\nYes Trump is aiding the Russians. Yes, he is under investigation for possibly receiving aid from the Russians to get elected. This is quid pro quo, but there is nothing to do unless the house and senate grow a pair and impeach him immediately. '
'Perfect divide and conquer technique.  Well done putin '
"How does demanding that NATO spend more money on defense, as they agreed to, by treaty, help Russia?  How does ending bad trade deals for the US benefit Russia?  How does a roaring economy, repatriating money from overseas, and low unemployment here in the US help Russia?  How does reducing regulation and taxes here, and thereby helping the US become not just energy independent, but a net exporter of energy help Russia?  How does America shipping LNG to Europe so they won't have to depend on Russian natural gas not to freeze in the Winter help Russia?  \n\nThe short question is, how does a stronger America and a stronger NATO help Russia?  This is where your narrative falls apart.  \n\nEdit:  How does getting N. Korea to get rid of nukes and make peace with S. Korea help Russia?  "
"I think you're right.  I was reading the other day about the Western political spectrum being reorganized from a left-right model to an [open-closed model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_political_spectrum).  It made *a lot* of sense to me.  I think in 20-30 years this transition will be complete.  What that means for the current left-right parties? Hard to say, especially in the US, but some fracturing might take place, especially on the right.  I could see the Democrats transitioning from center/center-left to open, but it's harder to see the GOP transitioning fully to a closed model.  Many of the large backers of the GOP need globalization in order to maintain their positions.  I think it's more likely that the GOP will split into a closed party and an open party which is more conservative on social issues."

"These summits aren't a 'cool kids club'.  The purpose of the group is economic, to advance the common interests of the largest developed global economies.  At some point, Russia should be invited back, as a developed global economic state.  That point comes when Russia decides to not invade sovereign states, and instead play nice with other nations to benefit its own economic interests.  Until then, agreed, fuck those guys.\n\nEdit.  To address whether or not the US should or shouldn't be removed as per Macron's proposal.  Honestly guys, it doesn't really matter.  With Trump as the head of state and his nitwits running the show, America's national interests aren’t getting advanced at this thing.  I honestly believe that their 'plan' is to show up and make a couple of 5 second video clips that play well on Fox, and then wing the rest of the damn thing.

Still a powerful message though. \n\nEdit: just noticed I’m being severely downvoted for pointing out that jail and prison are different.

Yet another baseless claim from a brainwashed Russian T_D shill.\n\nSo, if you have all these resources at your finger tips from google why choose such a disreputable outlet? \n\nProbably because you have no idea how to think critically, which is why you support such a vindictive top shelf POS.\n\nDrink the Russian cool aid big guy, you're as un-American as they come."

'I’m starting to think that Mueller will only do what’s good for the Republican Party.. people are saying that he is avoiding any bombshells before the November election..\n\nWhy does he care about helping republicans in the November election.. why doesn’t Mueller care about America instead?\n\nOh I know why.. because he is a republican!!'
"So. I'm gonna post this on the off chance that I'm missing some meme, and that you're not actually this stupid.\n\nIgnoring that you think leaks about an ongoing criminal investigation would HELP republicans, about whom the investigation is centered...\n\nIf he thinks the Republican party is complicit, why would he release info at a time when the Republican party is in control of all 3 branches of the government? The only people who can take down the sitting US President is Congress. If they are controlled by the people propping him up, why would they take him down while they're reaping the benefits??"

'My interest in seeing Trump removed from office is related to what you have mentioned. His whole platform was and is a farce. What definition of great is he working from to want to make the U.S great again? When people die from basic health care needs because they cannot afford it, or whether teachers need to work second jobs to earn enough money to live, suggests that something is wrong with a system that Trump is in charge of. The American people are being shit on by the own president and government, and as a caring human being, I have an interest in seeing Trump removed from office for the good of the American people.'

'I wonder. Would secret service protect him in jail like how they protect all former Presidents? I sniff a Tru TV show'
"Honestly, I think that's too hopeful. Chances are nothing will happen to him. He's escaped every possible thing that can destroy ANY person's career. Without even apologizing once! The Blue Wave will probably diminish given he has a strong economy and job growth (thanks Obama?), even if that's not necessarily from his own actions. As much as I want to see him out of office, at the end of the day the Blue Wave is running on a hypothetical message while he has real economic numbers and whatnot to back him. "

"I would not turn on him at all. I believe Mueller is the best person for the job and I'll be satisfied with his investigation's conclusions. If he says Trump is innocent of all crimes, it's almost certainly true. But it isn't looking like that's going to be the case.

The only way he is stumped is by himself and we see that time and time again with his absurd tweets etc.  It is likely that he incriminated himself by way of his own words.\n\nIn regards to him leaving the Oval Office the guy would never go down without a fight. To your point of him leaving office, I think his excuse would be that he just cant work with the government, inept etc. etc. I am going back to my family job where I can work with people who can work with me.\n\nTrump may be rich and powerful but he screwed lots of people over in his day as NYC loud mouth.  Endless litigation, burning well to do people etc. The guy is an asshole and yea he found a way out of everything HOWEVER he is now under scrutiny the likes of which he has never known.  Who then would come to help the loud mouth, B-list celebrity who was never such a hot shot and is finally getting his?  \n\nJust some scattered thoughts..."

They are in the process of collecting fucktons of evidence and making sure they are doing it by the book. \n\nThey can’t give you a daily TLDR because going public too early could jeopardize the case when say person A is caught with ties to person B they don’t want person B to know they know yet, and person C connected to B would have the opportunity to cover their tracks.'

'Trump is taking the right approach. Unless you actually want to start arresting  Russian intelligence officers or overthrowing Putin, all one could do as a "normal" politician is huff and puff and stomp your feet. \n\nMeddling in elections is a time-honored tradition among superpowers (or former superpowers). The United States holds the record for most elections meddled in at 81. Russia (or the former Soviet Union) is second at 36. In 1964 both the Soviets and the United States meddled in the Chilean election. The CIA spent $2.4 million in secret to make sure the socialist did not win. With no surprise the Christian Democrat won. \n\nI felt that Facebook ads and hacked servers that should have been more secure would be a footnote in history. Instead, it\'s being used against a man who campaigned on and never made secret his desire to normalize relations with Russia to tackle bigger issues. He knows how other presidents have approached Russia and it has gotten us nowhere. He has seen how Europe is being slowly invaded and is buckling under its various welfare states and damn near Orwelian speech laws and won\'t be much stronger in the future. No loss there.\n\nIt really baffles me how anyone could be against Russia and America even just talking. Even if nothing happens, that\'s about as much as we could expect from any other administration when it comes to Russia and North Korea. \n\nI just have no strong feelings on it. I\'m cynical about all of it.  That\'s enough to get you exiled these days. \n\nI think a lot of it is jealousy from the establishment and their sympathisers. They should have been the ones dealing with the Russia problem, and all the other problems in the world, not the worse candidate in history who beat the best candidate in history. '

'**#TRE45ON**\n\nBelow I will summarize primary sources from the Justice Department, Senate Intelligence Committee, and the Department of Homeland Security. I will quote directly from primary sources. Today President Trump once again undermined American democracy and its institutions, instead he defended Putin\'s egregious attacks in front of the entire world.\n\n**July 3, 2018 the Senate Intelligence Committee, led by Republican Senator Richard Burr, concluded that Russia interfered with the American election and specifically helped Donald J. Trump.^[[1]](https://www.burr.senate.gov/download/final-ssci-ica-assessment)**\n\n*Pg. 4*\n\n>We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in  2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia\'s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\n\n**July 13, 2018 Special Counsel Mueller\'s indictment of 12 Russian Intelligence Officers.**\n\nLast week the Justice Department indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers linked to Guccifer 2.0 and their role in hacking Clinton and the DNC.^[[2]](https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download) The Russians had access to information on 500,000 voters, officially vote tallies were not changed however they targeted voter registration rolls.^[[3]](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/13/5-key-takeaways-from-mueller-indictment-of-russian-election-hackers.html)\n\n>The Russians allegedly hacked America\'s election infrastructure, including state election boards and secretaries of state. The allegations in Friday\'s indictment went well beyond merely hacking the Clinton campaign and Democratic campaign committees. From one state election board, the Russians managed to steal information on 500,000 voters, Rosenstein said, although he did not identify which state. Trump won the 2016 election by winning three key states by slim margins that added up to around 80,000 votes.\n\n>...An American congressional candidate allegedly asked for, and received, stolen documents about his or her opponent from the Russians. \n\n>...A journalist allegedly discussed with the Russian front account, Guccifer 2.0, about when to release stolen documents related to Black Lives Matter. \n\n>...Russian hackers targeted Clinton emails the same day Trump called for them to find "missing" emails.\n\n**July 27, 2016, remember the date. Candidate Trump publicly asked Russia for their help to hack Hillary Clinton, Russia obliged.**\n\nDuring a campaign rally in Florida on July 27, 2016, President Trump called on Russia to help him find Hillary Clinton\'s missing 30,000 emails.^[[4]](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html) Special Counsel Mueller\'s new indictment against 12 Russian Intelligence Officers found that on July 27, 2016 Russian hackers known as Guccifer 2.0 hacked Hillary Clinton\'s emails.\n\n*DoJ Indictment of 12 Russian Intelligence Officers Pg. 7 - 8*\n\n>The Conspirators spearphished individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign throughout the summer of 2016. For example, on or about July 27, 2016, the Conspirators attempted after hours to spearphish for the first time email accounts at a domain hosted by a thirdparty provider and used by Clinton’s personal office. At or around the same time, they also targeted seventy-six email addresses at the domain for the Clinton Campaign. \n\n**June 9, 2016 - A month before candidate Trump publicly asked for help from a foreign adversary, his surrogates met with Russian operatives at the now infamous Trump Tower meeting.**\n\nOne of the Russian operatives present at the infamous Trump Tower meeting, Rinat Akhmetshin, has ties to Russian intelligence and has a history of being embroiled in  court cases related to hacking campaigns. He also has ties to Paul Manafort.^[[5]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/21/us/rinat-akhmetshin-russia-trump-meeting.html?referer=)\n\n>He has an association with a former deputy head of a Russian spy service, the F.S.B., and a history of working for close allies of President Vladimir V. Putin. Twice, he has worked on legal battles for Russian tycoons whose opponents suffered sophisticated hacking attacks, arousing allegations of computer espionage.\n\n>Few episodes from Mr. Akhmetshin’s past seem more relevant to Mr. Mueller’s investigation than his work for two Russian billionaires accused of infiltrating their adversaries’ computers during nasty legal battles.\n\n>The Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 took place less than a week before revelations that hackers had penetrated the Democratic National Committee’s computers and obtained a trove of emails. Investigators have traced digital espionage to Russian spy agencies. \n\n>During the same period that Mr. Akhmetshin was accused of being involved in various hacking schemes, he appears to have been nurturing a relationship with Viktor Ivanov, once the deputy head of Russia’s intelligence service, the F.S.B., and until last year a top aide to Mr. Putin.\n\n\n>Mr. Akhmetshin told journalists that he was a longtime acquaintance of Paul J. Manafort, who served as a high-paid consultant to Mr. Yanukovych for years before becoming chairman of the Trump campaign.\n\n**August 22, 2017 Senate Intelligence Committee Testimony that the Trump campaign accepted regular intelligence from the Kremlin**\n\nThe Senate Judiciary committee testimony of Fusion GPS CEO Glenn Simpson was released unilaterally by Senator Feinstein because Republicans refused. Simpson confirms that the Trump campaign likely received foreign intelligence aid during the 2016 campaign as Manafort had close ties to Russian Intelligence.^[[6]](https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/3/9/3974a291-ddbe-4525-9ed1-22bab43c05ae/934A3562824CACA7BB4D915E97709D2F.simpson-transcript-redacted.pdf)\n\n*Pg. 154 - 155 Senate Judiciary Committee Testimony*\n\n>A. I mean, one of the key lines here in the second paragraph says "However, he and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his democratic and other political rivals." So the issue with the Trump Tower meeting, as 1 I understand it, is that the Trump people were eager to accept intelligence from a foreign government about their political rivals and that is, you know, I would say, a form of interference. If you\'re getting help from a foreign government and your help is intelligence, then the foreign government\'s interfering. I mean, you know, I think that also -- of course, in retrospect we now know this was pretty right on target in terms on what it says. So anyway --\n\n>Q. In reference to you think that particular sentence?\n\n>A. I mean, it clearly refers to, you know, them being interested in and willing to -- it depicts them as accepting information. What we have seen to date with the disclosures this year is they were at a minimum super interested in getting information.\n\n>Q. And when you\'re referencing the "disclosures this year," could you just be specific about that.\n\n>A. The Trump Tower meeting.\n\n>Q. So with reference to the June 9th Trump Tower meeting?\n\n>A. Yes. Yes.\n\n**July 13, 2018 Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats warns of devastating cyber threats to U.S. infrastructure.**\n\nThe President of the United States does not care to protect Americans from ongoing Russian aggression.

On the contrary, today during their joint press conference it was once again suggested that Putin and Trump should create a joint cybersecurity unit between Russia and the U.S.\n\n**February 16, 2018 Special Counsel Mueller\'s indictment of 13 Russian nationals and 3 Russian entities.**\n\nEarlier this year Special Counsel Mueller indicted 13 Russian nationals and 3 Russian entities for election interference.^[[1]](https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download) The Russian election meddling operation was a sophisticated attack against the West. This operation was funded through Russian fronts, including a catering company run by a close friend of Putin, Yevgeny Prigozhin. They used stolen American identities. Operatives bought political ads on social media sites. Operatives visited the United States, traveled across 9 states and discussed escape routes if they were caught inside the country. Operatives bought equipment including burner phones and SIM cards. The operation included hundreds of employees and millions of dollars, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein put it best  - the Russians conducted information warfare during the election.^[[2]](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-43092569/russians-conducted-information-warfare-on-us-election) According to the indictment Prigozhin met Mikhail Bystrov, a leader of the Internet Research Agency (IRA), regularly in 2015 and 2016. Prigozhin funded the Internet Research Agency and their meddling of the American election. This was a sophisticated operation that spanned over several years. Prigozhin has been Putin\'s go to guy for under the table missions, including recruiting mercenaries for the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria.\n\n*DoJ indictment of 13 Russians and 3 entities Pg. 12 - 19*\n\n>**Object of the Conspiracy;**\n\n> 28.. The conspiracy had as its object impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful government functions of the United States by dishonest means in order to enable the Defendants to interfere with US political and electoral processes, including the 2016 US presidential election.  \n\n>**Manner and Means of the Conspiracy:**\n\n> 29.. Starting at least in or around 2014, Defendants and their co-conspirators began to track and study groups on US social media sites dedicated to US politics and social issues. In order to gauge the performance of various groups on social media sites, the ORGANIZATION tracked certain metrics like the group\'s size, the frequency of content places by the group, and the level of audience engagement with that content, such as the average number of comments or responses to  a post. \n\n\n\n>a. KRYLOVA and BOGACHEVA, together with other defendants and co-conspirators, planned travel itineraries, purchases equipment (such as cameras, SIM cards, and drop phones), and discussed security measures (including "evacuation scenarios") for Defendants who traveled to the United States. \n\n\n>**Use of US Social Media Platforms**\n\n>32.. Defendants and their co-conspirators, through fraud and deceit, created hundres of social media accounts and used them to develop certain fictitious US personas into "leader[s] of public opinion" in the United States. \n\n>**Use of US Computer Infrastructure**\n\n>39.. To hide their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation, Defendants and their co-conspirators - particularly POLOZOV and the ORGANIZATION\'s IT department - purchases space on computer servers located inside the United States in order to set up virtual private networks ("VPNs"). Defendants and their co-conspirators connected from Russia to the US based infrastructure by way of these VPNs and conducted activity inside the United Sates - including accessing online social media accounts, opening new accounts, and communicated with real US persons - while masking the Russian origin and control of the activity. \n\n>40.. Defendants and their co-conspirators also registered and controlled hundreds of web-based email accounts hosted by US email providers under false names so as to appear to be US persons and groups. From these accounts, Defendants and their co-conspirators registered or linked to online social media accounts in order to monitor them; posed as US persons when requesting assistance from real US persons; contacted media outlets in order to promote activities inside the United States; and conducted other operations, such as those set forth below. \n\n>**Use of Stolen US Identities**\n\n>41.. In or around 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators also uses, possessed, and transferred, without lawful authority, the social security numbers and dates of birth of real US persons without those persons\' knowledge or consent. Using these means of identification, Defendants and their co-conspirators opened accounts at PayPal, a digital payment service provider; created false means of identification, including fake driver\'s licenses; and posted on ORGANIZATION - controlled social media accounts using the identities of these US victims. \n\n>**Actions Targeting the 2016 US Presidential Election**\n\n>42.. By approximately May 2014, Defendants and their co-conspirators discussed efforts to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election. Defendants and their co-conspirators began to monitor US social media accounts and other sources of information about the 2016 US presidential election. \n\n>43.. By 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used their fictitious online personas to interfere with the 2016 US presidential election. They engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump. \n\n>45.. Defendants and their co-conspirators also used false US personas to communicate with unwitting members, volunteers, and supporters of the Trump Campaign involved in local community outreach, as well as grassroots groups that supported then-candidate Trump. These individuals and entities at times distributed the ORGANIZATION\'s materials through their own accounts via retweets, reposts, and similar means. Defendants and their co-conspirators then monitored the propagation of content through such participants. \n\n>46.. In or around the latter half of 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, through their ORGANIZATION-controlled personas, began to encourage US minority groups not to vote in the 2016 US presidential election or to vote for a third-party US presidential candidate. \n\n>47.. Starting in or around the summer of 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators also began to promote allegations of voter fraud by the Democratic Party through their fictitious US personas and groups on social media. Defendants and their co-conspirators purchased advertisements on Facebook to further promote the allegations. \n\n>**Political Advertisements**\n\n>48.. From at least April 2016 through November 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, while concealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation through false personas, began to produce, purchase, and post advertisements on US social media and other online sites expressly advocating for the election of then-candidate Trump or expressly opposing Clinton. Defendants and their co-conspirators did not report their expenditures to the Federal Election Commission, or register as foreign agents with the US Department of Justice. \n\n**March 15, 2018 U.S. Department of Homeland Security Computer Emergency Readiness Team - Russian Government Cyber Activity Targeting Energy and Other Critical Infrastructure Sectors^[[3]](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A)**\n\n>This joint Technical Alert (TA) is the result of analytic efforts between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). This alert provides information on Russian government actions targeting U.S. Government entities as well as organizations in the energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation, and critical manufacturing sectors. It also contains indicators of compromise (IOCs) and technical details on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by Russian government cyber actors on compromised victim networks. DHS and FBI produced this alert to educate network defenders to enhance their ability to identify and reduce exposure to malicious activity.\n\n>DHS and FBI characterize this activity as a multi-stage intrusion campaign by Russian government cyber actors who targeted small commercial facilities’ networks where they staged malware, conducted spear phishing, and gained remote access into energy sector networks. After obtaining access, the Russian government cyber actors conducted network reconnaissance, moved laterally, and collected information pertaining to Industrial Control Systems (ICS).\n\n________________\n\n1) [Justice Department - Indictment of 13 Russians and 3 entities](https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download)\n\n2) [BBC - Russians conducted \'information warfare\' on US election](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-43092569/russians-conducted-information-warfare-on-us-election)\n\n3) [Department of Homeland Security: United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) - Russian Government Cyber Activity Targeting Energy and Other Critical Infrastructure Sectors](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A)'

"The thing with crypto is that you can only get your money out when some one is buying in. That's why it is currently more prospective than a currency at this moment. I'm not saying its impossible, but it may be the riskiest money laundering scheme I have ever heard of. If they cashed out like Dec of 2017 then they won big though, so it's not all bad."
'What stat? You mean freedom, success, property? '
'You are right, they would ideally cash out immediately, to get hopefully close to what was agreed upon. The problem shows up again when they put the money back into an American bank account. Large transactions are often recorded as we have seen with Cohen\'s SARs. At that point, might as well write \'em a check and say "totally legitimate" on the memo line.

'In Mueller\'s investigation they could be completed by court order for the BS " attorney client privilege" that Don Jr. was spouting.

"First of all, didn't the watergate investigation take 2 years? \n\nRegardless of Trump and his team, considering the investigation is about a forein government trying to medle in the election and destroy trust in democracy, a year is not that long. Do you think a former KGB agent is going to make things easy to figure out?\n\nThe Investigation about wether a vacation Trudeau (I'm Canadian) took broke ethic rules took a just over year despite everyone knowing what happened most, if not all, of the time. \n\nHe didn't check to see if going on Vacation to a private island with a really rich politically minded guy was OK. Turns out it wasn't."
'The Constitution requires the POTUS to uphold the law and the Constitution itself.  If he\'s pardoning co-conspirators essentially as a means of obstructing justice where he\'s involved in the underlying crime(s), then there\'s a good argument to invalidate those pardons as a reasonable and necessary check on the Presidential pardon power.  (For example, a POTUS shouldn\'t be able to tell someone "Go commit such-and-such crime for my benefit, and if you\'re caught I\'ll pardon you.")\n\nThe "Nixon as unindicted co-conspirator" tack wasn\'t really exercised because Ford ended up as POTUS and issued the pardon, and Ford wasn\'t involved in Watergate.'
"This is exactly what I think will happen.  And while the President may attempt to pardon key people (namely his children), there will be legal challenges to that authority and quite possibly his federal pardon power will be reigned in.  Also, that doesn't stop NY State from charging people and no governor of NY is going to pardon members of that group."
"I'd have to do a lot of research before I'd feel comfortable making that call. That said, I probably lean towards yes. I think Mueller is going to talk to Trump one way or the other, and I'd rather it be by informal interview than subpoenaed and under oath."
">Is the Secret Service really going to let the President be placed into custody for this purpose?\n\n\nConsidering the oath they take, I'd say yes. \n\n\nUnited States Secret Service Oath\n\n“I, [name], do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.”\n\n\n"
'Thankfully law enforcement has enough sense to work things like this out before having a wild west showdown on the white house lawn, and since law enforcement enforces the law, it would be decided by the courts before hand, and the oaths they took to uphold the constitution and the law would come in to play.'

"I trust the GOP to do what is in their best interest to be re-elected while avoiding going to jail. Honestly I hope the investigation drags out past the mid terms and impeachment finds it's case in the newly 75% controlled democrat infested congress XD"
"I don't trust Gorsuch either but he's one of nine justices. The two best precedents are Nixon v. US (holding that executive privilege will not protect the president from releasing tape recordings) and Clinton v. Jones (ruling that a sitting president is not above the law and can be sued in civil court for actions taken before he became president). Those were decided 8-0 and 9-0 against the president. If this goes to the Supreme Court, IMO there's not much question about how it gets resolved."

Jordan tried to play it off like “pshhh suuuuure, a drunk guy in London” but that limp response was all he could muster. \n\nTruth is the best disinfectant. Release it all!'
"Innocent people don't want an investigation shutdown. If anything, they want that investigation to go as in-depth as possible so that they can be cleared of any wrongdoing. If Trump really was innocent of wrongdoing (IMO he's not), he and the GOP would be praising Mueller for trying to uncover the facts of the matter. Instead, they and Russia are attempting to slander and discredit the investigation that seems to be uncovering all sorts of things they would rather have stay in the dark."
'greetings  \n\xa0  \nEDIT: lol this blew up'
"I make a habit of checking Fox News about once a week to see what techniques they are using to dupe their followers and seed prejudgement before the present what little information they actually provide. I was surprised to see this FISA story this morning, and until this thread I was confused about only one thing:\n\n* Why wasn't the information in this memo, whatever it says, discussed at all before the recent Senate and House votes which passed continued (and perhaps expanded) surveillance? Why does this come out less than a week after voting yes on something?\n\nBut after reading this thread (what little information is here, other than evidence that Russian bots are in support of a release the memo hashtag), I now additionally wonder:\n\n* Hypothetically, what kind of information contained in this memo would give support (or cause) to dismantle the Russia investigation? Surely when there is an investigation of the sort we're undertaking, it would be understandable to have lots of requests to a FISA court for surveillance? And wouldn't those requests be coming from the investigating bodies?\n\nIt's all very confusing. Wouldn't it have to be individually damning for targeting for something to rise to the level of calling for removal of a person or persons from the FBI? For example, if Investigator X was running FISA requests on his own ex-girlfriend or something.\n"
"The memo has been classified as Top Secret. In order to release it legally, a number of steps have to be taken, including a vote by the House Intelligence Committee and allowing the Administration a brief period to review and raise objections. Also - the memo has only been viewed in a secure facility so it's likely that no one going on record actually has a copy of the memo available to leak.\n\nOr - following the *Feinstein Protocol*, they can simply get a doctor's note saying they have a cold. Then they would be free to post it on their Twitter feed."
'A bunch of people in government have been saying this circulating memo is incredibly damning because it describes what one guy called "KGB"-like government surveillance. On who or what is not immediately clear, but TD is assuming its confirming Trump was wiretaped like he claimed. Fox news has started heavily running the story at the same time linked russian accounts have started circulating it online. The OP seems convinced this is a smokescreen with which Trump might use to disband the special counsel\'s investigation. '

'What your cult mind fails to recognize, is that building a case like this happens in stages... Like a play or a movie. \n\nStage one set the story in motion. Our country was influenced by foreign agents, too smart for our own right wing oligarchs, and they worked together to establish power and earn a loyal cult of personality from their simple minded followers. You found an identity in the base imagery and catchy head apparel, and stepped in line like a mentally disadvantaged sheep from Wallace and Gromit. \n\nStage two is where the story arc starts to level out. Static and dynamic characters begin to take shape. We see who is going to find their moral center and fall on the sword for the greater good. And who will fail to evolve, and go down with the proverbial ship.  \n\nStage three is coming. Its the best part. Youre gonna wanna close up Infowars, and give the screen your full undivided attention (Im guessing youll never see the M. Night twist on this one). \n\nPeople like you are extras in this feature. You help color the background atmosphere of all those on the wrong side of history.

Nobody remembers your face, but you add to the encompassing sense of hate and weakness (in reality youre likely just some troll farmer from Russia or Idaho, but the overarching point still stands). \n\nThe way this ends is, the political pendulum swings back hard and a new center is found, much closer to true north in the ethical sense. Your "movement" has basically only served to shine a black light on the semen stains of our political culture. Mueller and his team are housekeeping for Motel USA.

Also, Russia Israeli trade and business has gone up 12% since all of this 😤"
">But is anyone reporting to proper non-corrupt agents what Jared is getting access to?\n\nProbably not... but my educated guess is Mueller knows, regardless.  \n\n> CIA agent recently say this was the most corrupt administration he's ever seen?\n\nIf I recall correctly, it wasn't just a CIA agent. It was former Director of Central Intelligence John Brennan.\n\n"
"People, yes. But he didn't volunteer; they showered him in cash like a Russian hooker. "
'They likely will play the ‘we wanted to stop him but the Democrats wouldn’t let us’ card.  \n\nThat will play well with the NeverTrump Republicans, and will seem plausible as an escape hatch for the Trumpians who want out. '
'Pence would be poor candidate. He would carry the baggage of the impeachent/resignation and not have the advantage of running a an incumbent (this cost Ford). Unlike Trump he\'s a poor public speaker, uncharismatic. He\'s not very competent, he\'s an religious extremist. He would lose.\n\nIf Trump runs he will probably be re-elected (do not wish this but it is what it ise) *if* the economy holds up. Advantages:\n\n* Generally, people get tired of Party X if it\'s been in power for eight years or more. The new party then is usually given a full eight years before the people get tired of *them*. The one exception is Carter (before that, Grover Cleveland, and I\'m not even sure about that). This greatly favors Trump.\n\n* Remember, some people voted for Al Gore but then decided "Well, after seeing George W. Bush\'s first term, I\'m switching to him" (!) If *George Bush* can do this then Trump can.\n\n* Trump is a *terrible* President, but he\'s an excellent public speaker and a good campaigner.\n\n* We can assume the same treatment from Russian bots and trolls, and the same voter suppression. An maybe the Russians can hack the voting machines,\n\nIf the economy tanks, Trump will lose anyway. If it\'s pretty good, he\'ll probably win. If there\'s a big Muslim terrorist attack in America near the election, he will win in a landslide. Pence would probably lose.'
'Well, he was asked if it affected the election and he said he wouldn\'t get into the impact, but they didn\'t see evidence that votes were changed.\n\nUnder the way he\'s defining it, he\'s allowing that enough Americans may have chosen Trump or shown up for Trump because of propaganda that it put him over the top, but they aren\'t even attempting to assess that.  I sincerely don\'t know if I believe him or not, but I can understand why they might not get into such a tough hypothetical questions like "Would people have elected Trump anyway absent Russian propaganda".'
"If Trump is removed I doubt Pence would even run. \n\n> excellent public speaker\n\nTrump is a terrible public speaker by any objective measure. He rambles endlessly and can barely form a coherent sentence. BING BING BING. I'll grant that his speaking is POPULAR with his base.\n\nThe investigation is still a big wild card. Anything could happen."
'That sounds like a big number, but look at his razor thin victory margin and his abysmal public approval rating. Primaries are decided by party loyalists but generals are decided by independents and swing voters.\n\nBesides, the other shoe has yet to drop. '
'Well i mean popular *is* good, almost by definition, when you\'re talking about public speaking with the intent to persuade. \n\nTrump has a way of ending statements with like "...and it\'s very, very easy. We\'re going to do it and we\'re going to do it very quickly". He drops his pitch and volume in a "turning away" way that communicates "I mean of course we\'re going to do it. That\'s so obviously true that it\'s really not even worth saying. Only an idiot can\'t see that. You\'re not a idiot, are you?" It\'s the equivalent of a math professor handwaving with "...and after that, the solution is trivial".\n\nJust because he\'s a bad *person* doesn\'t mean he\'s a bad *campaigner*. He is. I mean Hitler was an effective public speaker too.'
"Hitler's skill as an orator puts Trump to absolute shame. They're not even in the same league. You don't even have to speak German to grok the difference, e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnpTWKKWQ1o He's one of history's greatest monsters but he's also a damn good orator.\n\nWhat they DO have in common in their speaking is the effective use of [demagoguery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogue).\n\n*better video"
"I won't discount the possibility that he wins another term. I won't even discount the possibility that he calls for a violent revolt, or moves to amend the constitution to eliminate presidential term limits and fixes however many elections he lives for. I didn't think he had a chance in hell of being president but here he is in all his orange glory. I'm confident things will get better, somebody, but they could get a lot worse in the meantime.\n\nThis is interesting reading, and slightly comforting, given that demagogues historically usually come to bad end, but discomforting to think about who they take with them https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogue"
'This sounds like a Fox and Friends livetweet, not that that makes it any better.'
'This is definitely what a totally innocent, sane, and stable person would say about the matter.'
"I love that it keeps him up at night but also wish we could just get policies that aren't screwing people over (except for the super rich). "
'He repeats these things because people remember things they hear repeatedly. He is attempting to convert these falsehoods into truths in the minds of his supporters. That way, when he abuses his power to hinder the investigation, those supporters will remember the words “witch hunt” and think he’s doing the right thing.\n\nHe doesn’t need to convince you, or me, or anyone else who thinks critically. He just has to keep convincing his base that he’s right and everyone else is wrong, because even though that’s completely false, the republicans will stick with him while he holds sway with their voters.\n\nIt’s the same reason campaign slogans are short, simple and repeated ad nauseam... because it’s effective.'
"Laws didn't stop him from fucking a 13-year-old girl, but he won't fuck with the DOJ/FBI because he's so courteous."
"> The fact that he’s complaining about the expense would be laughable if it weren’t being used as a pretext for obstruction of justice. \n\nThe fact that the complaints about the expense are coming from a guy that forces the US taxpayers to fork out [$3.6M every weekend so that he can go to Mar-a-Lago](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/18/center-american-progress-action-fund/how-much-do-donald-trumps-trips-mar-lago-cost/) is what's really laughable.\n\nHe cares about the expense of the investigation about as much as he cares about Jeff Sessions' feelings."
'The daily show used to be awesome at this.'
'President Trump literally chose to believe the word a foreign dictator over American intelligence agencies. Then he refused to enforce sanctions adopted with near-unanimous approval by Congress. All the while, he lied to the American people telling them that Russia never meddled in our election.\n\nThen yesterday, the intelligence that he has had access to *this entire time* was revealed and it turns out he chose Russia over America. How is that not being a traitor???\n\nAnyone who still supports President Trump is knowingly supporting someone who has placed the interests of himself and Russia before his own country. How is that any different than being a traitor themselves?'

'Look at you ready to sell out the US.\n\nI hope you are not an American. Because that’s... you know....\n\n'

For real, this story really should just be taken down by the mods, or at least downvoted to a Bolivian. \n\nI’m editing this now because it looks like the guardian and cnn are reporting it too. does seem to be true. However, i’m still all for down voting this story to ‘a Bolivian.’ (Voice recognition sometimes takes what I meant to say and makes it much better)'

'To set precedence.  The smaller ones can’t defend themselves.  I’ve been on YouTube for a while and have seen the shift from homegrown content providers to legency providers like ABC, NBC, Fox, etc.  They seem to be paying to have their content pushed to the top squeezing out the smaller ones.  It is a shame because the indies were not beholden to large corporate advertisers.  They have gone after the big ones as well like PewDiePie.  What they do is demonetize their content during the first few days of posting, it gets reviewed and put back on but the views have already happened.

"Former POTUS Nixon was pardoned pre-emptively, before any charges were brought against him.  What's stopping Donald from doing that? He could issue a pre-emptive blanket pardon for any and all federal crimes committed by Michael  Cohen, no?\n\nEither Donald isn't aware he can do that, or he has no intention of pardoning him.  If Donald pardons Michael, then Michael can not use the 5th. Incriminating himself is impossible at that point, and he would be compelled to testify.\n\nIs that the fly in the ointment?  Sorry, not really up on US law."
'He will still gas light the shit out of us.'
"Michael Cohen is in an impossible situation.  He's sandwiched between a corrupt mob-boss of a President and the unlimited resources of S.C. Mueller.  And he has done some awful things for himself and many others.\n\nAs powerful as the Presidency is, it's not unlimited.  As many have mentioned, Trump could issue a pardon for any and all crimes committed at the federal level. And while this might be great for Dinesh Douchebag D'souza, who had a quite uncomplicated conviction to vacate, Michael Cohen is another story. \n\nMichael Cohen is likely staring at not only federal charges but charges in other jurisdictions.  That includes NY state and who knows what other states.  It's not like Michael Cohen only committed crimes in New York.  In addition, he likely has committed crimes in other countries and is eligible to be extradited.  On top of that, even if Cohen is pardoned at the federal level, that doesn't make all of the evidence taken from his office, home, etc. go away.  It's still there and it implicates dozens, probably hundreds of other people.\n\nBottom line, Michael Cohen, like Paul Manafort, is a treasure trove of information and evidence and whether they receive a federal pardon or not is almost immaterial."
"Yo I know it feels like that, but you need to remember that nearly 50&#37; of the country does not vote.  Considering Spanky and Hillary nearly split the election, that's 25&#37; each.    \n\n\nIt's very important to recognize that vast majority that doesn't vote because it absolutely caused Spanky to win. If no one votes, and there's a surge of any kind (including a surge of a bunch of assholes), then that surge can easily put someone over the top.  "
'**Michael Cohen is an American attorney who worked as a lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump. Prior to that he was a Vice President of the Trump Organization.**\n\n**The Trump–Russia dossier, published in January 2017, alleges that Cohen met with Russian officials in Prague, Czech Republic in 2016 with the objective of paying those who had hacked the DNC and to "cover up all traces of the hacking operation".** Cohen has denied the allegations against him, stating that he was in Los Angeles between August 23 and 29, and in New York for the entire month of September. According to a Czech intelligence source, there is no record of him entering Prague by plane, but Respekt magazine and Politico pointed out that he could have entered by car or train from a neighboring country within the Schengen Area, for example Italy. In the latter case, a record of Cohen entering the Schengen zone from a non-Schengen country should exist.\n\n**However, on April 13, 2018, the DC Bureau of McClatchy Newspapers reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has evidence that Cohen did travel to Prague during the late-summer of 2016, with two sources having confirmed this secret trip. The evidence is said to show that Cohen entered the Czech Republic from Germany, and since both countries are in European Union\'s Schengen passport area, Cohen would not have received a passport stamp to enter Czech territory.** The following day, Cohen again denied he has "ever been to Prague". Cohen also said that he didn\'t travel to the European Union in August 2016.\n\n**In late January 2017, Cohen met with Ukrainian opposition politician Andrey Artemenko and Felix Sater at the Loews Regency in Manhattan to discuss a plan to lift sanctions against Russia.** The proposed plan would require that Russian forces withdraw from eastern Ukraine and that Ukraine hold a referendum on whether Crimea should be "leased" to Russia for 50 or 100 years. **Cohen was given a written proposal in a sealed envelope that he delivered to then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn in early February.**\n\n**On April 3, 2017, Cohen was appointed a National Deputy Finance Chairman of the Republican National Committee.** In April 2017, Cohen also formed an alliance with Squire Patton Boggs for legal and lobbying counsel on behalf of Trump.\n\nIn May 2017, amidst expanding inquiries into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, two congressional panels asked Cohen to provide information about any communications he had with people connected to the Russian government. **He was also a subject of the Mueller investigation in 2018.**\n\n**In 2017, an LLC that Cohen established received $500,000 from Columbus Nova, a US offshoot of businesses owned by Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg.** Vekselberg is a business partner of Soviet-born billionaire and major Republican Party donor, Leonard Blavatnik. **In March 2018, members from Robert Mueller\'s team of special counsel investigators questioned Vekselberg at a New York area airport. In April 2018, the United States imposed sanctions on him and 23 other Russian nationals.**'

'>The Hague\n\nThe best option.'
'Again this is all just speculation hypothetical but what the heck...If Trump pardons, I assume it will be a "blanket" pardon for "all crimes."  Then all that is left is state level charges in New York *if* those can even be brought.\n\nOn the other hand, Cohen spills the beans before he is pardoned because he gets spooked that he won\'t get one.  But even if this happens we don\'t even know what beans he has to spill.\n\nRight now he just seems to be trolling for reactions either from prosecutors or from Trump. '

"Honestly? If Mueller completely exonerates Trump, that would be fantastic. It would mean that he *didn't* try to manipulate the result of the election with foreign help, and that his presidency is just a normal mis-firing of the electoral college. \n\nBut that outcome is looking less and less likely every day."

"I think there is a breaking point. And I think you are starting to see some of that on the Senate side. The republican base is a demographic time bomb. And at some point in time, the plutocrats who fund the machine-e.g. Koch Bros- are going to realize the shoe will inevitably be on the other foot.\n\nIn the context of that other great historical republic, it is worthy to note that Caesar's ascension (who rose to power as a force for the plebian 'little guy'), would not have been possible had in not been for the preceding Dictatorship of Sulla (who represented the interests of Patrician monied interests). One instability lead to the other, and eventually to the demise of the constitution altogether.  Our countries founders, whom were avid historians (remember vol. I of Gibbon was published in 1776)  were deeply afraid of just such a scenario, which is why we have the system of checks and balances in the first place.   \n\nGood example of this in the present context, are the drastic reduction of state income tax offsets-- basically forcing the blue states to fund the tax cuts for the rich Republican party backers.  So imagine the wheel turns and the Democrats have the house, senate and executive.  Whats going to happen when they want to restore the deduction and fund it with say... a massive tax hike on the oil industry.   \n\nPoint is that you get too far afield from the system of checks and balances -- even under this administration -- you risk an equal but opposite reaction when the shoe is on the other foot, which history says will eventually happen. \n\nThis is a longwinded way of saying that the breaking point will not come from the party hacks. It will instead come from the mega-rich, who will simply get scared.  And even if change doesnt happen immediately, and especially under the present regime, they would do especially well to remember the fate of Mikhail Khodorkovsky in Putin's Russia. "

I was under the impression that Carter Page was under surveillance but specifically it was NOT a FISA?  There is nothing in Moscow Project to prove 2014 was a FISA other than their headline.  Can anyone else provide evidence for that claim because I think its an important distinction.  \n"

The Twenty-fifth Amendment was adopted on February 10, 1967.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'
'It’s “to”, genius. Now you don’t care what he has to say? And yes, I do pay attention when even the Breitbart guy who was central to Trump’s campaign admits that Mueller will be Trump’s undoing. '
'Yes, I see. The old: "I want to discredit you, but I don\'t actually know anything. \n\nLet me attack the left wing political ideology. That\'s a good idea."\n\nQuite nice, well done.'
'This haha.  I knew he had been working as a foreign agent for Turkey, but I didn’t know about the kidnapping.  There is way too much to keep up with at this point, luckily we have Mueller to work on it'

'I thank you, kind Reddit user, for understanding what a disgraceful mess our politics are in at the moment and what kind of hand we were dealt. I am relieved to see the sympathy non-Americans have expressed to those of us Americans who find our president anathema to common decency and the rule of law. \n\nMy rhetoric makes clear that I am not sympathetic to Trump. And as much as I cannot stand the man, I do find myself suspiciously fascinated by this new era in American political discourse. There is just so, so much from which to be horrified. Put it this way: spend one hour listing the horrible things this president has been caught red handed doing. You will fail to make a complete list. I have enough faith in American institutions that this president will be given what is coming to him. \n\nI just pray that it is served on a platter from the Office of the Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III.'

"Greetings from Slovenia. American/Russian shitfest of politics is about the most interesting thing happening right now in the world; even objectivly speaking.

'I hate to write it, but Trump is the zenith and culmination of 30 years of Republicanism.\n\nSmall government?  Yep, Trump doesn\'t even care if there\'s anyone else but him to run it.   \n\nAnd defund it?  Yep!  Defund it and give the money to people who already have money coming out of their ears because they "work harder".  We\'ll make that a major tax bill and everyone will love it!\n\nAnd religious liberty? Yes, enough religious liberty to simultaneously buy porn star sex every few months and then turn around and chastise "immoral women."\n\nDeregulate?  Yep, to the point where a business can legally tell you to stand, sit, kneel, don\'t kneel, pray, bleed, etc. even if you\'re off the clock and nowhere near your place of employment, and it can take your money with giving NO service and suffering NO justice from it.\n\nTrump is NOT fringe.  Trump IS end game conservatism.  And until conservatives realize this, your party will just fall further and further into oligarchic authoritarianism.'

My foot/tithes/ministry vote goes only to those that remain reverent, mainly referring to the avoidance of political garbage. I’ve voted to shut the doors of two ministries that went political and would never hesitate to do it again. Political churches have nothing to do with God.\n\nThere’s good, intelligent Christians out there, I promise - the political evangelicals are a bug in the religious system that will be patched with the next generation of leadership.'
"They may not show it in public, but no one can convince me Trump has done *nothing* to piss off Republicans. He has certainly given the richest people in the country all of our wealth with their help, but he has also demonstrated a total lack of normality. Republicans don't like that shit."
'I’m glad to hear that sentiment. As a progressive minded atheist I’m upset with Christians. Progressivism and your religion pretty much go hand in hand but nobody reads it that way. We should be strong allies and instead we stand at polar opposites.\nWho wanted to heal the sick? Jesus and Progressives.\nWho wants to feed the hungry? Jesus and Progressives.\nWho wants to help the needy? You get the point.'
'Because I can’t avoid a humorously related idiom.....you’re preaching to the choir.\n\nConservatism should have never been perverted to mean “blame the poor and masturbate to Reagan’s portrait”. It’s supposed to be a secular extension of biblical principles respecting the rights of those outside the faith, all adapted to a policy of fiscal responsibility. (As for whether it ever was that....just let me hold onto one happy lie in these difficult times). Progressivism and Conservatism are supposed to be pieces that go together, not opposites that pull at one another.\n\nOh well. Maybe one day I can believe in balancing the budget without the extra baggage of being expected to hate non-white people.'
'If a balanced budget is your fiscal conservatism, and it doesn’t involve massive tax breaks for the wealthy or cutting social safety net programs we can be fiscal allies as well. I just hold issue if you don’t see a problem with our society not funding healthcare and higher education as a matter of principal. However the fact show that highly educated healthy populations are more financially beneficial to a labor force, so I would assume we have common ground there as well. \n\nI’m glad to meet a non-crazy conservative Christian. I sometimes forget that people like you exist, because the overwhelming majority of my personal experiences with people who share your faith and political identifier are terrifying. So well met indeed, let’s be allies in the fight to make America a better place.'
"I can't help but point out that both Trump and Putin are *very* capitalist, so the hammer and sickle iconography seems kind of... eh."
"This exact sentiment was put out in pics as well. The USSR used the Hmer and Sickle on their flag, and that's where most people know it from. You can say whatever you want about what the Hammer and Sickle is *supposed* to mean, but frankly it's pretty irrelevant considering the USSR used it despite definitely not working towards those ends.\n\nIt's important to note this, because Putin was in the KGB where he worked to support the USSR. He earned all of the negative connotations associated with the USSR and by extension the Hammer and Sickle as it is best known- a symbol of authoritarian rule the style of which Putin is VERY much a fan of."
"That's fair, but honestly, when I think ussr, I think authoritarianism first and communism second"
"You know, I'll be honest, I didn't take Putin's USSR background into consideration. Thank you for bringing that up!"

'I wonder how history books will refer to the Trump era 100 years from now. Or maybe it will just be erased from our history. Hopefully it gets better soon'
'That’s because nobody truly respects him.'
"That's surprising to me. I interacted with a lot of Marines - as my Navy command hosted quite a few - none of them liked Trump. Trump's very unpopular among young people in general; I think you'd have to try pretty hard to find someone that likes him in active duty, so it's surprising that everyone you knew would like him."
"Lmao that's almost as good as learning dragonese "
"I was a part of the intelligent crowd also, like that's the most surprising part. I wasnt motor t or a grunt I was air wing haha"
'The behavior at T_D isn’t so much genuine respect as it is fanatical idolization of somebody upon whose they can project all of their hopes and disdains and always hear a “yes” answer.\n\nThink of it like courtship. When two responsible people see one-another, they have realistic expectations of the other person and respect boundaries, etc.\n\nWhen morally repugnant, emotionally flaccid people (T_Ders) see somebody even remotely appealing, rather than assess the individual, they’ll be more likely to just assume this person is everything they need and more.\n\nTrump’s cult doesn’t respect him. Arguably, they don’t even admire him. Most accurately, they fetishize him and the idea of his presidency because it gives them hope they’ll get what they want.'
"Ah, gotcha. I was a cook so I pretty much interacted with everyone, I wasn't really limited to just one part of the crew."
'Trump immediately responded, "Thanks, Vladdy!"\n\nThe funny thing about this is that if he had just come out, told the American people, and resigned before he could be inaugurated, he\'d be seen as a fucking American hero by almost everyone. But nope, too desperate for power and money.'

'**Hillary Clinton email controversy**\n\nThe Hillary Clinton email controversy was a major public controversy arising from the use by  Hillary Clinton of her family\'s private email server for official communications during her tenure as United States Secretary of State rather than official State Department email accounts maintained on secure federal servers. Those official communications included over 100 emails which contained classified information (but did not have classification markings) at the time they were sent, as well as 2,093 emails which were not marked classified but would retroactively be ranked as "confidential" by the State Department. Post-election analyses of media coverage during the 2016 presidential campaign show that the Clinton email controversy received the most extensive coverage of any topic.The controversy unfolded against the backdrop of Clinton\'s 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the United States House Select Committee on Benghazi. Some experts, officials, and members of Congress contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures, as well as federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

'> President Donald Trump\'s lead lawyer, John Dowd, has resigned from the President\'s personal legal team handling the response to the Russia investigation.\n\n> Dowd\'s resignation comes as Trump has stepped up his attacks on special counsel Robert Mueller and days after Dowd said in a statement the investigation should end, initially claiming he was speaking for the President before saying he was only speaking for himself.\n\nJumping from the sinking ship.\n\n> "I love the President and wish him well,"\n\nDowd said in a statement to CNN\'s Gloria Borger.\n\n> "John Dowd is a friend and has been a valuable member of our legal team. We will continue our ongoing representation of the President and our cooperation with the Office of Special Counsel," said Jay Sekulow, counsel to the President.\n\n\nFrom the Washington Post \n\n> Trump added former U.S. attorney Joe diGenova to his legal team last week. And on Monday, The Post reported that Trump had urged his aides to reach out to legal superstar and former solicitor general Theodore B. Olson to join as his lawyer as he faces a likely interview with the Special Counsel’s investigative team and scrutiny for possible obstruction of justice.\n\nDowd\'s Statement from last week before his resignation\n\n>“I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe’s boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier,” Dowd said in an emailed statement.'
'The Failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out. Wrong.

"In his mind, trump thinks fighting IS winning. In life, he gets away with it because of the money he has. Even when loses, he never feels it cause he's still rich and he tells himself he won afterwards. So he has spent all of his life acting like a jackass doing anything he wants and thinking he's winning when he's actually losing.\n\nSo for him to say no to mueller's interview is unimaginable. He would view that as losing. His mind works based off on a win/lose mentality and that fighting in of itself is winning. For once in his life maybe he will see what losing really is"
"> I'm sure he quit because of how innocent Trump is, right?\n\nDo you even know how lawyers work?"
'I think trump appearing in front of Mueller could be the very best piece of video ever.'
"At his level they'll decline a paycheck to protect their reputation as well.  Working for the POTUS is fantastic at getting you other high-powered clients as long as it isn't *this* POTUS.  Nobody wants to hire the lawyer whose client was impeached and potentially jailed."
'the prequel was pretty good! '
'I mean a candidate basically colluding with a foreign adversary to win the presidency should be way bigger of a history lesson for generations. But like you said, I feel like the era of post-truth will make it seem just less than important than Watergate was.'
'> I keep imagining a kid learning about all this awful stuff in school and then going home to grandpa to talk about it. Whereupon Grandpa starts ranting about how Trump was the greatest president ever.\n\nI think the vast majority of the MAGA people will distance themselves from Trump once he\'s proven to be completely ineffective (which thankfully he is, barely passing one piece of legislation with both houses of Congress ostensibly on his side) and when Mueller takes him down with hard proof that he worked with Putin they\'ll immediately pretend they never liked him that much anyway.  \n\nThese aren\'t people with long attention spans or strong convictions other than rooting for their "team", once their team has a new captain they\'ll move on from the old one pretty quickly IMHO.'
"> For instance, a lawyer may be required to resign if he knows his client intends to commit perjury. It’s actually a complicated issue when balanced with a lawyer’s duty to zealously defend a client.\n\nLawyer here. This is almost certainly what's going on. It's a signal that Dowd is very, very sure that Trump would commit a crime (e.g., perjury or obstruction of justice). In that circumstance, he would have an ethical obligation to report on his own client. No attorney wants to do that--it's horribly injurious to your reputation and will understandably put you in a ton of hot water with the bar, who's going to micro-analyze everything that led up to the predicament. And if you have a client like Trump, good lord. He would sue you in every way possible.\n\nSo yeah, he's resigning before he triggers his ethical obligation to narc on his boi.\n\nIf I were Dowd, I'd be putting my malpractice insurance carrier on notice ASAP. That would be a hilarious letter. \n\n> Dear Insurance Company, \n\n> You see this shit on the news? Yeah. All that.\n\n> Holla back,\n\n> Johnny D"

"There is a possiblity this might work though.\n\nIt's nowhere near the same level, but I do remember in a table top game I was playing a while back we had one character that was... well the poor dear was just an innocent. She spent so much time in the wilderness she forgot her name, where she came from, and basic morals.\n\nWe were called in by the Sheriff that was played by someone from another table top group.\n\nOur innocent little wilderness trash child in a six foot 250 pound body of muscle, in her rambling openly admitted to no less than three capital offenses, and a myriad of things I assume are misdemeanors.\n\nShe said them with such cheer and sandwiched in so many other things that the Sheriff didn't even notice. She tagged us for some minor infractions and a fine... and that was all she caught.\n\nTrump MIGHT just be so unaware of the law that it trips up investigators because they will be looking for signs of guilt."

"It's more.  She may possible have pictures and text messages.  Trump's supporters will deny this story because they will claim there is no evidence.  If she can break the NDA agreement and release evidence of her relationship with Trump, including the pictures and text messages, it will have huge impacts on his presidency.  Not to mention if there is hard evidence, it can effectively torpedo the Republicans in the November elections (with hard evidence, many Evangelical Christians that held their nose to vote for Trump may decide to sit out the elections in November).\n\nBTW, I see you post often in AskTrumpSupporters and The_Donald.

'You do know that the same "Russia Oligarch" also paid millions to the Clinton\'s. Viktor Vekselberg and his Renova group. The left news sources always say "Russia Oligarch" in a attempt to disconnect him from the Clinton\'s.. but its that same POS. Sounds like he was playing both sides so he could win no matter what.  So basically both Hilary and Trump were paid by Russians.  So that are the same in that sense, except, the Clinton\'s got more....'
"So the Clintons got Viktor Vekselberg to donate to the Clinton Foundation, a legitimate charity that does good work. The Clinton Foundation is a top rated charity by all organizations that independently rate charities. The GOP has had the FBI investigate the Clinton Foundation in 2016 and found nothing.  \n  \nOn the other hand, Viktor Vekselberg put money into Trump's personal lawyer's fake shell company. Cohen is not really a practicing lawyer. He graduated from the worst law school in the country, and has only one client, Trump. Cohen's shell company is used for paying hush money to porn stars and playboy bunnies who needed abortions."
"Where ever there's a Clinton link to Russians, the Trump links are much stronger. The Russian bank hired Podesta group (run by the brother of john podesta) to lobby about sanctions. However, Trump's cabinet secretary, Wilbur Ross, OWNED the bank, and even selected a guy from Deutsche Bank who was busted for Russian money laundering to run the operations at Bank of Cyprus, presumable to launder more Russian money. Manafort had accounts there to launder money. And Wilbur Ross is confirmed to have helped Trump launder Russian money in the 2008 real estate deal with a Russian oligarch who over-paid about $60 million dollars for a Trump mansion. The deal was facilitated by Wilbur Ross, and as soon as the Russian bought it, he bulldozed it, pretty much confirming that it was to launder money. It was the most expensive home sale in the United States."

I don't know, but I would think that the answer would be;\n\n* Yes, he can be granted immunity unilaterally.\n\n* No, he can't be forced to answer if granted that immunity.\n\nBetter to make the immunity contingent on cooperation.\n\nIf that was not the case, prosecutors could just grant a blanket immunity to all people in an organization -- but not their targets.  This could backfire if the people targeted are actually innocent while some of the people given immunity aren't.  At that point, the guilty (non-targeted) would just tell what they did and they would get away with it.\n\nThere are other possible failures if this was possible, but these at least would be an issue."

'*Wall of text, but you did ask...*\n\nThe hacking spree that upended the presidential election wasn’t limited to Democratic National Committee memos and Clinton-aide emails posted on websites. The hacker also privately sent Democratic voter-turnout analyses to a Republican political operative in Florida named Aaron Nevins.\n\nLearning that hacker “Guccifer 2.0” had tapped into a Democratic committee that helps House candidates, Mr. Nevins wrote to the hacker to say: “Feel free to send any Florida based information.”\n\nTen days later, Mr. Nevins received 2.5 gigabytes of Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee documents, some of which he posted on a blog called HelloFLA.com that he ran using a pseudonym.\n\nSoon after, the hacker sent a link to the blog article to Roger Stone, a longtime informal adviser to then-candidate Donald Trump, along with Mr. Nevins’ analysis of the hacked data. \n\nMr. Nevins confirmed his exchanges after The Wall Street Journal identified him first as the operator of the HelloFLA blog and then as the recipient of the stolen DCCC data. The Journal also reviewed copies of exchanges between the hacker and Mr. Nevins. That the obscure blog had received hacked Democratic documents was previously known, but not the extent of the trove or the blogger’s identity.\n\n“I just threw an arrow in the dark,” Mr. Nevins said in an interview, adding he set up a Dropbox account so whoever was using the Guccifer 2.0 name could send large amounts of material. Later, going through what the hacker sent as someone who “actually knows what some of these documents mean,” the GOP consultant said he “realized it was a lot more than even Guccifer knew that he had.”\n\nThe episode shows how the hacker’s activities extended to exposing Democrats’ get-out-the vote strategies in swing states and informing a Trump ally of hacked data during the national campaign.\n\nU.S. officials believe Guccifer 2.0 is linked to Russian military intelligence. Guccifer 2.0 denies that. The moniker appeared in hacks last year and isn’t the same as a Romanian hacker who earlier used the “Guccifer” name.\n\nA Federal Bureau of Investigation counterintelligence inquiry and congressional committees are looking into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The Kremlin denies any election meddling, including any link to Guccifer 2.0. Mr. Stone has come under scrutiny in the counterintelligence inquiry, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Stone denied any involvement with the Russians related to elections and said he hadn’t been contacted by the FBI. He confirmed that Guccifer 2.0 sent him a link to the HelloFLA blog article last year but said he didn’t share any hacked material from it with anyone. On his own website, Mr. Stone has posted screenshots of text messages he exchanged with Guccifer 2.0 last summer.\n\nDCCC documents sent to Mr. Nevins analyzed specific Florida districts, showing how many people were dependable Democratic voters, how many were likely Democratic voters but needed a nudge, how many were frequent voters but not committed, and how many were core Republican voters—the kind of data strategists use in planning ad buys and other tactics.\n\nThe Journal reviewed these documents as well as Democratic voter analyses also sent to Mr. Nevins about congressional districts in Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nThe DCCC last summer confirmed a cyberintrusion but hasn’t been specific about what was taken. Asked for comment, DCCC Communications Director Meredith Kelly said federal law enforcement, the intelligence community and members of both parties agree Russia intervened in the presidential and House contests, a reason for “a bipartisan, independent commission to investigate.”\n\nBesides posting some of the hacked material on his blog, Mr. Nevins said he passed some on to Florida journalists. He said he didn’t use any in his consulting business, which includes running grass-roots-style campaigns for corporations and wealthy landowners seeking to influence local politics.\n\nMr. Nevins said the HelloFLA blog, which focuses on Tallahassee political gossip, gets at best 100 readers a day, and he runs it as a hobby.\n\nIn hopes of a scoop, he said, he reached out to Guccifer 2.0 on Aug. 12 after seeing a newspaper article about a hack of the DCCC. The hacker using the Guccifer 2.0 name had invited journalists to send questions via Twitter direct messages, which Mr. Nevins did.\n\nSeeing that some of what Guccifer 2.0 had was months old, Mr. Nevins advised the hacker that releasing fresher documents would have a lot more impact.\n\nMore impressed after studying the voter-turnout models, Mr. Nevins told the hacker, “Basically if this was a war, this is the map to where all the troops are deployed.”\n\nAt another point, he told the hacker, “This is probably worth millions of dollars.”\n\n“Hmmm,” Guccifer 2.0 responded. “ok u owe me a million :)”\n\nDemocrats, Mr. Nevins wrote, “spent millions probably to figure out who these people are that are conducive to their message and now it’s exposed for the other side.”\n\nMr. Stone, to whom Guccifer sent that analysis along with the link to the blog article with DCCC data, wrote to the hacker that the file was “pretty standard,” screenshots of Mr. Stone’s messages show.\n\nIt is impossible to know whether the hack affected the outcome of any elections.\n\n“I did adjust some voting targets based on some data I saw from the leaks,” said Anthony Bustamante, a campaign consultant to Republican congressional candidate Brian Mast. Mr. Bustamante said the Democratic voter analyses led him to amp up some of his TV ad buys and reduce some mailed material ahead of the November election. Mr. Mast won a House seat, previously Democrat-held, in Florida’s 18th district near Palm Beach.\n\nAfter publication, a spokesman for Mr. Mast said Mr. Bustamante stopped working for the Mast campaign on June 30, 2016, before the release of the hacked data, and said he hadn’t made ad buys for the campaign. Asked about that, Mr. Bustamante said he continued to advise the campaign informally after June.\n\nJacob Perry, who managed the Mast general-election campaign, said he wasn’t aware of the use of any hacked data and said it didn’t play a role in the outcome of the race.\n\nRepresentatives of the Florida Republican Party and the National Republican Congressional Committee didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nMr. Nevins said he hasn’t been contacted by any investigators about last year’s political hacking.\n\nHe isn’t convinced the Russians were behind it, Mr. Nevins said, but even if they were, it doesn’t matter to him because the agenda of the hackers seemed to match his own.\n\n“If your interests align,” he said, “never shut any doors in politics.”'

Everyone knew he was a sleazebag already.\n\nIt's kinda like the way they finally nailed Al Capone on financial crimes.\n\nYou use whatever you have, your best tool do accomplish the goal."

Literally takes like 10 seconds of logical thinking to realize you're a loon."

'In what capacity did Cohen represent Hannity? Or is this just a retroactive Hail Mary to claim privilege of all the shady communications between the two over the past couple years?\n\nAnd Lordy, I hope Hannity was part of a distribution list that spotlights other juicy names in this saga!'
"Attorney-client privilege is considered to be almost sacrosanct in the eyes of the law. \n\nIt's actually kind of brilliant: **Use a crooked lawyer to legally firewall nefarious communications.** My God."
'I love Hannity\'s response. "I was just using him for minor legal advice." Right. Cause Michael Cohen is world-renowned for his legal work.'
'Stop! My justice boner can only get so erect!'
'This just gets better and better, ahahahah!'
"As much as I am happy with the news, I am still confused though. Like why are people so happy about it? Is it because Cohen is being investigated, and he also was looking into Sean Hannity case? I mean what is wrong to hire a lawyer of one's choosing. One may argue that Sean Hannity has personal interests that's why he was pushing the Trump's agenda on TV, but we all know about that. We all bash him for that already. I am still confused behind such a surge with people's excitement. Can anyone please explain? Am I missing something? "
">Michael Cohen has never represented me in any matter. I never retained him, received an invoice, or paid legal fees. I have occasionally had brief discussions with him **about legal questions** about which I wanted his input and perspective.\n\nIt's okay. It looks like Sean just wanted an update on Law and Order.  "

"I was confused at first, but from what I've gathered, Cohen is in the business of helping old men cover up their affairs with porn stars via hush money. So Hannity's wife better be suuuuper interested in this. "
'That’s exactly what I think is fascinating. \n\nThis could potentially tie it all together. \n\nYou have Russia leaking the Clinton emails/docs to Wikileaks, you have Hannity communicating with Assange, you have Hannity working with Cohen. \n\nHannity could theoretically play a much larger role in this that we think. 🤔 '

Just a reminder: five convictions and an additional 17 indicted is not a "weak" case.  '
"For a party that's supposedly for 'law & Justice' you know suprisingly little about law. But then again, perhaps that's the real explenation."
"A bare majority of people think the Mueller investigation is fair. If Mueller wants to get those numbers up, he should start leaking information. Public opinion might save him, but right now there won't be much backlash against trump who sits at 45%ish approval ratings.\n\nMueller is too good for us."
'So an interesting tidbit you might add to your amazing citations is that Mueller had a warrant for Manafort’s [phone records](https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Politics/muellers-recent-search-warrant-manafort-case-includes-information/story?id=54296092) including multiple phone numbers.  What is interesting about this is that he collected call and location data for each of these numbers.  My guess is that Mueller has gotten warrants for the phones of many other players in this conspiracy which could then put them in certain places at certain times.  This, coupled with CC-TV is likely how Mueller has confirmation that Cohen went to Prague.  Additional contact information obtained from raiding Cohen’s office, house, etc. could have provided additional names paired with phone numbers for different players in this whole affair.'

"> The Clinton and Trump cases have been handled completely different by the FBI.\n\nI agree completely. In one case, the FBI had a massive investigation open for over a year into the one of the biggest crimes against America and we didn't hear a peep about it until 6 months after the election. In the other case there was a computer that wasn't set up using recommended best practices and the FBI continually leaked drivel like the fact they looked at another email today and decided it was boring too.

"Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. Unless you're friends with the president."
'I’m aware of all of this, and agree. It only furthers my point. The president cannot be impeached for pardoning himself because that is a backwards sequence of events. '
'I share it literally daily.  I encourage others to do the same.'
'He can be impeached for whatever congress wants and deems “high crimes and misdemeanors”. Take whatever value you want from that and whether it makes you happy or sad. But pardoning oneself makes a good case of an impeachable obstruction of justice (it would not stand in criminal court—doing one of your privileges as president (issuing pardons) is not a criminal act).'
'I think you are sidestepping the point. The sequence of events is important. He must first be impeached (for whatever congress sees fit) and then convicted (a step Clinton and others never made it to). In order for ANY pardon to occur, a conviction must have occurred. In order for Trump to pardon himself, he would have to be convicted, and that can only come after an impeachment. Therefore, he can’t be impeached for pardoning himself because he would have already been impeached if he was in a position to be eligible for pardon. '
"He can pardon himself before a conviction. Ex Parte Garland (1867) held that his pardon power is “unlimited” and “It extends to every offense known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken, or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment.''\n\nMurphy v. Ford (1975), a district court dismissed the suit against Ford for pardoning Nixon before indictment citing Ex Parte Garland. "
"Doesn't matter, vote anyway. What do you know about your congressional district, is it competitive? Is there at least a primary? On top of that, we need to run up the score on the Republicans, make them scared and have to waste resources defending every seat. \n\nBesides, I love voting, it feels great. Even though I don't live in a competitive district. "
'But a reason why it might not be competitive could be that people *feel* it’s not competitive, and do not vote. Obviously this is an edge case, but I’m sure there are some districts where if people were more energetic about voting the tide would turn. Hopefully he does!'
"Never forget the full circle of corruption in the DNC, Lets go back to 2008! Obama Vs Clinton and Tim Kaine as head of the DNC. So Clinton steps out of the race giving it to Obama which then Obama has Kaine step down as DNC head so that way Obama could appoint Clinton's campaign manager  Debbie Wasserman Schultz to head of the DNC. Which she then helped Clinton in the primary and then Clinton made Kaine her VP. I wonder why Clinton after destroying a Progressives campaign would pick such a moderate Dem and think that would help her win. "
"Pretty sure he also voted to confirm all of Trump's nominees too."
"I'm sorry that's the best VA could produce, buuuuuuuuuut he's the best we could produce at the moment. Relax we're coming around slowly but surely okay."
"The departments don't close down without a nominee. Usually they're run by competent civil servants who believe in the agency's mission. Trumps appointees, on the other hand, seem to despise the agencies they run; their main goal is to dismantle & cripple them as much as possible. Voting down nominees is what's best if you want government to function."

'I agree. People get into law enforcement for a variety of reasons. At least where I live, most of the police are lovely people who deal with the dregs of society all day, take huge amounts of verbal abuse, and still act with compassion where compassion is needed.\n\nSome people get into law enforcement because they want to have power over other people. I feel like the easiest thing to do is weed these people out as soon as possible and then either ban them from working in law enforcement, or, at the very least, give them a desk job where they will be supervised rather than a badge and a gun.\n'

I don’t really care if you spam it, just show him the truth. '
'The problem is the truth doesn’t matter anymore; it’s about competing narratives. Trump will continue to lie and offer an alternate version of reality to appease his base. That’s really all that matters to him now- keeping his base on his side, and if you look at the polls, he has been very successful even after Helsinki he still has 70% approval among Republicans. Trump will continue to undermine the truth and our democracy to keep himself in power including firing Mueller, installing a sympathetic Justice who will side with him when he postpones the 2020 election. Trump only cares about himself; he has no moral character or sense of duty towards his country. It will take a massive populist movement to oust him; similar to what happens on dictatorships. '
"So it comes down to this:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTrump is absolutely, literally, without a doubt, a complete idiot who is so narcissistic and greedy and corrupt and oblivious that he hasn't got a clue that he was suddenly hoisted to the presidency fraudulently by russian spy ring, and doesn't care because he truly believes it's an honest win and he's a legitimate president, and putin's got his back - he's a good old dude...\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOR\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe's a corrupt, narcissistic piece of shit who has been dirty dealing with russians for decades, to whom he owes his true allegiances...and was groomed by putin to be a plant / agent / spy for the sole purpose of pulling a fucking coup in the government of the usa...\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd yet people think this is an issue best handled by....voting????\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHope you'll remember that when you wake up on your knees in a camp somewhere."

But whatever, I still dislike Pruitt for his policies so this is not something i really want to debate.  I just prefer it, if you’re going to attack someone, to compare it to legitimate wrongdoing and not gross waste like having the secret service secure 2 personal homes and make 100% of your personal outings to property you profit from.  This is the comparison GP was making, and while a great example of waste, it’s still not illegal on the face of it.'

"I am a lawyer. That's largely correct, though there are broadly two types of subpoenas: those for documents and those for testimony. This appears to be for documents.\n\nI don't have anything to do with criminal law, so I don't 100% stand by the following, but if the process is anything like civil litigation, you generally subpoena documents first. If the documents further support your case, you then subpoena testimony where you ask questions, which are at least partially based on what you learned in the documents. These are broad assumptions because you don't need to subpoena the opposing party in civil litigation (they're required to comply with requests for production of documents without needing a subpoena). That said, the processes and strategies should be fairly similar; the terminology and standards are what tend to vary."

'No one can do what you speak of. Your slightly misinformed on what a pardon can and can’t do. \n\nA presidential pardon doesn’t drop criminal charges because criminal charges imply the person has only been charged not convicted. Being charged is when the police suspect you of a crime but haven’t had a court find you guilty. The president can only pardon someone once they are convicted. Usually the process is for the individual to apply to be pardoned then several people weigh in on it and give recommendations to the president and he makes the final say. Their are downsides to presidential pardons such as the person has to admit guilt to the crime. [source 1](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/politics/presidents-pardon-power-works) \n\n\nOther countries do allow pardons such as Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Iran, and many more I don’t feel like naming [Source 2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon) \n\n\nBack to the US. For state crimes the ability to pardon typically falls to the governors office. Sometimes the governor has sole discretion and sometimes there is a small board that needs to agree with the governor first. \n\n\nAs far as if it’s right or not. The idea behind the presidential pardon stems from the founding fathers themselves. It is used as another form of checks and balances. It helps wipe mistakes made by the judicial system and by prior presidents. Or as one founding father put it a way to heal the nation. Imagine Lincoln pardoning thousands of confederate soldiers to bring peace to the nation. Most presidents don’t abuse the pardon system because of the sanctity of the office they serve.

'Yes but Kurt Russell played Wyatt Earp in Tombstone.. Know your Western history bud'
'**Pardon**\n\nA pardon is a government decision to allow a person who has been convicted of a crime to be free and absolved of that conviction, as if they were never convicted.\n\nToday, pardons are granted in many countries when individuals have demonstrated that they have paid their debt to society, or are otherwise considered to be deserving of them. Pardons are sometimes offered to persons who were either wrongfully convicted or who claim that they were wrongfully convicted. In some jurisdictions, accepting a pardon implicitly constitutes an admission of guilt (see Burdick v.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

'...because people make the laws and citizens want their law enforcers to reflect the "will of the people" instead of being renegade agents with unchecked power. Have you ever learned or thought about basic civics? There\'s also a thing called civilian control of the military. Would you ask "if a general wants to go to war but the public is vigorously opposed, what does it matter? The general should continue anyway." Muller isn\'t investigating as a favor. He\'s drawing a paycheck, a large budget, and enjoys many special prosecutorial privileges and immunities **on behalf of the public**. If the public withdraws support, then he has no legitimacy or office to continue in the public\'s name using the public\'s resources.'
"I'm pretty sure I could offer my congressman $10K to stand up for the special counsel, and he'd just give a blank stare and ask daddy Mitch what to do."
'Investigations like this take a long time. Even watergate took 4 years. With all the guilty pleas and indictments he already has, it suggests he’s actually working at a faster pace than previous political investigations. The only thing you can do to a president is remove him by voting, which is our job, or impeachment in the house and a trial in the senate, both of which are R controlled. If he wants any success, he has to have a rock solid case far beyond any reasonable or even unreasonable doubt to convince 30 Rs to vote against there own party. The only way around this is if Ds take back the House this fall, which will require him waiting until next year. '

Its already a matter of public record that the origins of the investigation were grounded in legitimate concerns; but yes- anyone abusing their position should be punished.\nNow..if I may ask you a question. If a former Marine, purple heart recipient, lifelong public servant, former FBI director with strong bipartisan recognition as a man of integrity and fealty to the law finds that Trump knowingly and willingly broke multiple laws- several against the interests of the United States - would you accept it and, in defense and loyalty to your country - would you want to see him punished on accordance with the law?

'#TEXTBOOK CONCERN TROLLING\n\n" One common tactic of concern trolls is the "a plague on both your houses" approach, where the concern troll tries to convince people that both sides of the ideological divide [are just as bad as each other](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Balance_fallacy), and so no one can think themselves "correct" but must engage in endless hedging and caveats. This preys on a willingness to debate critics and allow dissent; everyone wastes time discussing the matter and bending over backwards, so as *not* to appear intolerant of disagreement, all to the great amusement of the troll.

"[Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's son loaned President Donald Trump over a billion dollars for his real estate projects, The New York Times reported.](http://www.businessinsider.com/anthony-kennedy-son-loaned-president-trump-over-a-billion-dollars-2018-6?utm_source=reddit.com) "
"I'm pretty sure he only cares about himself getting off. "
'First time in history that a former Supreme Court justice accepts a Presidential pardon? We’ll see. '
'> if Kennedy son has a lent a ton of money to trump wouldn’t that mean, trump is under his control not that he is under trump control\n\nThat would be true if that’s all there was to the case, but it isn’t. First off, the debt is owed to Deutsche Bank, not Kennedy’s son directly, so he has no leverage over the President now that the loan has gone through. Second... it’s obvious from Trump’s credit history that no sane or reasonable person should be lending him change for a cab, much less a billion fucking dollars. On top of that, it’s all but certain now that he’s been laundering money for the Russian mob, and possibly other criminal organizations, for decades. So the fact that he got a massive loan from Deutsche Bank thanks to Kennedy’s son means that either a) he’s someone Kennedy’s son likes enough to make a billion-dollar gamble on despite being a walking red flag, in which case he’s way too close to the family for Kennedy to be voting on cases concerning him, or b) the Kennedys, and possibly other higher-ups at Deutsche Bank, are compromised by the mob, the KGB, or someone else who has a strong (and almost certainly illegal) interest in Trump continuing to get loans and do business. \n\nI’m not normally a conspiracy-minded person... but I do find myself wondering if Kennedy was already compromised in 2010 when he opened the floodgates for untraceable spending on political campaigns with Citizens United. After all, he’s supposed to be reasonable, and yet he cast the deciding vote for a ruling that killed the last barrier to corporations and anonymous mega-donors outright buying elections...'
'You’re not appreciating how powerful it is to pick a Supreme Court Justice. \n\nThat is a gift that keeps on giving for decades, like maybe a few years from now when you aren’t President anymore and are suddenly defending yourself from a billion Federal and Sate level lawsuits and criminal charges.

"This is consistent with data, which shows that Republican support for a policy depends on who's enacting it, not what it is.

"This's why i don't get those people who claimed shit that realistic are pessimistic stories where everyone acting like crappy human beings and dismissed heroism as sentimental crap that don't have place in cruel world or will only get shot down by the morally ambiguous. There are legitimate heroes like Audie Murphy and Mueller himself who looked so heroic there's a chance you wouldn't believe their stories if they're fictional characters, not to mention they're awarded quiet heftily too.\n\nVery heroic characters have place with very flawed and shady heroes in realistic stories, as long as they're shown to be not invulnerable, or even showing others who have valor like them but don't get their respect or awards."
'I may lean right politically but Tammy Duckworth is a Grade A Badass. Love her. '
'General Marine Corps culture.

Also sometimes used when generally giving a briefing, as seen with Sec. Mattis.'
'Thanks again for helping a bold faced traitor to our country get pretty much every single crooked, double dealing, piece of human excrement nominee in that he asked for Sen McCain. '
'wrong politics for most but McCain is a true patriot making the best of working for his party boss and shitty coworkers. '
"That's the thing - partisanship is so high that if Trump wins the republican nomination in 2020, McCain will still endorse. "
"Well done Trump, anything to twist NoName's knickers, is a good thing."
'Wow this place is going to be fun once you guys realize who/what Mueller is investigating. '
"Allegations are laid out, plain as day. The evidence to support them unfortunately isn't. The simple fact is that much of the actual evidence is tied up due to the nature of the ongoing investigatory process. Much has been speculated and suggested, few things have been substantiated or supported with evidence. A prime example of this is the Manafort case. The more you learn about the Manfort case, the more I think you will agree with me. \n\nI would agree that this isn't a matter of left vs right. Corruption has no party or national allegiance. You allege with such veracity that you must be absolutely certain, and yet Mueller's special counsel investigation has spent many more millions of dollars than you to reach a conclusion that disagrees with yours. As I've said, there is certainly still time and opportunity for me to be wrong, but in this particular context it seems strange that nothing actionable has resulted from Mueller's investigation in regards to Trump supposedly being controlled by a hostile nation. I know it's an easy trap to fall into, but it just doesn't make sense why something of that much importance wouldn't be the first thing flushed out by Mueller's investigation. \n\n\n> Mueller isn’t a “anti-Trump hero”. He’s a lawman doing his job to protect the US from threats.\n\n100%\n\n"
'Great username, rofl'
'Lmao remember when his supporters said he’d been the next Reagan '
'Good article, thanks. \n\nThis story seems very credible. Rykov actually posted about Cambridge Analytica a year before that story broke, so his claims have some merit. So many Russians. \n\nI\'m googling Konstantin Rykov now and found this old article. [in Trump We Trust - Reuters](https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1541S6). No news, just interesting to see how hard the Russians were celebrating Trump\'s inauguration. Couple tidbits:\n\n>Sellers of traditional matryoshka nesting dolls have added Trump dolls to their popular line-up of items carved in the likeness of President Vladimir Putin, Bolshevik revolutionary Vladimir Lenin, ex-President Mikhail Gorbachev and Josef Stalin.\n\n>They are holding an all-night party at what used to be the main Soviet-era post office in Moscow where they will showcase their favorite prop, a triptych of Putin, Trump and French Front National leader Marine Le Pen.\n\n>Konstantin Rykov, a former pro-Putin lawmaker and one of the event\'s promoters, said on social media it was right to celebrate the first phase of the "New World Order." "Washington will be ours," he quipped.\n\nWow. '
'Interesting, but be leary of Kremlin connected info.\n\n\nIf I were them, and I wanted to help protect my investment in Trump, strategy number one would be engineered leaks of damning information, that can be easily reversed and debunked later.\n\n\nDo that enough, and nobody believes anything.'
'This is amazing! Where is it from?'
'The good guys who voted in Trump?  The good guys who supported Bernie?  The good guys who supported Clinton?  \n\nIMO, the good guys are being shit on and stiffled by the Political Machine that is the Democrats and Republicans.\n\nSo unless alternative parties with uncorrupt leaders emerge, then no, the good guys will NOT win.'
"You are nothing. You're a keyboard warrior in your parents' basement. You have no influence over the decisions of this administration. Trump is trying to take away your health insurance and cut your parents' retirement, the EPA is slashing regulations keeping the air you breathe and the water you drink safe, and Congress is trying to pass tax cuts for the wealthy that won't benefit you in any form, but please, keep pretending you're making America great again from behind your screen."
"**The Base Left** for the win **SON!** Get ready for a **multicultural, paradise of diversity!**\n\n\nRemember this Trump supporters. \n\nThe people you're trying to step on, we're everyone you depend on. We're the people who do your laundry and cook your food and serve your dinner. We make your bed. We guard you while you sleep. We drive the ambulances. We direct your call.

'Sure,  but basically, they need 60 votes, which means all the Republicans and 9 Democrats (or more Democrats if they don\'t get all the Republicans).\n\nThis means they have to offer the Democrats *something*. They only need the nine most conservative Democrats... the senators from say Alabama, West Virginia, North Dakota, Missour, and a few more... but they have to offer *something", maybe not a lot, but something. At this point they don\'t seem to be doing so.\n\nThat\'s is an effect of the supermajority requirement. This requirement works the same when the parties are reversed and is supported and maintained by both parties, so it\'s not a partisan thing.\n\nTrump, to his credit, seemed quite open to some sort of compromise. But he seems to have to changed his mind, and the Republican party is not at this time offering any reasonable comprise.\n\nJust to be frank and honest and not intended as an attack, but as a practical matter, it\'s not clear at this point what Trump wants, what he believes, or if he really understands the subject very well. If he does, he needs to communicate this much better. Absent that, negotiations are quite difficult.'
'Downvoted by your own kind for using logic and speaking the truth. '
'They offered the democrats everything. Obstruction is the name of the game. The republicans did this with Obama. I vote for firing all of them. Or making them work until they have made progress both sides. I feel like our government as a whole is a joke at this point'
"Not really a murder. A bit of a roasting, but not a murder.\n\nEdit: Do y'all even go to that sub? That really isn't a murder. It is definitely a burn, maybe even a roast. But that is not murder."
'What "everything" did they offer? They didn\'t offer a DACA solution (i mean Trump offered it but it was then withdrawn). They did offer CHIP funding, but that\'s not really anything, considering that both parties agree that CHIP is a good thing. That\'s kind of like "Well, as a concession to you Democrats, if you agree to this bill, we won\'t give Washington State to Canada, as a concession on our part, OK?"'
">They offered the democrats everything. Obstruction is the name of the game. The republicans did this with Obama\n\nActually the Republicans didn't offer Obama anything. McConnell swore that Obama would not be able to accomplish anything, and all of the executive orders Obama issued so he could accomplish something. All the do-nothing Republican congresses did was vote to repeal the ACA over 60 times."
'they consistently vote to keep the powerful powerful and to keep the rich rich. This isnt due to any set of principles or ideals, but simply because they are the rich and powerful due to the way the government operates'
'Their overlords (not the people who keep on voting for them) direct them as they see fit. And they are happy to lockstep with their masters.'
'I don\'t, actually. I just explained above. I\'ll try to explain it more simply. Both of these "concessions" are basically identical:\n\n* "As a concession to you Democrats, we will extend CHIP for six years".\n\n* "As a concession to you Democrats, we will not give Washington State to Canada, at least not in the next six years."\n\nSee what I\'m saying? Neither of these are "concessions" since both sides agree on whether they\'re a good thing. The Republican Party likes CHIP, thinks CHIP is a good thing, and intends to extend CHIP. So how is it a "concession" to support CHIP? It\'s just nonsense to say that it is.\n\nWho is the "they" that doesn\'t have a DACA solution? DACA was fine: Delayed Action for Childhood Arrivals. It worked fine under Obama. That\'s the solution the Democrats have on offer: keep doing that.\n\nI get that the Republican Party doesn\'t *want* to continue DACA. So what? You need sixty votes. You have to do *something* you don\'t want in order to get the Wall funding and so forth that you do want, and get a budget passed.\n\nUpdate, looks like the Republicans were successful in getting the Americans to blame the Democrats more for the shutdown, so the Democrats caved. That\'s politics, and doesn\'t prove that the Democrats really *were* responsible. We\'re going to have to revisit this shortly, though... so we\'ll see.'
'I don’t think it is, but they sure do love forcing children to drink lead water.'
"Lip service is exactly what it is.\n\nThey don't give a damn about you. They don't give a damn about coal miners. Refinery workers. Mothers. Workplace safety. Water quality. Such a bloody long list.\n\nThey don't care about this *country.*\n\nAll they care about is landing the next reelection and ensuring that their supported businesses remain profitable. *Fuck everything else.*"
"I am not a Republican, I don't care what they did during the Obama presidency, and I voted for him. You must not live in a state affected by illegals, or you must not know anybody who has immigrated here legally and has been negatively affected by the illegals. They are practically treated like slaves over here in good ole California.\n\nYou just assume I'm a white christian too lol, and you just assume DACA is 'incredibly popular' despite Obama deferring it to the next president. I'm with Trump and the republicans on this one though, No wall, no DACA. We need to control our borders once and for all."
"I sure did, but the fact you just **know** I didn't tells me just about everything I need to know about you. You lack wisdom. I will not reply to you anymore because if I am to try to debate people on here with a 10 minute rate limit, I might as well not try to debate people that think they know everything. "
"this was nothing more than them trying to keep trumps demographic. they know they are going to have to impeach him, so they are doing as much as possible to make it look like they are 100 percent behind him before they impeach him and hope to god they don't go down the shitter as well for this russia stuff."
'My working theory: Trump has been told he is now a target.\n\nThe ironically named "Freedom Caucus" chose to display to Trump what good puppets they are for him.'
"> His personal finances are about to be revealed. \n\nThat sounds great. Do you have a source for this or reason you think it's the case?"
"They need to win the primary first. Get on the wrong side of trump and they'll be up against a pro trump primary challenger. It's not about the district flipping yet, it's about getting to contest the election. Already happened to one incumbent who was mildly critical of trump but had a perfect voting record. "
'Cool, so the dude likes to keep his old phones... is this the part where I go “OH MUH GURD RUSSIAN COLLUSION CONFIRMED!!!”'
'Plot twist, he is really just a lover of Nokia phones and is unwilling to have his high scores in Snake wiped when a new phone comes out.'
'I like my phones like I like my women.  \n\n&nbsp;16. - Cohen/Trump probably'
"Probably too late for this but I think this is important:\n\nAs important as this is to the investigation we need to divorce the idea that this raid was done in place of a sit down meeting.\n\nThis raid was done because there was evidence that Michael Cohen committed a crime uncovered through the investigation.\n\nIf Michael Cohen was just a lawyer operating legally and representing DJT's interests through the full extent of the law, this WOULD have been a sit down conversation.\n\nTrump supporters will continue to spam a misunderstanding of attorney-client privilege and we need to actively guard against this argument."
'This is what we knew all along...  Why does this surprise anyone??     GOP is party first.'
'Just checking in to laugh.  Been over a year and millions of dollars spent and Trump is still winning!!!'
'More like House-Of-No Intelligence Committee'
'The GOP doesn’t care for the people.\n\nThey announced this for two reasons:\n\nAn attempt to discredit Mueller\n\nThe special elections in Pennsylvania were the very next day, so they wanted to bolster their base'
"You do realize Devin Nunes has been trying to undermine the FBI for the past year. He doesn't decide if there was or was not collusion and obstruction of justice. This was the whole point of the special prosecutor. Luckily we have facts on our side, and Mueller has the say in this. Not Nunes."
'Здравствуйте друзья! I am John Smith from the Colorado, am typical American citizen. I assure, this all coincidence and is nothing to see here my friends.

'Here\'s the original video of Trump saying "Russia if you\'re listening" -- along with followup questions from reporters -- it\'s 100% clear Trump wasn\'t joking:\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/video/watch-trump-call-on-russia-to-find-clinton-s-emails-tell-reporter-to-be-quiet-733375555707\n\nOne of the most interesting details of the Cohen development -- other than TRUMP FUCKING KNEW (which really has been obvious all along) -- is that this leak appears to NOT have come from Cohen or his team.\n\nIf it came from Trump\'s team, he must be pretty damn desperate.'
'>"I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week, and we\'re going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons," Trump said during a speech after winning the California, Montana, New Mexico, South Dakota and New Jersey primaries. "I think you\'re going to find it very informative and very, very interesting. I wonder if the press will want to attend. Who knows?" \n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2017/07/11/politics/trump-campaign-june-9/index.html\n\nThe speech, of course, never took place. And it\'s extremely clear that Trump said the above expecting to get dirt from the Trump Tower meeting, and then never gave the speech because the Russians didn\'t give him any dirt on Hillary.'

'So popularity = the truth or right thing. That is fucking hilarious. '
"How the fuck are people still trusting anything on cable?  Fox is nazi-level propaganda, but MSBCs trying to match it and even the centrist networks are 90% entertainment.

"> Fifty-nine percent of respondents said they believe Mueller is conducting a fair investigation, while 26 percent said it was not fair.\n\nAll that this survey proves is that that 15% of the people taking the survey were smart enough to admit that they don't know enough about the subject to comment on it. "
"The rule of law would require the president to make some time available as nobody is above the law in a democracy. This isn't the Cuban missile crisis, Trump isn't in the situation room 20 hours per day. Presidents make time for photo ops, speeches to boy scouts, presentation of awards and honours, and golf - these are all much lower priorities than an investigation of this nature. The Russian election meddling is the greatest attack on the mainland by a state actor since WW2, the investigation must proceed and an innocent president should want to ensure its success."
"We don't have the facts on Trump's involvement but with four people indicted so far the question of collusion will go before the courts in accordance with principles of natural justice. If others are indicted in future, same deal. That's how criminality is determined in a justice system based on the rule of law and it should not be impeded."
'This reminded me of old Colbert. This was pretty funny'
"Colbert is the man. He was brutally honest toward Hillary too, and he is a Bernie Bro (even though his corporate CBS sponsors restrained him from being too vocal about it). I've been a fan of his since his appearances on the Dana Carvey Show and Strangers With Candy. Thank God for his comic relief in these Dark Ages of American history."
'Hahaha I loved it! I haven’t laughed this good since [REDACTED].'
'From the book America According to Colbert - Satire as Public Pedagogy (by S. McClennan)\n\nColbert: Peter Cook was once asked if he thought that satire had a political effect.  He said, “Absolutely. The greatest satire of the twentieth century was the Weimar Cabaret, and they stopped Hitler in his tracks!” It doesn’t mean what we do is worthless. It’s hard to do, and people like it, and it’s great. But it doesn’t mean that it has an effect politically.\n\nStewart: Or that it has an agenda of social change. We are not warriors in anyone’s army.... I don’t view us as people who lead social movements. '
'Well, he seems to be snapping back into character for these interviews which is great and gives you a little slice of nostalgia. '
"My friend is a staffer on the hill. She moved to DC to answer the phone at her congressman's office and it is a thankless job for an unpaid intern. She pours her soul into trying to explain things to constituents and understand their concerns and several calls have left her in tears. \n\nWhen Colbert filmed this a couple of weeks ago he spent the whole day there goofing off and cracking everyone up. He took extra time to talk with staffers and let them get pictures, thanking each of them for their work. She said that day alone made the whole internship worthwhile.\n\nHe is genuinely a nice guy who cares about his country. "
"I feel like the streaming didn't hit the the comedy punch it deserved"
'You don’t watch the Opposition with Jordan Klepper? When John left I thought Jordan would have been a perfect fit as the host of the DS. But it turns how he found an even better niche basically on an evolved version of the Colbert Report. He and his staff do a lot of these off-the-wall interviews. '
'Never saw it but now excited to watch it.  Thank you kind stranger.'
"It does but it doesn't mean we can't opine for the good old days.  I'm honestly surprised by how much downvotes my post got simply saying I miss 2 shows."
'I have and do watch the shows. I like them all.  I enjoy new takes on things and appreciate what each has to offer. \n\nColbert is alway silly. That never changed.  Him and John Oliver uncomfortably close in a box was hysterical!  \n\nI like Trevor Noah. Seeing a "new" American take on our culture gives me new insight. \n\nI just don\'t see it the way you do,  I guess.'
'Essentially: The Daily Show was better with Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert was better on the Colbert Report.'

'Russian collusion is the ultimate conspiracy theory. Pushed by criminals in an attempt to cover their crimes, and overthrow lawful government.\n\nDo you have one shred of evidence ?\n\nWhat about the meeting with the Russian lawyer given special clearance by Loretta Lynch to enter the country to meet with Don jr. ? Did she lie about having the goods on HRC ? Yes. Did she meet with Fusion GPS henchman Glenn Simpson both before and after the meeting ? Yes. Was it an attempt to "set up" Trump ? Yes. Why do you need to try and set people up ? **Because they aren\'t guilty**. Did they illegally spy on the campaign and President of the United States ? Yes.\n\nThere is hard, cold, irrefutable and verifiable evidence to support all this. The real truth is coming out, and you are mad about it. What kind of person does that make you ? What kind of citizen does that make you ? You are the deplorable, running around shout false allegations at others. Pathetic.'
'Well Trump\'s two most recent quotes are:\n\n"I believe Robert Mueller will treat me fairly" (and he will)\n\nAnd\n\n"There was no collusion, but even if there was collusion it\'s not a crime (hahaha yeah, it is), but there was no collusion"(hahah...

'Good thing groups like the NRA don’t have to report donor information to the IRS anymore. The GOP needs all the foreign money it can get. '
'When all is said and done, I believe the republican Party will return to some sense of honesty and relevancy. In the years since the days of *Citizens United* ruling which essentially gave carte blanc to special interests to corrupt politicians in a legal way, no party has taken advantage of its dark underbelly parts as much as the GOP and its supporters., it\'s fruitful gift it was given is now beginning to rot and fester as we see how true masters of corruption, the people behind Putin, Oligarchs and Russian intelligence, can use these tools to really reek havoc on American politics.\n\nThe Republican party clings to Trump like a symbiotic host at the least and at the worst, antagonistic or parasitic. Trump has used what parts of the GOP he wants and discards the rest. \n\nIts clear that the GOP has become co-dependent on Trump, a love and abuse relationship that the GOP cannot seem to handle or have not a clue on how to end it. They sold their base to Trump & Co. when they allowed the White Supremacists and rabid "no-nothing" anti-immigrant "deplorable" to take over. They gave Donald Trump the loudest "dog-whistle" and taught him how to use it.\n\nThe GOP needs help and if has to be tough love. But between the , the Freedom Caucus, Tea Partyers and other groups sworn to fringe beliefs and politics, they will, in killing a parasite like Trump, have to take a little poison, and may kill of the Donald, but also the fringe politics that have brought some fringe voters out with their needed support of a GOP that is getting old and tired.'

'Here in Arizona, while the GOP has shrunk, or had a very low or negative growth rate, the Independents have grown and are now the largest segment of the voters, as all three are around 32-33%, so its pretty equal. While the independents are not republican, they are social and fiscal conservatives and tend to vote that way. They can be swayed though, but only with much re-assurance and hand holding. Do not be fooled by Trumps recent rallies here, he is not real welcome and only the most conservative Republican bastions of North and SE Phoenix support him (and Sheriff Joe) The people are not happy here as you can tell by both Jeff Flake and Sen McCain, who most hold here, either Republican, Independents and even some Democrats, with a bit of reverence,or at least respect\n\nI think the Dems here will gain some seats (1-3) in the House, but if they win a seat in the Senate, the republican party here will drop its support of trumpettts like a hot tamale cooking on the streets of Phoenix mid-day. The Independents will decide this election.'

"A brief case against this subreddit, intended with the greatest of respect to all parties involved:\n\nBob Muller is an honorable man whose job is to seek the truth of the matter concerning our President.  He was chosen because he would be seen as competent figure with broad, bipartisan support. Initially, he was clearly seen as such.  This is important, as to maintain some semblance of unity going forward from whatever discoveries he may make, he needs to be trusted by all sides.  Various parties have been trying to undermine this by painting the situation as Trump vs. Muller. While I do not think this subreddit was created with the intention of pushing this narrative, I'm afraid that it does play into it.  Muller should be viewed first and foremost as someone seeking the truth.  If he is viewed as Trump's rival by the general public, Trump can try to paint the investigation as unfair, a witch hunt, etcetera, and some portion of the public will eat it up.  Because this subreddit would play into a narrative that would delegitimization Mueller's investigation, I cannot support it."
'Let\'s see... \n\nSince this is a parody of the The_Donald [but  nonetheless on the side of the good guys], we need some title for Mueller, and of course we need to one-up the Trump supporters as parody of them... \n\nSo if Trump is "God-Emperor" to the Trump supporters, what should Mueller be?

Keep in mind all three dumped him after coming to the conclusion he had Trump's priorites in mind above theirs.\n"

Then when Trump found out about the abortion, he cried in despair, because he believes every life is sacred.  And of course, it’s all Hillary’s fault.  Lock her up, lock her up.  '

"542 million users\n\n234 unique users per month\n\n#4 most visited site, USA\n\n#8 most visited site in the world\n\nTheoretical TCP max packet size, 64K\n\nAverage percentage of malicious traffic 25%\n\nBased upon this data, and some of it is there as a general use pattern, we see what traffict Reddit could receive. This rough guide uses 64k to cover various data sizes and types as inbound traffic. That gives us 15 Terabytes of TCP traffic per month, on a very conservative average. We then have all the annoying script kiddies, botnets, angry governments, etc., that send malicious packets. That increases the monthly traffic by about 3.75 Terabytes per month. \n\nNow those packets have to talk with DNS, firewalls, load balancers, servers, object storage, backend adminstration services, and back to the users. That requires a significant amount of infrastructure to support all that traffic. This infrastructure includes several routers, switches and other network gear.\n\nWe have an average visitation time of 13 minutes and 8 billion page visits per month. That brings up our monthly package transmissions significantly. I'd SWAG the monthly inbound packets to be over 50 Terabytes and outbound to be close.\n\nWhere do we store all of that data? There will be databases, object storage and general filesystems storing that data. That's a lot of data! This accumulation is impressive, most companies love to retain data for data mining, think data scientists. There's also log data to use for trouble shooting and seeking out those malicious folks.\n\nReddit, yet another super SWAG, probably stores 250 Terabytes per month.\n\nThey also have developers, administrative staff, etc. that are required to run the business. \n\nAs I have worked with global scale organizations with millions of users,, even very lean ones such as Reddit, the monthly overheard for technologies are most likely over $750,000.00 per month. There's a solid chance of it being higher. The costs for the employees are probably over $2,500,000.00 per month, based upon some posts on Glassdoor.\n\nThis is a rough estimate of costs. Reddit has some ads revenue, but no where near Facebook or Google. Reddit gold does help pay the bills. It's highly doubtful they are making tons of money from such a small and unique feature. \n\nThe challenge Reddit has is monetization of their product without becoming an ad smeared service like Facebook. It's quite a challenge really, to make money while offering a service that is free to its customer's.\n\n\n"

'The Republican Party won\'t do anything because it considers party, power, and control exponentially more important than democratic institutions, alliances, or citizens. With such a display of insanity being bombarded at us daily, by every side of the media, certain elements of the GOP are able to undercut any attempts at change and continue to push their agenda quietly through legislative channels. While the media and elements within their own party increasingly cast doubts on this presidency and the actions it takes, supporters broadcast their own narrative to bolster their base and rely on constant and increasingly insane media coverage to distract their opposition from pressing issues.\n\nFor example, on "liberal" issues:\n\nRemember Bump Stocks? Non issue. The media moved on to another crazy political story.\n\nRemember school shootings? Something else happened and moved the discussion.\n\nNet Neutrality? In the past now and largely forgotten.\n\nSinclair going Goebbels? Nope. One time coverage before a new shit show distracted everyone.\n\nFlorida gerrymandering and secret GOP map redistricting efforts? Forgotten.\n\nTaxes? Infrastructure? Military Spending? CBP or NPR being defunded? The dismantling of AmeriCorps? Supreme Court Cases? All the "distant past."\n\nMeanwhile:\n\nFox News - Cover Story as of 0948 EST is Rand Paul saying it\'s ok to Reach out to Russia.\n\nWell, that seems reasonable. America has often reached out to former enemies. This changes the narrative and distracts the GOP base from the larger issue-the President of the United States pretty much shaming and insulting the entire US intelligence community. Under normal circumstances, it\'s perfectly acceptable to offer an olive branch. These are not normal circumstances, but the title and article aim to distract and change the narrative to prevent faith in the President from being lost. It\'s subtle, brilliant, and effective.\n\nWe\'re being willingly lead over the abyss while watching what is, essentially, a circus unfold before our very eyes. It\'s easy to be distracted by an idiot, which is exactly what certain members of the GOP want. 2018 midterms will determine the outcome of this country\'s slide into one party control and oligarchy.'

'The 19.5% was bought by Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), Glencore, and QHG Cayman LTD, all incorporated in a consortium called QHG Holdings, LLC, formed a few days before the sale. The random inclusion of a Cayman Islands company has raised flags from the get go. The .5% brokerage fee theory is just that - a theory. An Italian bank and other financial orgs lent billions to QHG for the purchase price. QIA only offered up about $2 billion for the $10 billion stake. Glencore offered far less than that. The Italian bank offered a $5.2 billion loan, meaning QIA and Glencore didn’t really expend much capital in the purchase. However, all the parties to the purchase - including the Cayman Islands company - still reaped the benefits when they sold the stake to China last year. The $282 million *might* be all that transferred hands to Trump/associates, and the theory that is was tacked on as a brokerage fee could be right. But that’s not necessarily fact yet either. '

"Lol. The idea that the House Intel Committee isn't just a bunch of partisan hacks trying to politicize intelligence....the exact opposite thing their committee is supposed to do...is laughable at best. Devin Nunes has consistently proven this."

'Trump made me, a die-hard Steelers fan, start liking the Eagles. I just bought an Eagles hat to show some solidarity.'
'Another example of spoiled rich professional athletes refusing to show patriotism!  Show as a team to show "unity" or stay home.  Glad the President choose to honor real men and heros.  However, I wish the Predsident didn\'t cancel so we could recognize the Eagles players that refuse to be so petty.  '

'YES. YES. YES. THANK GOD THIS GREASY FUCK IS NOT GETTING AWAY.\n\nEdit: I just read that this lone tweet is all we have. Hopefully this is corroborated soon. I do think Nunes is dirty and his time will come even if this was just a rumor.'
"I doubt that its a criminal investigation, however the Special Prosecutor can send a confidential letter to the ethics committee on subjects such as the unauthorized release of confidential or classified documents to those not cleared to receive them.\n\nA formal criminal investigation would most likely cause our dumb-ass President to declassify the docs to save Nunez' ass, but would end in making these document available to Russia or any country that may see the benefit on how the US intelligence agencies gather information. Sometimes documents are classified not becasue of the subject, but how the information was procured and who found it and delivered it to the US."
'I remember someone in a comment about Nunes brought up how he has some "friend of Portugal" award and how he might have somehow given info to Russia regarding USA east coast submarine routes through Portuguese contacts. There has been an uptick of Russia submarine presence in the Atlantic. I forget the details linking everything together. I don\'t remember what they said specifically and I don\'t have enough time to reasearch it and link it all nicely\n\n But I found this... Nunes is shady as shit. At the very least he risks national security so a military base can be built at his favorite vacation spot (a Portuguese island)\n\nhttps://www.thedailybeast.com/nunes-wins-sorta-spy-center-now-on-hold\n\n\nMore info.. from 2015.

"There was a best of reddit yesterday about this very thing.  The person had a pretty substantial argument he's being blackmailed by the Russians and it's all connected to a military base and Portugal which he has been over the top supporter of for years.  It was a very interesting theory take a look.  \n\n\nEdit:  here ya go. \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7jmngr/trump_dossier_firm_republicans_leaked_bank/dr83rxc/\n"
'“Donnie Moscow”. I’m gonna borrow that!  Awesome. '
"I was wondering whether it had anything to do with his time on the transition team.  As in, he knows of illicit activities with the Russkies, maybe even partook in some of them, so he's complicit.  He was probably trying to angle is way into a cozy administration position, but ultimately they decided he'd be more useful as a congressional stooge."
'Funny how all the leaks (which pretty much backfire) are all coming from the Trump side.   \n\nMueller is running a tight ship.'
"That's pretty incredible, if true.  But seems rather far-fetched.  Why would he be willing to commit treason just to re-establish a military base on a tiny island in the Atlantic?  I get that his heritage is in the Azores, but he was born and raised in the U.S.  Surely there are more ethical ways of improving the economy of the Azores that don't involve sharing classified intel with Russia?"
'>I am convinced that his role in this entire saga is tied to the boner that he has for Lajes Field in the Azores.\n\nOne of the things I love about Reddit is people will post the most erudite, carefully sourced and crafted information on here, but put it in totally commonplace language. "Tied to the boner he has for Lajes Field" would never get into the New York Times, but it\'s pithy AF.\n\nNever change, people. You give me intellectual wood.'
"Publicly, there's nothing concrete (as far as I know). Nunes was in the transition, so should have been recused from investigating it. His public behavior suggests he's using his authority and position to obstruct an investigation. His determination suggests more than regular loyalty, but more like somebody has something on him."

K Street Lobbyists are terrified and Fox News and the right wing are screaming in agony and rage.  Mueller's doing a very good job of making my dreams come true.  He's not going to drop the bomb until it's airtight and damming and all possible legal loopholes have been eliminated as well as all doors of escape to everyone involved in this conspiracy closed.  He protected himself with the transition emails and subpoenaed Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo which means it's close.  Sometimes you have to wait for a masterpiece.  I'll take that over a rushed job where there are avenues of legal defense.  Mueller is not playing with these fuckers."

I don\'t think they could be more clumsy or transparent in their actions or excuses.  Short of saying "It\'s all true and I\'m Donald Trump", they broadcast their shitty games pretty consistently.\n\nThe part that saddens me is that they didn\'t feel a need to be better at it.  How long has this been going on?  What else do we need to be concerned about?  The actions are inexplicable.'

'I see trump becoming part of an unsealed indictment by late March. My reasoning: \n\nhttps://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/02/trump-russia-indictment-mueller-probe-384969 So basically lawyers who have dealt with muellers team think that based upon, I assume, line of questioning that trump is guilty as fuck and they have proof. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/thehill.com/homenews/media/374178-abcs-stephanopoulos-to-interview-comey-in-april%3famp (correct me if I am wrong but I believe I read somewhere that nothing is off the table for that interview in regards to what George is allowed to ask) While I realize that it is simply an interview about his book he does seem to also be advertising the interview and his public statements about trump/Hillary/everything he knew as FBI director leading up to the election. To me I feel like he would not be allowed to talk openly about much of this for legal reasons/ out of respect for letting the special counsel simply do their job. That being said he may simply say "I cannot answer that at this point in time" which I truly hope is not the case. \n\nI mean we are months behind knowing what the special counsel has been doing for most things we find out about. And the stuff we are getting now is so absolutely juicy and delicious I could see trump being named within a month and a half \n\nEdit: Mueller is just crossing his Ts and dotting his Is :)'
"Yeah, I agree.  Honestly, I don't think he'd even be allowed to release the book if Mueller didn't have his ducks all lined up.  \n\nAnd I see Trump being indicted by the end of March too.  And I've been saying that since the very first indictments of Manafort and Gates.  My reasoning comes from managing a  whole lot of complex litigation during the 1980s& 1990s, where I came to love the RICO act and the art of legally lasso-ing criminals as if they were rodeo calves.  I think I've got some sort of sense of the rate and rhythm at which these things proceed.\n\nBasically I started with the number of attorneys working under Mueller, and factored in their incredible expertise,  intelligence and intense professionalism.  Then I added into that Mueller's own abilities.  Then what they must have on Manafort and Gates to get to the stage of a GJ indictment, and then from there I walked my way, indictment by indictment to Trump.  And it was around the end of March.  And that's before I even factored in George Papadopoulos.\n\nNext up, imo?  Brad Parscale.  And pretty soon, Peter Pansky aka Kushner.  But not quite yet.  \n\nBuckle up kids!  March is going to be some kind of wild ride."
"Thank you for brightening my night and reminding me of that. I'm just happy they can't go to US-friendly countries any more. "
"True. What I meant to get at is that if someone has been appointed as the director of the FBI, they are probably trustworthy, and are certainly far more likely to be trustworthy and objective than your average American. That won't always necessarily be the case though, as you said. I just think it's highly likely. "

"Mueller's A Great American "
'At least Trubbish has a cute, goofy design. Trump is just... well, Trump.'
'So, basically, the Supreme Court might adopt the position that instead of a President the USA has a King? (Or Queen, although that seems unlikely in light of the last election).'
'Ok, so you can’t charge a sitting president. For the sake of argument, I’ll go along with it. After all, they can just pardon themselves to get out of it. Therefore, they’d need to be impeached first. What must happen for an impeachment? Well. There have to be crimes, which then need to be investigated. Or should even the act of investigating be held off on til after they’ve left office, where evidence is missing, gone or cold, memories are foggy, and even statutes of limitations have run their course?\n\nIs this guy actually saying that investigations of sitting presidents shouldn’t take place? \n\nWouldn’t John Gotti have loved it if he had gotten to choose his entire jury and which judge should preside over his case?\n\nIf anything, because of the extreme amount of trust and power given to the office, anyone occupying it should be held more accountable to the law than the average citizen, not less. '
'He says he believes that impeachment is a solution for removing a President from office, not indictment or prosecution, but he also believes that the President should be immune from investigation. If the President cannot even be investigated, how can we come to point where we are sure that he/she should be impeached? It seems like a contradiction.'
'Provide the source, this looks like it’s from a law review journal. \n\nGive us the source, and everyone should send this excerpt to their senate representatives and say you want them to push for this question to be asked at the confirmation hearing. We want to know for a fact, under oath, that he doesn’t hold this belief or will not act on it, or that he will, either way. \n\nThis is legal strategy, because if he says no, and pushes for this idea later, he would’ve effectively lied in his confirmation hearing, and if he says yes, this is a piece Mueller can use as circumstantial evidence for Trumps obstruction of justice charge. '
"Okay, I'm more interested who found Kavanaugh to be nominated. It's not like Trump would go through all potential Supreme Court candidates to weed out this piece of info.\n\nAnd what a coincidence that Kennedy is retiring for this guys name to come up so fast."
'I do find it amusing that he wrote that essentially defending Clinton. Saying that investigation distracted him from running the country. \n\nAnd some are taking it as him being a trump supporter/defender.  That’s not really the case at all. \n\nClinton’s investigation was essentially completely irrelevant to him being president or his job as president until he lied under oath.   Trump on the other hand, potentially working with a foreign country to win an election and perhaps still working with them is a completely different sort of issue that directly effects his ability as president. \n\nI don’t see anyway Kavanaugh would suggest stopping the mueller probe at this point. As trump is still not even labeled as a/the subject of the probe. \n\nI mean I understand people are going to flip out because trump nominated Kavanaugh. But tbh kavanuagh is a moderate, he’s in all likelihood the best possible nomination we would get from trump. '
'I hope he thinks that way.  We need someone with the countrys best interest in mind.  We don\'t need a "stacked court" that trump\'s case might be decided by.\n'
'You mean he did his job to the best of his abilities when working on the Starr report? Oh the horror. We should much prefer a person who half asses his job. Your argument here is the equivalent of you wanting Mueller to not do his job if Trump was a Democrat.  I on the other hand want all investigations handled as thoroughly and professionally as possible.  And I agree with Kavanaugh that if the investigation is largely irrelevant into how the president is actually governing the country, that the investigation should take place after his presidency. \n\nHe specifically mentions Clinton in his article and how the investigation into Clinton distracted Clinton from being able to run the country.  How you see that but anything as supportive of Clinton I do not know. \n\n\n\n'
"That is the traditional understanding of executive immunity. A special prosecutor would typically refer his findings to Congress and recommend impeachment. Mueller indicting Trump would be *Mueller* breaking the norm.\n\nOf course, I don't think the drafters of the Constitution envisioned a complicit Congress that would never impeach, which takes the bite away from impeachment, to say the least."
"Doing his job is not equivalent to pursuing an aggressive approach in an investigation. Those who use less aggressive methods on reasonable grounds may just as well be fulfilling their role. Kavanaugh's problem is that his own words can be utilized to criticize his actions, and it is difficult to say he was completely free from political bias while forming that opinion.\n\nIf the American Supreme Court rulings weren't so partisan themselves, what you said would be reasonable: both parties should not use Supreme Court nominees for their political gain. Unfortunately that is not the case, as their rulings on many contentious issues such as same sex marriage, pollution, race and redistrcting, Citizens United, ACA, and Bush v. Gore were decided by 5-4 votes along the party lines. I should also remind you that many conservatives who disliked Trump held their nose and voted for him particularly because he would fill the judicial positions with conservatives. As some of his most unqualified judicial nominees have been confirmed because of his conservative credentials, it makes little sense for Democrats to let Republicans do whatever they want with the courts. GOP's judiciary and Supreme Court takeover will have a powerful effect on the society for the next decades, on everything from the environment and healthcare to civil rights and corporate finance. This will be the biggest damage Trump has done."
'It is though. You take whatever (legal or ethical) approach you can to accomplish the goal.  Which he did. Personal opinion can’t stop you from doing your job. That’s exactly a qualification you want for a Supreme Court Justice \n\nIf you look at how Kavanaugh has ruled, he has ruled against his party on big topics many times. He is not a party follower with his rulings. '
"His opinions have been similar to where his party stands regarding key issues such as environment and national surveillance. On the issue of abortion and ACA, though he did not give what some right-wingers had hoped, he still leans conservative. There is uncertainty as to what he will do to them as Supreme Court justice, but his opinions won't be any savior to liberals. Some hardline conservatives indeed opposed his nomination because of their own purity test, yet it does not mean Republicans oppose him as a whole, as other conservative groups have pushed Kavanaugh's nomination. His opinions will definitely not be free from his own conservative agenda (just as none of the Supreme Court justices have been), and they will be more favorable to GOP than Roberts and Kennedy's have been."

'Exactly. I had a little just after the election because those that thought Trump was going to work for them had been conned. But after everything that has come out post-election I have zero sympathy for any Trump loyalist with their head still in the sand.'
"We need more empathic discussion.\n\nWe need to be the people reaching out and having thoughtful conversations with others. About politics yes, but we need to focus on how the other party in the conversation feels and why they feel the way they do. We need to present facts in a way that guides the other party's emotions in a positive direction. \n\nWe need to start more political conversations in neutral environments, but we need to do so with tolerance and without judgement. Befriend people and discuss their opinions then discuss, in a friendly manner, why you think the way you do.\n\nThis takes a large amount of time and can be very frustrating. Don't engage on days where you aren't up to snuff. People can sense when you're getting frustrated and sometimes you may say things in a way that puts them off further.\n\nAs far as making people more discerning, this is harder than changing people's minds.  Read articles with them, if it's appropriate, then discuss what you thought about it. Keep in mind certain things:\n\nRhetoric vs. Factual argument\n\nOpinion pieces are held to much lower journalistic standards\n\nHistory and motive of author\n\nThe only way we can change people's minds is by genuinely caring about the way that they think. That means that we will have the most success in discussions with people we care about where we force ourselves to be empathetic and patient."
"I would also like to share some thoughts that keep me levelheaded and more personable in political discussions.\n\nI strongly believe that you and I and every other human being are absolutely no different in our core. Under the right genetic and experiential circumstances I believe that anyone could be an Albert Einstein, highly influential with incredible concern for the human condition. Conversely, I also believe that anyone, under the exact wrong conditions, is capable of great atrocity. In this way every other person is a mirror in which we can see ourselves.\n\nThis might be stupid to you or anyone else reading this, but this thought has helped guide me through the most important conversations I've had with other people and I think it will help guide me through a few more. I hope that it helps anyone who reads this find the patience to change other people's minds."
"Guys, Boris is right.  Hear him out.  \n\nHe's just trying to make America as great as it used to be, like before the Civil Rights Act and stuff."

"They like Bush a lot more now that we have Trump. God, I hope former President Trump's doesn't get rehabilitated the same way."
'They didn’t let her off the hook. She took a shitload of heat bc of that bs investigation. One of the biggest factors her political career is now over, and for what? For negligence. That’s not even a crime. A crime requires intent. What she did was done by a bunch of other government officials who didn’t know any better or were not careful enough (negligence) with regards to work emailing. She sent emails from her personal email account. '
"You're so sharp and well written, clear thinking. Thank you so much for your reply.  "
"There are no implications. Multiple federal agencies approved the deal, including nine cabinet members (unanimously).\n\nIt was perfectly legal, and Clinton couldn't have stopped it even if she wanted to. The most she could have done was raise an objection, in which case the matter would have been referred to the president."
'I think you\'re confused. The United States didn\'t own these uranium mines. So Russia wouldn\'t be "selling it back to us." They\'d be mining the uranium in the United States and selling it to companies in the United States.\n\nPut simply, Uranium One, the Canada-based company that owned the mines, had licenses for mining and extraction, not for export. The expectation, in light of the NRC\'s assessment, would have been that the uranium mined would be marketed in America (with the profits going to Russia).'

"Muellers team have been working since May 2017 so its only 11 months, but It sure feels longer. Trump actually managed to be POTUS without a Special Counsel investigating him for nearly 4 whole months. So well done there.\n\n Also please stop using the words 'literally' and 'nothing' until you have looked up their definitions. Your incorrect use of those words make you look ill informed at best, and functionally illiterate at worst."

"When I say there literally is nothing so far. There truly is nothing so far on obstruction or collusion. Mueller announced the other day that Trump isn't being investigated as a criminal in this case anymore. \n\nBut to me that just seems like a ploy to get Trump to admit to something. \n\nI personally don't think Trump himself colluded. He has the biggest mouth on planet Earth and can't even fire someone without tweeting about it first. If anyone colluded it would be people within the campaign. And if they did it of course they wouldn't tell Trump. They know about his mouth just like everyone else. "

"As much as I'd miss my lovely internet neighbors, having all of them in one easy to observe cesspool is probably really helpful in keeping an eye on their dangerous brand of idiocy."
'Normally I am a "live and let live" type too, but they are really stretching the limit of free speech. If it was all memes and jokes, fine. But they do not stop there, they doxx people, they brigade other subs, they make it their mission to dissuade people from civilized discourse. These are clear violations of Reddit\'s rules, and they are happy to keep doing it as they have had to face no consequences.

'
'True - but it stands a better chance of landing him in jail, and may produce more of a change of heart among the Congressional GOP.'
'I don’t know... But, if I’m going to do a little purely hi-octane speculation:\n\n1. Partnership to undermine and cooperate against something China is doing.\n\n2. Letting the Russians know that if they continue with their all out fuckery with our democratic process, we have some sort of kill switch in place that will seriously fuck them six ways from Sunday. Maybe we’ll false flag some sort of attack on ourselves or another country and blame them. Or maybe they’ve planned something similar and we’re letting them know we’re on to them.\n\n3. Something to do with North Korea. \n\n4. Sharing intelligence about a planned ISIS plot in either country.\n\n5. Pushing a deal on Syria because we have incriminating evidence of Russian chemical weapons being used there.\n\n6. Sharing intelligence about the Iranian Nuclear program.\n\n7. The worlds greatest game of dungeons and dragons.\n\n8. There is an alien fleet heading towards Earth and their sharing info to plan for the defense of an imminent planetary invasion.\n\n9. The Nazi’s discovered that the lost continent of Atlantis is actually Antarctica, and there are the ruins of a highly technologically advanced ancient alien civilization buried beneath the miles of ice.\n\n10. US intelligence has chosen to sellout the colonel, and pass the Russians the super secret recipe of 21 herbs and spices in Kentucky Fried Chicken.\n\nI’m like 98% certain it’s about the Russian Interference/collusion thing or the KFC thing.\n\n'
'My only solace in this whole shitshow is that the Russians (or unwitting supporters of the Russians) like this guy, are completely F****** moronic.'
'Well, no, I agree that the crew you listed are both dirty, and complicit. Ryan\'s "family" comment, McConnell\'s threat to make any announcement about concerns over Russian campaign meddling into a partisan shitstorm etc are pretty good indications of that. Also the [Dallas Morning News\'](https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2017/12/15/putins-proxies-helped-funnel-millions-gop-campaigns) investigations - pretty direct evidence of entanglement with Russian campaign money.\n\nI still hold out hope that the majority of the Congressional GOP are *just* complicit in the coverup and the refusal to act, and *not* actually implicated and guilty of crimes, but that hope fades a little more every day.'
'If someone is complicit in the coverup it is almost certain they have a partial knowledge of the greater crimes. Assuming they are not guilty of these crimes themselves.\n\n'
'This exchange stuck with me all this time, and always bugged me that nobody seems to remember it.\n\nTrump people seem to write off the "Russia if you\'re listening" comment as a joke -- but this clearly shows it wasn\'t a joke.'
"Yeah... Maybe if we saw the whole thing in context it'd be more clear, or a transcript. I'm posting this stuff from a perspective of intellectual integrity as I do wish Trump would get impeached asap."
'So the Pay to Play internet plan the Trump administration tried to push was because they were getting paid off millions by AT&T. \n\nMakes sense why a bunch of old lobbyists were so concerned over a bill dissolving the free internet for Americans.'
'It’s good to know the bias, thanks for sharing. That same link also shows a high degree of factual reporting, so I wonder how you came to the conclusion of fake news?'
"So...be pretty cool if someone flexed the ol' anti-bribery laws, then."
'I hope he browses this sub and sees that he’s a meme now. Congratulations. '
"You'll know things are really picking up when this guy actually actually comments on something. His job may be easy now but when it's time for team Mueller to confront the world about their findings, he's going to need to know the in and out of every document, interview, and connection made in the investigation. \n\nI'm sure he'll do well though. "
"Took me a while. Love that there's a secret code way of saying nothing. "
"I love that they don't politicize the investigations. That's how we know it's real. Sharks don't announce how they're going to attack."
"It's pretty amazing how few leaks we've had since Mueller took over the investigation. Seems most of the leaks are now coming from the Trump administration itself. Mueller is damn good at what he does. I'm looking forward to his full report. "
"Guess we'll find out. I won't pretend to know what Mueller has in mind, but I hope he won't leave us in the dark. "
'You\'re right. Rich guys who have a ton of money are constantly saying, "No. Please don\'t give me any more money. I have enough."'
'He’s only pretending to be rich. Why are you ok with that lie?'
'I actually agree with this with the additional point that the info would help reporters connect the dots a bit quicker. I assume Mueller can get these records anyway.'
'I love when people talk about Trump and polls... reminds of the Clinton 92% & Trump 8% chance of winning, the NYT put out before the election. Please screencap this so I can eat my words.'
"It isn't a poll of Fox News viewers.\n\nIt's a poll of all registered voters, taken by ODC, Opinion Dynamics Corp.\n\nAlmost all News organizations outsource their polls. The firewall between the news organizations and polls was best demonstrated in 2012 when Fox News was condemning polls showing Obama will be favored while failing to mention that their own Fox News/ODC poll was the one that most heavily favored Obama.\n\nThe only poll that's notoriously biased is Rasmussen, which is why you hear Trump quoting it all the time."
"Because we admire the Special Counsel and his team for not leaking information. They are here for justice, not glory, and talking about their case has zero value for them or for us.  \n  \nBy comparison, look at what happened when the Special Counsel team handed over their evidence regarding Michael Cohen to the Manhattan FBI and US Attorney's offices: leaks, leaks, leaks."
"Depends how you look at it.\n\nThere are three types of populations for polls.\n\n**Adults**\n\n**Registered Voters** - a subset of Adults\n\n**Likely Voters** - a subset of Registered Voters\n\nGallup, and a couple others use **Adults**, meaning **All Adults across the US**.\n\nMost Organizations use **Registered Voters**, except when it's polling for a specific election, in which case they'll use **Likely Voters**, a subset of Registered Voters that are deemed Likely vote using the polling organizations desired methodology.\n\nIn the case of Rasmussen, all polls are **Likely Voters**. This is bizarre because even approval rating, a measurement in which most voters aren't even asked if they are likely to vote in any specific election, are somehow selected by Rasmussen using their own flexible methodology.\n\nSo that makes you wonder how Rasmussen selects for **Likely Voters** as a subset within the respondents. Unfortunately, you won't find the full methodology being released. You also won't find the raw data ever being released to any of the official polling organization for review. The fact that they release neither their methodology nor their data is incredibly suspect.\n\nBear in mind, it was once one of the best polling organizations. However, those days are in the past."
'http://fivethirtyeight.com has some very good discussion on this. As u/tlydon007 points out, methodology can skew polling results even when polling organizations like to say they are looking at the same populations. If you want to dig in to the details: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeight-calculates-pollster-ratings/'
'Let\'s give credit to the career professionals at the FBI and the Department of Justice for understanding the historic impact of their work and how important it is to speak with one voice—only when all the facts are known and honest, good-faith conclusions can be drawn.  \n  \nAlso, the team takes after its leader and Mr. Mueller has never been "media friendly."'
'That’s as interesting as it is informative. Thank you, friend. '
"Why would law or truth matter within a legal investigation...? But hey, at least Fox News is reporting on popular opinion... I'm guessing it's an option you share?"
"This is also why I think the FISA court needs reform. As I understand it, the Chief Justice selects FISA court judges, meaning it's been decades since anyone not a Republican has been making the choices. I would prefer to see a rotation of the responsibility to select FISA judges rotated among all SCOTUS justices, encouraging a broader view of privacy and the 4th Amendment than just people who agree with Chief Justice Roberts."
"I don't know, seems to be working great in bringing these guys to justice so far.\n\nBut clearly if you're arguing from a point of party politics then maybe they should put democrats on the courts too."
'"secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects" this would involve appending the amendment ratified. They would have to add "in transmission or channel" (Channel to protect cryptography). Not that I disagree, just not possible with 90% of state\'s attempting to do the opposite.  '
"I'm referring to reforming the Foreign Intelligence and Surveillance Act (FISA), not the 4th Amendment. Networks and so on are already protected under current interpretations of the 4th Amendment. My concern is with the narrow views of the Chief Justice and the judges he appoints to the FISA court."

'So, you are a bit delusional. But I’m feeling charitable, so I’m going to dignify you with a response. \n\nYou’re conflating and confusing a large variety of things. You’re also assuming that I’m supporting a “liberal/progressive” movement by celebrating application of the law. I’m not even a registered Democrat... I personally do not care for the hardcore “SJW” types, as I hold it as one of my core principles that **the road to hell is paved with the best of intentions**. From a broader historical perspective, while they are progressive in stated intent, their methods resemble Puritanism. I do not believe that the ends justify the means, so while I may agree with some of their ends, I think their means are to the detriment of their cause. \n\nBut they are not an aspect of some grander conspiracy. I agree that there are many psychopaths in many different social and political movements. Some do a better job of quarantining or expelling those elements than others. \n\nBut to extrapolate personal anecdotal experience to some kind of grand conspiracy is a bridge too far. \n**You’re acting out what is called “illusory pattern perception”.**\n\nMore importantly, it doesn’t achieve anything. It’s neither helpful nor productive to assume that everything you don’t like is a part of a single grand scheme. It blinds you to reality, stripping you of your ability to act.\n\nI think we’d agree that there are absolutely groups that seek to cloud people’s judgement and compel them to live in a fantasy world. If you can’t identify or talk about something in concrete meaningful terms, you can’t effect any change. \n\n**You should strongly consider reevaluating who those groups are, and which ones are currently most dangerous.**\n\nStart by asking this: what group of people most romanticizes politics? What group of people most strongly reduces politics and ideology to aesthetics and branding? What group _must_ continuously invent or designate enemies in order to maintain cohesion? What group is defined as being _against_ certain things, rather than _for_ certain things? \n\nEverything you’ve just said actually does probably apply to the constellation of alt-right/white nationalist/etc movements, which have practiced leaderless federation (like al Qaeda) for decades. This is a pattern that is substantiated by law enforcement reports (look up the spaghetti dinners), unlike what you’re suggesting. '

'> 1) Obama was worshipped by the media, and he still is. In fact, Obama exacerbated racism by being as divisive as he was. By the way, you may recall Rosen , a real journalist, was spies on by Obama and his cronies.\n\nObama [is actually okay with criticism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HO-9AZjflY) and this recording of him shows that he understands why it\'s important.  Meanwhile you have a sitting President call his critics "fake news".  His mountain of Twitter fires is an embarrassingly funny and horrifying thing to watch because of what this implies.  Here is a great video from Republican Senator Jeff Flakes on [Trump\'s Stalin-like attacks on the press](http://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/fl-op-jeff-flake-trump-media-attacks-20180119-story.html).  Sure there are biases.  And depending on where you sit, it\'s almost deafening depending on how sensitive your hearing is.  But no President should ever attack the press the way Trump has.  It\'s detrimental to our Republic and democracy.\n\nSo again, out of the two, which President attacked the press for doing their job?  It\'s pretty obvious.\n\n> 2) You deserve credit that Teddy applied his statement to himself and all past and future presidents; however, it is common knowledge that Obama is a narcissist and would never handle criticism with grace, but neither does Trump, so what ... probably need a big ego to be POTUS. As far as Trump’s tweets, people like me sincerely appreciate the unfiltered message, a message that the MSM cannot easily diffuse. Alas, Obama has the press eating from his hand and he was not vetted adequately in 2006/2007. If he were I’m confident Hillary would have just finished her 2nd term.\n\nHere is an interesting article titled, [7 signs you\'re dating a narcissist...](http://www.businessinsider.com/narcissistic-personality-disorder-signs-2018-4).  I can\'t think of a better example of a narcissist than Trump.  He is the classic example of narcissism.  You could even say he\'s the best at it.\n\n> 3) As a corporate leader myself, I expect my staff’s loyalty and they freely give it to me as we’re in sync for what we want to accomplish. I think the POTUS deserves loyalty, after all, Holder held Obama’s water for him and there is no argument of that. By the way, look back at Obama’s first year, with all the czar appointments and his preponderance of socialist ideology. Those cronies were very loyal to Obama as he rushed out hundreds of billions of dollars for “shovel ready jobs”, for Solyndra, and too many other instances to note here, but you get the gist. Also, how loyal was Obama to Lois Lerner as she has her full pension even though she broke federal law, but the loyalist Obama didn’t investigate with integrity.\n\nAs a former military leader, you would think that I expected loyalty and respect from those under me.  But I never once did in my near decade of service.  Instead, I chose to lead by example.  Because ultimately I wanted to earn their trust.  A good leader commands from a position of trust and not of fear.  If I happen to gain their respect then fine.  But that isn\'t an objective in itself.  Getting the job done is.\n\nTo demand loyalty, or to even ask for a loyalty oath, is categorically un-American as I\'ve pointed out earlier.  \n\n> 4) Re Trump opting out of the Vietnam war - did Obama serve? Was he even eligible to serve? Maybe one day in the not too distant future much truth will be revealed about Obama and many will not believe the truth. Time will tell...\n\nI\'ve spent a quite a bit of time reflecting on my own military service, especially now that I\'ve been out, and wonder if I had made a difference at all.  On sleepless nights like this, I would think about the decisions I\'ve made not only about my time in but also life in general.  Sometimes I would turn to biographies and history to aid me with these questions.  What is it that made some people heroes and some people not?  And I believe it comes down to how ordinary people respond to extraordinary situations.  \n\nTake for example the [remarkable story of combat medic awarded Medal of Honor](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/remarkable-story-combat-medic-awarded-medal-honor-48954452).  MOH recipient Jim Moore was one of countless draftees into the Army during the Vietnam War.  And despite great danger to himself, he saved ten of his fellow soldiers while under enemy fire for around 48 hours.\n\nDuring Vietnam, with the draft and our nation at war, sometimes that decision to be in the Army was made for them.  This isn\'t to take away from those who served during the draft.  But, to me, it does amplify the actions of those who chose precisely to avoid it.  While Jim Moore, John McCain, and many others suffered through their extraordinary experiences because of the Vietnam War in 1968, the 21 year old Trump [had it pretty good](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/07/20/what-donald-trump-was-up-to-while-john-mccain-was-suffering-as-a-prisoner-of-war/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.5a7315afc9eb).  After dodging the war, he lived a privileged life paid for by his peers.  One of whom (John McCain) whom he had the gall to say was not a war hero for being a POW during the Vietnam War. \n\nAnd due to these sacrifices by these Americans, and no thanks to Trump, Obama grew up in a period of relative peace and optimism by the time he was of age.  Would he have dodged the war had he been born years earlier?  That\'s hard to say and pointless to speculate on.  After all, you can\'t have war heroes nor draft dodgers without a war.\n\n> I’m not here to argue with you, but constructive criticism as we are having here may be beneficial to our country, but the divisiveness of political polarity at this time portends a major shock before normalization may set in again. IDK :-/\n\nWe should be constructively critical and be wary of the divisiveness of the current political climate.  Something I wish President Trump would work towards through example.  But I can\'t think of a President in recent times who has done more to damage constructive criticism nor fan the divisiveness of the parties.\n\n> With an open mind and mediocre reasoning skills anyone can acknowledge that Trump has and continues to bring change to America, and mostly good imvho. My heritage comes from an Eastern European country that was under communist rule. Believe me when I say we don’t need that here! Let’s keep America the land of the free and the home if the brave. We can, you know, but it takes discipline and work - something many fail to understand.\n\nI am a Conservative who urged others to keep an open mind and to "give him a chance" when he surprisingly won the election.  Obviously I don\'t do that anymore.  While I didn\'t vote for him, I was not a fan of Hillary.  Also because of my heritage, I am vehemently against dictators and communism.  But because I\'m an American, I am about the rule of law.  Above any partisanship.  That no one is above the law.  Especially not even a sitting POTUS.'
"Eh, Trump is a subject but not *currently* target of an investigation *at this time*.  But he is looked into for obstruction of justice at the very least.  Pages are still turning.

They are an admitted wild card only having a poor 2 year governance of Ontario in the 80s. On the other hand, having the options is a positive overall.    '

'Well, Fox "News" is his biggest mainstream reporter, and they\'re not even legally a news broadcaster.\n\nThe media should most certainly not release any evidence at this time, this process and Mueller\'s investigation need to be untainted, now more than ever. Strict by-the-book lawmanship will win out, because if there is no mud to sling, the Trump supporter base slowly shrinks.'
"That's a fair way of looking at it.\n\nIf this were a set diagram, then 'conspiracy' and 'bribery' would be overlapping circles inside 'criminality' which is itself a circle inside  a larger circle of 'collusion'.  By denying 'collusion' Trump denies all illegality inside the biggest circle.\n\nThere remains another possibility outside the collusion circle, however, in that Russia supported Trump of its own free will, independent of Trump's actions, perhaps with knowledge of Trump's (blackmailable) corrupt finances with respect to Russia.  Just having a pee-pee tape is a good reason to support Trump.\n"

He has to go after a mindless 22 year old who was so idiotic the Secret Service called her a stalker.  The little gendered slur would actually hide in empty offices and closets waiting to get a chance to meet with him.  They should have sent her back to California. \n\nI have wondered in my mind if Hillary would have been better off if she had divorced him.  No way of knowing how much real respect, friendship and passion are between them.  I think I would leave my husband if he pulled such an abysmally tawdry and foolish stunt like that.  What crap judgment. '
'If my husband wants his dick sucked by someone other than me, he had better be upfront about it.  And vice versa. It is not the sex, it is the dishonesty.  THAT is the problem.

'Technically while Clinton was impeached, he was only impeached in the House but acquitted of both articles of impeachment in the Senate. I’m no legal expert but I believe acquitted isn’t the same thing as guilty. \n\n> February 12, the Senate voted on whether to remove Clinton from office. The president was acquitted on both articles of impeachment. The prosecution needed a two-thirds majority to convict but failed to achieve even a bare majority. Rejecting the first charge of perjury, 45 Democrats and 10 Republicans voted “not guilty,” and on the charge of obstruction of justice the Senate was split 50-50. After the trial concluded, President Clinton said he was “profoundly sorry” for the burden his behavior imposed on Congress and the American people.\n\nhttps://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/12/19\n\nMeanwhile Nixon admitted guilt for crimes during Watergate by accepting Ford’s pardon:\n\n>At a 2014 panel discussion, Ford’s lawyer during that period, Benton Becker, explained another part of the President’s motivation was a 1915 Supreme Court decision, Burdick v. United States, which made Nixon accept his guilt in the Watergate controversy by also accepting the pardon.\n\n>The Court’s ruling in Burdick was that a pardon carried an "imputation of guilt" and accepting a pardon was "an admission of guilt.” Becker said he took copies of the Burdick decision to California when he met with former President Nixon, and under Ford’s instructions, he walked through the Burdick decision with Nixon.\n\n>Becker said the discussion with Nixon was very difficult, and the former President kept trying to change the subject way from Burdick until he acknowledged Becker’s discussion about what the Supreme Court decision meant.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/constitutioncenter.org/amp/blog/the-nixon-pardon-in-retrospect-40-years-later\n\nThe two are not the same.'

It is absolutely possible that Trump is exonerated or at least not directly implicated. The investigation isn't directly about him...it's about Russian meddling in our election. We keep forgetting this because Trump's ties to Russia are numerous. "

"This is known.  The question is who did they assist and did they know?\n\nSome say it's against trump.  I disagree, I say they are seeing which (if any) campaign personnel were involved.  It may very well lead to Trump, but that is not the intent.\n\nIt could also be he was completely oblivious to all of these people in his campaign (and family?) making shady deals/meetings with Russians.  That would mean he was the most ignorant person/father to ever run for office.  I personally don't think he's that dumb/ill informed.  I think he is like a mafia boss.  Keeps his hands as clean as possible and has his people commit the crimes. But that's just my opinion, let's see what comes out of the investigation."
"It's almost like there's bipartisan support that Trump is a piece of shit."
'I just don’t understand how or why why Trump is the person people blindly support. He’s a proven conman that has been mired in the exact corruption that he ran on eliminating, and is just a prime example of when you think everyone is an asshole (I.e. dems, some Republicans, the intelligence community, and the media), then it’s probably you.'
'Yup. My roommate has an MD and is liberal on a lot of issues including gay marriage, drugs and abortion. Don’t ask me why he votes republican or supports Trump because I honestly can’t answer. '
"I highly doubt she believed or cared. She was just going along with her husband.\n\nDo I feel bad for her? No, not really. However, so what if she wanted to get married to a wealthy guy? She just wanted US citizenship, someone to take care of her, etc. There's no love or empathy in their marriage, and Melania doesn't even care that he cheats on her. She probably can't divorce him without losing access to her son.\n\nI bet they will get divorced, and she will marry another wealthy guy. Then she'll get to live happily ever after with her son."
'When you are with someone for long enough, some of their bs definitely rubs off on you lol '
'Lol the salt from t_d thats already here is delicious. '
"I voted for her, and I'd vote for her again in another matchup against Donald Trump, but can we please not make Hillary out to be a hero? She's not a hero. She should've been prosecuted for her actions (even a misdemeanor), and if she had been, then perhaps the right wouldn't be expecting Trump to be let off the hook."
"If the FBI would have raided her office to seize her email server instead of trying to get it by grand jury subpoena, she might well be under indictment today, so don't be too smug about the other tribe's legal problems."
"was going to down vote but i'll up vote. I'd rather public see the most corrupt person to run for office getting off scott free because of hammers and bleach bit."
'everything riles them up, there is no point in trying to protect their precious feelings'

"No, mostly Gowdy who was the most outspoken member of congress about the Clinton benghazigate shit. Gowdy is pretty well regarded as a partisan hack, but he was well respected prosecutor before entering politics. The most important note is that he is from a very safe district in SC.  He recently made the announcement he is retiring from politics. Speculation is he knows shit is about to hit the fan and he's distancing himself from the crazy. He's seen things, and they ain't pretty. "
"But... The answer to OP's rhetorical question is still yes. Gowdy *did* help draft the memo and *did* vote to release it, regardless what he's since said. "
"That place needs more love, but I guess Russian bots aren't into throwing out support for their own politicians."
'That doesn\'t tell us anything about whether the approval rate should be as high as it is, though. You can\'t use "the warrants are only applied for when they know they\'ll be approved" as a stand-in for "the warrants must be justified" while ignoring that we don\'t know what the bar for approval is.'
"I bet he has a regular sleep cycle, but every morning with a cup of coffee in hand he'll asked to be briefed. He's got what, 100 people working for him?"
"I like how people think I'm bashing Mueller. I thought it was pretty awesome seeing him on the ice."
'"The Coverup" (2017):\n\nJared (Michael Cera) had always lived a "Kushy" life where things always seemed to just come easy -- the blonde (Scarlett Johansson), the acceptance into Harvard, the business, and the buildings. Just when he thought he had it all, he even got his own office in the West Wing! But after selling building 666 in Manhattan to the devil himself (Benedict Cumberbatch), Jared gets more than he "bargained" for when God himself appoints slick attorney Robert Mueller (Robert DeNiro) to investigate the deal. Will Jared be able to keep coasting through life, or will he learn that some things in life come at a price that Daddy\'s money can\'t buy? \n\nCome see the comedy that Fake News is calling "distressful" --- \'The Coverup\', in theatres this holiday treason.'
'God DAMN!!!! Mueller has a bad ass jaw! He could swallow that little cuck whole'
"I like talking to them to see how long before they say, “i'm not racist, but...”\n\n"
"I'm always surprised when a comment like this doesn't generate a hypocritical singularity of irony."
'Republicans have taken almost 1000 legislative seats through these shenanigans and stuffed the courts with their highly partisan judges all the way up to the Supreme court.  When Democrats win 50% of the vote, they still get less than half of the representation.  I do not advocate for an unfair advantage for democrats, I advocate taking actions to level the playing field.'
'Happy F(5)riday!'
"Roger Stone's a good pick but I think that's further down the road.  GRU would be nice but personally I expect a lot has been done through the private sector so I'd like to see some oligarchs st some point.  My honest guess at this point in the investigation is most likely individuals we don't know about yet.  My wildcard's Bolton, who's shady as fuck and creepy for Russia interests in the Republican Party as well as destroying US standing internationally while leaving us indefensible by overstretching our military abroad."
'While Giuliani is a giant douche.... his Law Firm send out statements to all the Trump transition team warning them that  having Russians help get elected is illegal... he also looks okay in drag...and apparently enjoys it...  So... '
'Happy cake day!'
"McConnell is a god damn corrupt Traitor. He married the daughter of a corrupt Chinese shipping magnate. (Cough....90 lbs of Cocaine....Cough) He stole a Supreme Court seat. He's become insanely wealthy even though he's spent his whole career in Government. He refused to let the American public know what Russia was doing because it was helping his team. He's purely party over country at all junctures. And now he's blocking a BIPARTISAN bill to protect Mueller from Trump. **WHY?** What exactly does Putin have on Mitch? \n\nTime for the next administration to order a complete investigation into the McConnell / Chao Crime syndicate. There's plenty there there. "
"Save it. I can't handle any more good news. "
'Presumably then America would be locked in till the next election where hopefully someone else can get in and a respect for the democratic process can be re-established.'
'I used to support a lot of Republicans. John and Linc Chafee, Jim Jeffords, and most of those New England Republicans. Yes, they were for small government, but not over fucking over America or the American people. Then the party got radicalized and ate their own. \n\nI thought I was becoming more liberal as I’ve aged. But the more I think about it, I’m certain I haven’t moved, but the media has moved the playing field. \n\nIn 39. While growing up, white nationalists, for the most part, had the common decency to stay hidden.  '
'It wasn\'t decency that kept white nationalists hidden, it was that they were discouraged by various factors.\n\nThe so-called "social justice warriors" were right about one thing: bigotry has always been pervasive in the United States. We all need to do a better job a dealing with this issue by inspiring hope that engaging in bigotry does not at all prevent you from the opportunity of improving the world. Sometimes people have to be ridiculed and shamed, but the core strategy has to fundamentally involve giving people hope. '
'Well thanks for admitting this is a witch hunt. I wonder if he’ll also indict trump 2nd cousins wife’s uncle’s best friends co-workers former girl friend for stealing that pack of gum from Walmart that one time back in the 80’s. So glad we kept focused on....wait what was this investigation about again, I can’t remember anymore? \n\nGive up, you’ve got 2.5 more years buddy and I’m not sure you’ve got enough tears to keep crying for that long. '
'It’s so great that I can go to trump humper pages and be derided as a lib and come here and I’m a red hat wearing MAGAnator. In reality I’m just not an ignorant partisan lemming and partisan lemmings like trump supporters and trump haters can’t understand that.'
"Luckily we have one of the top minds of Reddit here to tell us the error of our ways and how libertarianism will save us all\n\nDon't worry, I used to be a libertarian too until I turned 23. You'll either figure out that the world won't work that way or you'll be one of those 40 year old guys who fetishize Ayn Rand on internet forums for the rest of their life"
'If you want a meaningful conversation then pick a time and platform, and we can talk about those evidences. Till then, Make America Great Again. hahaha and this is a gift for you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEG41O5Y9-k&t=7s'
'I know right! If we just give up our freedom to the correct dictator or ruling class it will all be sunshine and unicorn farts. \n\nWe have trumpublicans telling us stalin just didn’t do it right and libtopians saying mao just didn’t do it right. We just need to send those darned dissenters to the camps! Personal freedom is overrated and so last century. It’s 2018 komrades! '
"> I know right! If we just give up our freedom to the correct dictator or ruling class it will all be sunshine and unicorn farts.\n\nFor a second there I almost missed the marionette strings that the Koch brothers were holding. Libertarians are just as manipulated by those in charge, and to a worse end. The rich ruling class use libertarians to push anti-regulation, anti-worker, and anti-middle class propaganda. Trickle down economics, abolishing the minimum wage, all that garbage is just rich people using Libertarians for their own agenda. It's exactly why it won't work in real life, it only makes the system and the people more easily manipulable when you remove accountability and expect everyone to play nice. In real life, people don't play nice. Our system of government is far from perfect, but a glance at a history book will show you why an absentee government is a bad idea."
'Wao, what a compelling comeback.  Is this the best the_dumbasses have to offer?'
"haha Did you watch the video I posted? Hope you liked it. Till then you should go and ask your Trump, if he likes to grab some p****. I heard he love to do that. Is that true? I don't think Mueller does that, so I don't know how it feels like to grab a woman's p**** without her consent. \nThat's just an appetizer for you, if you want more, then let me know. Trump has many other great qualities too.  "
'Yes, if we increase freedom and limit govt power then the big evil Koch brothers will use that freedom against us! Libertarians, trying to take over the world and leave you alone! '
'Translation for impact and clarity: "The President\'s senior advisor SON-IN-LAW has security clearance downgraded"\n\nLet\'s hope we never have to see a headline like that again.'
"Jared don't start blushing, but I think Mueller's got eyes for you. Happy belated Valentines Day buddy. Enjoy ;)"
'BUT HOW IS HE GOING TO MAKE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST NOW?!?'
'If the downgrade was not signed by Chief of Staff, does it even work? Also, he was downgraded from "top secret" to "secret" — should we really count it as a big win? :('
'Apparently Secret is basic, like clipped newspaper articles that might reveal a person of interest, that kind of level.\n\nOne thing is clear if it’s a legit downgrade he can no longer do his job, you need all the intel the other side has to be an effective negotiator/representative.'
'While this is true, Sensitive Compartmented Information is declassified to individuals on a "need to know" basis.  Even persons with Top Secret clearance must individually have a "need to know" the specific intelligence that\'s in the document.\n\nSo, the fact that the President, under Dept. of the Navy v. Egan, has broad powers to determine "need to know" is a bit of a trap... the more intel that Trump declassifies to Kushner in cases where he *clearly* does not have a need to know will only tangibly hurt Trump\'s credibility (Mueller may present it before a Judge or Grand Jury to demonstrate a pattern of conspiracy) and raise the suspicions of all around him... This will also increase the probability of more rats turning on Trump.'
'That and the fact he’s nearly bankrupt from buying666 Fifth Ave. at the peak of the Real Estate Bubble.  Pretty easy for a friendly Russian oligarch to buy a son-in-law.\n\nETA: just saw [this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/kushners-overseas-contacts-raise-concerns-as-foreign-officials-seek-leverage/2018/02/27/16bbc052-18c3-11e8-942d-16a950029788_story.html) article; at least 4 governments were discussing ‘manipulating’ the guy.'

"Why yes, he did lie to the FBI, and this plea document is one small part of a broader investigation into the Trump campaign's collusion with Russia, which now has one legal document stating as a confession, that these things did in fact happen, that the Trump campaign did in fact collude with Russia as way to win the November 2016 election, and that Papadopoulos did play a part in this collusion with the Russian government. I'm glad we both understand and agree that this is in fact the current state of things, being that Mueller is investigating the Trump campaign's collusion with Russian officials and has now produced a confession from Papadopoulos admitting to those events taking place, with a timeline of events of contacts with Russians and Trump campaign officials."
"OK, so we agree he didn't plead guilty for collusion.\n\nCollusion isn't a crime. The DNC paid foreign nationals to draft the fake dossier. This collusion you speak of is opposition research. But depending on what side of the aisle it's on determines the word you use. That's ok. Whatever."

They are afraid of the reactions from their family and friends. It is sad people have to live a lie becuase of discrimination, and I don\'t want that for them as much as I wouldn\'t want that for a gay person.

'As a hypothetical question do you believe that the major news outlets that are supposed to inform the public instead of providing a biased narrative serving as propaganda should be allowed to continue that behavior?

">As a hypothetical question do you believe that the major news outlets that are supposed to inform the public instead of providing a biased narrative serving as propaganda should be allowed to continue that behavior?\n\nI believe our founding principles have led to astounding levels of freedom and prosperity and aim to see the constitution upheld.

'Statistics are too easily manipulated to be worth anything. What I do is look at events like what just happened with the NFL for example. They are led to believe that ALL AMERICANS are supportive of this BLM/leftist/anti-Trump narrative and they pretty much forced many of those players to kneel. Then the same company that really is only concerned about profit sees how actual Americans actually react and they change their policy to tell them not to do that anymore. People can call it anecdotal like you just did, but more and more I hear from people a message of "I hate the guy but why does everything have to be about Trump." For me to hear that from people who have been wildly liberal since their hippy days is way more indicative of a changing tide than any slanted poll will ever be. I see the same thing being repeated by others in other parts of the country. Give it a little time and you will start to notice the same thing. If you were able to step outside of your narrative for a minute, haven\'t you seen the same pattern over and over? At first people get riled up about something, but gradually more and more lose interest and get back to what is actually important to them like their friends, family, and jobs. A hardcore group always remains with every president ever who will trash him with an unhealthily obsessive frequently, but that is not the pattern for the majority of people at all. Let my proof be time. Get back to me if it turns out I am wrong.   \n  \nEdit: maybe another example that might help you understand is the election. The news, the experts, the statistics went on and on about Hillary\'s guaranteed victory. Instead of listening to that I watched the footage of the massive stadiums he was filling with supporters compared to Tiny high school basketball courts that would be barely filled for her. I I tried to tell people this but was met with ridicule. I even had a relative that lost a lot of money betting on an online site because of how convinced they were by the mainstream media that you and others like you are still listening to.'
'You might not read them, but you are not the only person I am writing for in these forums when I respond to you. I have seen people start to come around and see things a little more clearly from time to time and that makes it worth being called names and mocked by people like you who probably have good intentions but have just been misled by people who are professionals at doing so.'
'>  Instead of listening to that I watched the footage of the massive stadiums he was filling with supporters compared to Tiny high school basketball courts that would be barely filled for her.\n\nI watched the final returns, which showed her winning three million more votes. So what does a "massive" stadium have to do with anything?'
'>A bit ironic that the traditionally tolerant left now feels justified in saying things like "love it or leave it."\n\nTo apply irony you need to understand the rest of the words you use.  The left has never been tolerant of real estate heirs trying to shut down the free press.  \n\n>I don\'t accept your hate in my version of American values.\n\nYou have no power over what I say.\n\n>I don\'t agree with you but I don\'t need to silence you\n\nYou support a real estate heir trying to shut down the free press because they say things he doesn\'t like.  Whooosh...'
'Thanks Roy. What a good dude he was. '
'That June 16 meeting most likely ended up with DJT letting his dad know, so there’s that. \nAnd although I don’t know Mueller, I know prosecutors, a couple federal ones. These guys PRIDE themselves on being morally superior and above politics so I assure you he’s going to be fair. '

And it was totally legal. Working in Russia isn\'t a crime, aiding and abetting them in an effort to undermine the electoral process however, is.\n\n>Didn\'t Hillary and Obama give Russia tons of uranium? \n\nNo. Russia\'s Rosatom purchased a controlling stake in the mining company Uranium One and with it 10-20% of our uranium reserves. Because of this, the transaction had to be overseen by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, of which Clinton was a cabinet member. The commitee had no say in whether or not the deal went through, their only job being to evaluate whether or not it presented a national security risk and inform the president of their findings. All nine members of the committee approved, and with that president Obama approved it. In addition, all that meant was that Rosatom held an economic stake in US uranium. We didn\'t give them any uranium, because exporting it would require additional approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. We did export and sell some of it, but none of it went to Russia.\n\n>Remember the quote " tell Putin i will have more flexibility after the election". \n\nOpenness to negotiation is not collusion nor illegal. \n\n>Didn\'t Podesta own shares in a Russian bank under his kids name?\n\nI know very little about this so I can\'t comment.

"Fair enough.\n\nThough I regard the GOP not wanting to double down on national security spending that ACTUALLY MATTERS because the spending bill has a lot of 'other stuff' as dispositive with regards to the GOPs commitment to ensuring free and fair elections in this country\n\nCouple this with the fact that they continue to block votes to protect the special council tells me everything I need to know about ever voting R again (saying this as someone who has voted R many times before)"
'I will add that, from what i understand, that indictment which details the setup of Guccifer 2.0 has a ton of detail in it from an IT security standpoint.

Many of them were in place when that sub was genuinely for political discussion, rather than what it has become now, which is a forum for gossip about Melania, opinion pieces, and speculation. It flat out says in the sidebar now that it\'s for "politcal news", in other words it\'s barely a step removed from facebook. If you subscribe to the sub, you know that every month or so, the mods post a sticky to discuss what the subscribers want to see done. The people who show up can\'t even agree on what they want to see, ie, last month, many of us wanted opinion pieces to be clearly tagged as opinion, because they aren\'t genuinely news. Many others didn\'t care. So it isn\'t happening. Democracy in action there.

'Applicable username.  3 indictments, 1 confirmed witness flip and 2 more obvious ones incoming.  He literally went to Jared to pressure Mike Flynn which means Flynn has at least some of the goods.  What bias, BTW?  Mueller is a Republican, who was appointed FBI Director by George W. Bush (a Republican), appointed by Rod Rosenstein (a Republican) and enjoys support from almost all Republican members of Congress.  Maybe leave the_Dumbass and Fox News for 5 seconds and you\'ll be able to see that the process is working as it should.     \nI want to tell you as a New Yorker, if you don\'t think Trump has skeletons in his closet working in NY real estate, you\'ve got another thing coming entirely.  Anything Mueller digs up as a result of the Russia investigation (money laundered apartments in Trump Tower and double-book-value real estate deals to Russian oligarchs in Palm Beach) are fair game.

I don\'t approve of the violent Antifa nuts, nor do I approve of the Brown Shirts on the other side.  I do, however, agree with respecting people\'s right to declare their gender because it costs us nothing and gives them a chance to be who they are.  There were studies where they did autopsies on transgender people and they found a specific element in their brain only found in the opposite gender, so their feeling is not altogether wrong, scientifically.  I\'m a big believer in kindness and acceptance because this world is harsh enough as it is to everyone.      \nI would also caution you from taking on a political philosophy based upon the behavior and actions of fringe groups.

"If he issues corrupt pardons in order to shut people up so they don't talk shit about him I'm thinking that's illegal."
"I wouldn't put it past him. Seems like most Americans are so out of touch with stuff like this and its easier for them to decide that its to much to take in. We're nearly desensitized to seeing another headline about something ridiculous that Trump did. "
'But it\'s on overdrive now. Faux "news" is now a state run propaganda arm of the WH and they aren\'t even hiding it anymore. Everyday they obstruct justice, commit sedition, and flat out lie to people all to try and discredit Mueller. It\'s 24/7 these days. They use words like coup and assasination attempts coming from the FBI. Its scary stuff but the FCC is owned by mango Mussolini as well and they already don\'t classify fox as news it\'s entertainment but they can still get away with calling themselves news for some reason.'
'That’s the thing. To accept a pardon you have to accept guilt, you must make yourself available for further questioning, and you can no longer take the fifth. Guess what happens to your pardon if you lie under oath or to the FBI.

'The [Benghazi ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_investigation_into_the_2012_Benghazi_attack) hearings went on for far longer and came up with just about nothing.

"My guess is if Trump were to really fire Mueller, he'd be sure to do it either the day before or after Christmas. That way most of the country would be too focused on family time to notice and those who do notice at all could easily be labelled un-American scrooges muddying the holiday spirit and trying to politicise in the wrong venue."
"Look man, you're committed to your perspective.

Paul Manafort anyone?\n\nInvestigations takes time, and there have been some major revelations that many people feel are quite important and deserve further investigation. And while you may not find the prosecution to have proven itself meaningfully, many of your fellow citizens feel very differently.\n\nAlso. If there isn't anything to discover, then why should anyone on Trump's team even bother with addressing the investigation? If there ain't anything there, why waste breath acknowledging it? Why not just let it run through to the end, knowing there ain't anything there?\n\nTo me the answer is clear because it's just the way life is: people who don't have anything to hide don't really worry about other folks going through their dirty laundry. \n\nYou may see things differently, but I really do want you to hear that I respect your right to your own perspective and hope you'll grant folks like me the same liberty."
"Do you think Mueller is going to invent evidence some how? Trump himself said Mueller will exonerate him when the investigation is complete, why would he fire someone that will be exonerating him? Mueller can't invent evidence, \n\n>Unless Mueller pulls something out of thin air soon this case is looking on the verge of collapse.\n\nSo Manifort, Popadopolous, Flynn inditments are all a nothing burger?\n\nHonestly you should take a step back an evaluate Trumps actions, then ask yourself - is that how an innocent person acts? If there is nothing to hide, why is he always trying to discredit the investigation?   "
"> Unless Mueller pulls something out of thin air soon this case is looking on the verge of collapse.\n\nI'm honestly curious how you can think this. They've indicted 3 people, flipped Papadopolous and Flynn and the investigation has been non-stop getting new information. \n\nThe investigation has only been going on since May and has only been ramping up, never winding down. It's just incredible to me that people can hold the opinion that the case is collapsing..."
'> a long, rapidly deteriorating investigation that has failed to yield any results\n\nInvestigations that are short are generally inconclusive.\n\nIt\'s certainly not "deteriorating", let alone rapidly, considering that charges are *just* beginning to be filed. Remember, this isn\'t the first time we\'ve seen this process, let alone even the first time for a sitting President. You don\'t take down someone like Flynn for just "lying" unless he\'s giving you something truly useful, and *those* indictments have yet to drop, because like anyone who\'s ever bothered to be *actually* involved in a legal case, you\'d know that you want to make it as airtight as possible, since if it isn\'t and they\'re acquitted, you can never bring a second case due to Constitutional protections against "double jeopardy", so you better be sure you\'ve covered everything possible the first time.\n\nAs for "failed to yield any results", I\'m confused what you think five indictments are. Manafort and Gates were the transition teams\' campaign managers, and they\'re going to be defending themselves in court soon against some pretty hefty federal charges, *before* they then get indicted on a state level. They\'re going to prison. Then you have not one, not two, but *three* individuals who have "flipped" and are cooperating with the FBI in exchange for leniency *if* they bring in the big fish. \n\nThat you think *any* of what you said in that sentence I quoted is true means you\'re either pushing your own narrative (for whatever reason, I don\'t care which because it doesn\'t matter), or you\'re willfully ignorant of what\'s actually going on here, if not just in outright denial because your ego can\'t handle the idea of being wrong.\n\nAs for Fox being "state propaganda", I\'m confused as to who exactly you think the Koch brothers are, and how you\'re so uninformed as to what they do, who they\'ve bought, how much power they wield, and as to how *anyone* has managed to just ignore the back and forth between Fox news and the White House. Fox doesn\'t have to be *literal" state propaganda (as in Trump is telling them what to air) to fulfill the *function*. So sure, maybe it is a bit dramatic to *call* it that, but it\'s absolutely SPOT FUCKING ON POINT when it comes to how the conservative propaganda machine works. \n\nI\'d say it\'s more fair to say that the Koch brothers are telling both the Trump administration *and* Fox news what to do. It\'s just a silent coup, no big deal, no need to dramatize it by calling it "state propaganda", it\'s easier and more accurate to call it a "state takeover by private elite citizens".\n\n----------\n\nSo while you\'re either a paid provocateur, an ignorant rube, or a delusional sycophant (and I say those as clinical descriptions of behavior, not pejoratives), I urge you to consider the counterarguments to your position - if you\'re so correct, your idea should stand up to self-scrutiny in the light of full information, shouldn\'t they?\n\n-----------\n\nEdit; one last thing, you used the word "reign" to describe Obama\'s presidency.

But I\'m sure the secret meetings between Russians directly connected to the Kremlin and Manafort, Flynn, Gates, Papadopoulos, Kushner, et al were just about adopting babies.  Riiight.  Trump knew Flynn lied to the FBI but didn\'t fire him, then later admitted to this obstruction of justice through a tweet (moron).  Trump Jr had direct communications with wikileaks, a proxy for Russia.  KT McFarland, Trumps transition advisor, said in an email to reassure Russia about sanctions because they threw the election to Trump. 30+ years of Trump being involved with Russian money.

'Oh boy! OK, let\'s look at another investigation that involved conspiracy against the United States, a looong investigation, and also required investigating many underlings for related charges before the "top dogs" were eventually convicted: the Enron scandal.\n\nThe Mueller investigation has been ongoing for a bit over 7 months. It has already secured guilty pleas from prominent figures Papadopoulos and Flynn, and has arrested Manafort under charges deemed credible by a US justice. That\'s a lot more than the Enron scandal had achieved at this point.\n\nFrom the date that the inquiry was launched into Enron in 2001, it took NINE MONTHS for just ONE conviction of Obstruction of Justice that was later overturned by the Supreme Court. The first major indictment that stuck was issued in 2003. And it took a 6-year investigation from 2001 to 2007, peppered with indictments of underlings, until Enron executives were finally convicted and sentenced. It was a 6 year investigation, and it is now one of the most famous, well-studied, and successful conspiracy investigations in US history.\n\nTL;DR: Some important investigations take years to see results. Be patient. Mueller is coming  :)'

"Disclaimer: I am in no way a Trump supporter and will be the first to cheer when he inevitably goes down, but...\n\nHonest question: [I remember reading the story of the woman who wore a spaghetti strainer on her head for her drivers license picture who claimed that it should be allowed because it followed her religious beliefs. She ended up winning the case.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/11/16/church-flying-spaghetti-monster-massachusetts-religion/75862946/) Between something like that and [The Church of Scientology being recognized as an official religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology_status_by_country), how does this MAGA guy differ? \n\nPeople wear political clothing all the time, which in my opinion is generally a good thing. Before the election I saw more Hillary and Bernie shirts than any other politician I've ever seen. Would it still be okay to kick all those people out of whatever establishment they wanted to go in? I'm a big Bernie guy, if my employer found out and happened to be a Trump supporter could I be fired? \n\nTo me, this sets a dangerous precedent going forward and is more harmful than helpful. \n\n"
'I mean ... I kind of agree with the guy.\n\n>Religions are shared collections of transcendental beliefs that have been passed on from believers to converts, that are held by adherents to be actively meaningful and serious and either based on (1) formally documented doctrine (organized religion) or (2) established cultural practices (folk religion). In both forms, there are religious professionals who embody formal aspects of the religion and who act in positions of leadership and governance, and there are certain rituals reserved for them to carry out. The beliefs generate practical implications for how life should be lived.\n\n>Religions often include: spiritual explanations of our place in the world in an attempt to answer questions about "why we are here"; worship of deities and/or supernatural entities (including ancestors); conceptions of "holy" and "sacred" activities ideas and objects; set rituals, calendar events based on the changing seasons, distinctive dress codes (especially for religious professionals), codes of morality and action that are given a mandate from a supernaturally great being, from a supernatural force or from the will of the Universe itself; and, a caste of privileged and exalted professionals who have particular claims to be in touch with transcendental forces.\n\nEDIT:  Downvotes without response?  Look, I am one of you.  Donald has to go.  His followers are absurd.  However, there is a larger discussion to be had about what *is* and *is not* a religion.  '
'(Not a lawyer.)  \n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe law differs on whether it is a private business or a government entity. (The government is basically not allowed to do this because of the constitution - freedom of speech/assemble.  \n&nbsp;\n\nThe legal term for treating people differently is to "discriminate".  It\'s a negative term when associated with racism/sexism/etc, but it just describes differences in treatment. An employer discriminates when he gives one employee a raise for stellar work and doesn\'t give that raise to everyone. A business discriminates when giving lunch specials or volume pricing.  \n&nbsp;\n\nWith a private business (or an individual person), they have the right to treat different people differently  for any reason provided they aren\'t doing it based on one of several "protected classes" - e.g race, religion, sex and others. (Some classes are only protected on a State level by individual State laws- sexual orientation is the most visible one.)  \n&nbsp;\n\nPolitical party or political beliefs are not protected classes.  \n&nbsp;\n\n\nEmployers can fire people for their political beliefs (at least in most areas as would be "at will" employees).  \n&nbsp;  \n\nThe precedent is not being set here. It is long established. There is a balance between infringing on the behavior of individuals and businesses and protecting the rights of people being excluded for the political beliefs. If this became a significant problem, the state/federal solution would be to create political belief to be a protected class (as was done for race, sex and religion). Given that this isn\'t a routine or widespread issue, that isn\'t about to happen.   \n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe counter argument would be - would you want to prohibit a Jewish owned restaurant from being able to kick out a group of customers in full Nazi regalia?  Does a Trump Hotel have the legal right to refuse Stormy Daniel from doing a press conference from a hotel ballroom if she wants to rent it for the day? Can a landscaper refuse to take the job to tend the grounds of the KKK headquarters?'
'Black people are a protected class, Trump supporters are not. '
'I don\'t know if that\'s fair, because even though it appears to us that the majority of his supporters suffer most in relation to his policy decisions while being sold on the idea they\'re being helped, I don\'t think calling it a cult is constructive. \n\nAlso, "one person\'s freedom fighter is another\'s terrorist" sort of idea applies to the hate group aspect. I think that the best approach is to empathise, seek to understand, and respect them as fellow human beings. I think that the best way to approach someone\'s *faith* without encroaching is to be loving towards them. That doesn\'t entail skirting around topics or tip toeing, it just means not labelling them, leveling with them as a human, not categorizing or disregarding them as being part of a cult or hate group, that will only incite an emotional/ego based kneejerk reactionary response based on their association with those two terms.\n\nI believe that both cults and hate groups are born from the same emotion: **fear**'
'>... if it included anything that a sufficient number of people were especially enthusiastic about.\n\nI don\'t think that is the case here, because to me it seems like many of whom I\'ve encountered are re-allocating *faith* to him. Their support of him typically is rooted in that, which is hard to argue with, and quickly devolves into name-calling and general breaks in communication. \n\nI agree with you, as do many scholars on the legal definition of "religion" but it\'s been evolving ever since that amendment was put on paper. Check out "Defining Religion in the First Amendment: a Functional Approach" from Cornell University. I just read through it, pretty interesting. \n\nThe conclusion is distinctly different from Trump support, but I wanted to offer my perspective to show how this person might think of it like a religion.  The main difference in my opinion being that belief in him is not existential to the self, but to the ego.'
"Black people could theoretically support David Duke, but they can not un-choose their blackness. \n\nSo yes it's totally ok to bar someone for their political support, but it's not ok to bar someone for who or what they are"
'To many at this point the MAGA hat is representative of some pretty repulsive viewpoints. Those that wear them are usually doing it for the same reason someone might wear a shirt that says "fuck you you fucking fuck" but worse because the underlying message is deeper.\n\nIt\'s kind of like when Richard Spencer attempts to soften public perceptions of NAZI/KKK ideology by changing the labeling involved, the looks involved, even the language involved in order to penetrate the mainstream and draw support or influence the easily influenced. \n\nI\'m not saying all people who wear MAGA hats are white nationalists seeking an ethno-state for whites only but they do share a common thread with those people and don\'t make any attempts to distance themselves from it and that is pretty telling.'

"I'm not an expert on uranium, so I was hoping you could help me make sense of some things. \n\nFor instance, why wouldn't Canada just sell their own uranium? They're one of the world's two leading producers anyway, along with Kazakhstan. \n\nI've even read that Canada might actually be number one in terms of overall production potential, and it seems that Canadian uranium production is probably the primary basis of the US and Canada's strategic alliance going back to the Cold War (the US needed to build those nukes somehow). The United States, on the other hand, is number nine in uranium production, just behind China and just ahead of Ukraine. \n\nBut Russia, which number five in uranium production, apparently needs to import uranium from a country which is only *number nine* in uranium production? Is that right?\n\nLike I said, I'm not an expert on uranium, but I thought you might be able to help me make sense of all of this."

The Clintons will probably never be prosecuted for the crimes they commited just like Trump will probably never be prosecuted for the crimes he didn't commit. "
"I will admit that the following part sounds bad:\n\n>Mr. Christensen, 65, noted that despite assurances by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that uranium could not leave the country without Uranium One or ARMZ obtaining an export license — which they do not have — yellowcake from his property was routinely packed into drums and trucked off to a processing plant in Canada.\n\n>Asked about that, the commission confirmed that Uranium One has, in fact, shipped yellowcake to Canada even though it does not have an export license. Instead, the transport company doing the shipping, RSB Logistic Services, has the license. A commission spokesman said that “to the best of our knowledge” most of the uranium sent to Canada for processing was returned for use in the United States. A Uranium One spokeswoman, Donna Wichers, said 25 percent had gone to Western Europe and Japan. At the moment, with the uranium market in a downturn, nothing is being shipped from the Wyoming mines.\n\nHowever, it also sounds like it's a long way from Russia *literally having control* of 20% of the United States' uranium supply, since it still seems like the vast majority of the uranium being mined by Uranium One inside the US is also being sold inside the US, and like US energy producers and and other American consumers of uranium still have an open market in which to shop around for their uranium. In other words, they have more choices than to shop at Rosatom-owned Uranium One, and thus get charged whatever price that Uranium One thinks is fair.\n\nAlso, I suppose that a lot of people probably assume that each country's uranium production is strictly nationalized or something, with uranium being a strategic resource, and if a person delves into this controversy while carrying that particular assumption with them, than the notion of 'losing 20% of our uranium to Russia' sounds all the worse. \n\nHowever, just doing a bit of reading about it, the uranium business seems like it's actually a lot more open and commercial than most people would assume, and like the term 'uranium supply' really refers to that of the entire world -- not just that of a single country -- with uranium pretty much being just another globally-traded commodity which has producers, sellers, buyers, distribution chains, fluctuations in price, et cetera.\n\nTo be sure, none of the Uranium One stuff *sounds* particularly good, and it looks like it was a bad decision in hindsight, even if just because of the optics that it ended up generating. If -- in some alternate universe -- *I* had been the one making the decision, I suppose that like most people, I would have said no to it. However, relations between the US and Russia were not as icy then as they are now, and the whole deal was apparently part of a rather broadly-supported effort (however ill-advised) to warm them up (with that dumb 'reset button' and all of that).\n\nAlso, in order for there to be a quid pro quo between the Clintons and contributors to their foundation who owned shares of such-and-such company, don't some things having to do with the timeline (specifically the times at which such-and-such people sold off their stakes in such-and-such company) need to be a bit different? Also, doesn't it also fail to explain the willingness of the other cabinet department heads to to sign off on the sale? \n\nI'm trying to keep an open mind about it, but I'm failing to be completely convinced that what Hillary Clinton (along with her husband) did here makes her a traitor to her nation. A mediocre states-person, sure, but not a traitor to her nation."

Soon they won\'t be able to pass anything and they will go back to being the obstructionist opposition party. \n\nThe real question is whether the Democrats can use Trump\'s unpopularity and the GOP\'s moral bankruptcy to peel off enough GOP voters to enable them to take and hold a majority in the House and Senate.

'Robert Swan Mueller III (born August 7, 1944) is an American lawyer and civil servant who was the sixth Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 2001 to 2013.

"I told people before the election that trump was going to win. Nobody in my circle believed it was possible. In fact most people (including trump) thought he was going to lose.

Trumps opponents are totally ineffectual against what he is and what he represents. I want more than anything to be wrong about these things but I doubt things are going to get much better anytime soon. Trump will most likely be reelected in 2020. It's time to wake up to reality.

"The Constitution states pretty clearly that the Presidential Pardon can't be used in matters of impeachment.  Dems have had various articles of impeachment on the floor for a few months now.

Those are two separate sentences; at least, put a semicolon between them. See how I did that?

Maybe you don\'t know what those words mean, but endearing means "inspiring affection" and pensive means "reflecting deep or serious thought."

'If Trump wins it will be because the GOP is actively working to limit voting rights and reduce the number of people who vote.'
'**Evangelicalism**\n\nEvangelicalism (), evangelical Christianity, or evangelical Protestantism, is a worldwide, crossdenominational movement within Protestant Christianity which maintains the belief that the essence of the Gospel consists of the doctrine of salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ\'s atonement. Evangelicals believe in the centrality of the conversion or the "born again" experience in receiving salvation, in the authority of the Bible as God\'s revelation to humanity, and in spreading the Christian message. The movement has had a long presence in the Anglosphere before spreading further afield in the 19th, 20th and early 21st centuries.\n\nIts origins are usually traced to 1738, with various theological streams contributing to its foundation, including English Methodism, the Moravian Church (in particular its bishop Nicolaus Zinzendorf and his community at Herrnhut), and German Lutheran Pietism.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

'Let me judge you as an individual here and now:\n\nYou are obviously too stupid to realize you just practiced what you blamed others for. \n\nPersonally, I do hold groups to account, or in other words, I judge, and I\'ll go further and readily call anyone a liar who says or implies they do not judge.  It\'s human nature for one, and secondly, it is important for recognizing failures and fixing them.  Typically the people who lambast others for judging groups are the ones being judged currently and not liking the result while also seeing truth in it which leaves them impotent with a rebuttal of their own.  In short:  they can only blame the messenger.  They go the intellectually lazy route...\n\nLet me judge Christian Conservatives while we are at it:\n\nAs individuals I think they are some of the finest people.  One\'s who do their best for others and really do give of themselves.  I can say that for many individuals from other groups as well though. \n\nAs a collective however, they are assholes.\n\nThey show how impotent their god is everytime they try to codify into law what their god and message can\'t do alone.  That is anything from discriminating against homosexuals to blue laws like not selling alcohol while Sunday Mass is happening.  To them freedom means, "you are free to be exactly how I want you to be."  THAT makes a group assholes!\n\nSecondly, they hold a distorted, and growing currently, sense of humanity insofar as it being evil.  The math works as follows:\n\nA family has a loving grandfather who is diagnosed with Stage 3 Cancer of some form.  He is healed of his condition.  \n\nThe family MEANS WELL, they hold good intention when they thank their god privately and publicly.  They mean no harm and are just genuinely thankful to their god.  \n\nThey also mean no harm when they do little to nothing to publicly thank the doctors and nurses who performed the surgery and administered care.  Meant no harm when they failed to thank publicly the many thousands, possibly millions of accumulated hours of research that went into finding treatments and cures for only that particular form of cancer.  Meant zero harm when they failed to thank the labor that went into constructing, managing, and directing the institutions that gave care and performed research. \n\nThey gave, publicly, all the praise and thanks to their god. \n\nThat would be alright!  However, they don\'t hate their god when things go wrong.  Instead they hate mankind. \n\nSo their worldview grows distorted when they thank their god where others can hear it for all the good we see, and then blame man for all the bad we see without at least a proportional amount of good we see credited to mankind as well. \n\nNothing accomplishes this better than a congregation of people, meaning no harm, doing this over and over; a church. \n\nThis is a truly evil philosophy.  It\'s manipulative.  It lifts up the church when it did nothing without lifting up those institutions which did everything.  "To God give all the glory" is detrimental to mankind for the sake of the church, the same church that demands you practice this. \n\nThe Church has managed to find a way to take all of the praise, without all of the pomp and stance, by gaining it vicariously through a book it chooses too. \n\nSo evil...'

'> The poll, released Friday, finds that just more than half of those surveyed, 53 percent, say that the special counsel probe is a "fair" investigation into Trump\'s campaign, while 28 percent say it is "unfair." This marks an increase from 48 percent who said the investigation was "fair" in the same poll last month.\n> \n> In addition, respondents said they are more likely to trust Mueller than Trump. Given an option between the two, 55 percent said they would believe Mueller over Trump, compared to 30 percent that said the reverse.\n> \n> Most Americans still have a positive view of the FBI despite weeks of attacks from Trump and congressional Republicans over the bureau\'s handling of both the Russia investigation and the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\'s private email server, the poll finds.\n> \n> Seventy-one percent of Americans said the bureau was just trying to do its job, compared to 23 percent who told the poll they believe the FBI is biased against the president.\n\nWould like to see those numbers of support for Mueller a little higher, but I\'m still glad that it looks like all of Trump\'s bluster and rage is serving mostly to push average Americans away from him.'

"I trust Mueller and think he knows best but I really hope he doesn't jump the gun on this one. Once the indictments drop his initial hand will be revealed and it might be harder to work his way up the chain. I'd personally rather have him wait until Spring and make sure everything is 100% solid."
"I am pretty sure that Mueller et al are going to wait for the time that they deem appropriate.  They know far better than you or I or any other person when the best time to initiate their moves.  Unlike the Trump's, Mueller actually is playing a very calculated game of chess and isn't just going to fumble his way from one day to the next"

'If you\'re actually interested, [this is how a former CIA officer breaks down what you\'re calling \'a piss dossier\':](https://www.justsecurity.org/44697/steele-dossier-knowing/)\n\n>  In this special Just Security article, highly respected former member of the CIA’s Senior Intelligence Service, John Sipher examines the Steele dossier using methods that an intelligence officer would to try to validate such information. Sipher concludes that the dossier’s information on campaign collusion is **generally credible** when measured against standard Russian intelligence practices, events subsequent to Steele’s reporting, and information that has become available in the nine months since Steele’s final report. The dossier, in Sipher’s view, is not without fault, including factual inaccuracies. Those errors, however, do not detract from an overarching framework that has proven to be ever more reliable as new revelations about potential Trump campaign collusion with the Kremlin and its affiliates has come to light in the nine months since Steele submitted his final report.\n\nThe "pee tape" part is meaningless.  It\'s the rest of what well-placed Russians told Steele they understand the FSB has on Trump that is important.\n\nThe simple fact that Steele himself took his reports to US law enforcement is a hell of a statement that he has high confidence in his sources and what they have told him.'

"Here is the thing: The President can (possibly) pardon himself because the Constitution does not explicitly state he can't. \n\nHowever.\n\nPeople use this exclusionary rule as evidence that the President cannot be indicted. Because the Constitution mentions impeachment, but does not explicitly state whether or not impeachment is the only process by which to initiate judicial action against the President.\n\nIn other words. If either of the above situations plays out, it's going to the fucking Supreme Court. This is an insane time to be alive."

"We do know that accepting a pardon means admitting guilt, though, as well as your ability to plead the fifth. Even if New York's double jeopardy law doesn't get fixed, I'd imagine thre's a way to stagger the charges between federal and state such that Trump pardoning himself of one thing federally would lead to him being unable to plead the fifth on a New York charge that he essentially admitted to by pardoning himself on the federal charge."

"LOL This is funny--because he trusted the intelligence community when it came to WMDs.\n\nBut let's bash Trump for not buying 100% of what the IC tells him. SMH."
"Another tired Trump supporter talking point. The intelligence community presented the Bush Administration with the intelligence they had, they did not force Cheney/Rumsfeld/Wolfowitz et al. to publicly misrepresent the intelligence community's findings regarding the supposed WMD program and even shakier supposed ties between Hussein and Bin Laden. I'm not saying the intelligence was spot-on, but the Bush White House used flawed intelligence to mislead because they wanted war, rather than the Administration themselves being misled by flawed intelligence.

"The hero worship is just for fun, and for trolling the Trumpsters. It's silly and fun. I have no problem with that. I don't take it seriously, and from what I can tell, the vast majority of people here don't either.\n\nIt's just - if we're going to post news, let's make sure it's accurate and not fake news. Speculation has a time and place, and this example in the Palmer Report is presented as factual, not speculation. That's my problem with it.

Kander (who is a War Vet) never stood a chance once they tarnished him "brand Hillary".. \nGuess who walked Trump out to be inaugurated in January.. Yep, Sen. Roy "Good ole Boy" Blunt! 😒'
"I agree the hero worship is mostly for fun, but it goes hand in hand with the mentality that allows articles like this to get posted. \n\nI would ask everyone to just pause for a moment and think a bit more critically.

'Agreed, but the post I was responding to was referencing the ineptitude of Democrats to play politics, so I needed to force it to make the joke work. '

"Well, there are various types of shredders, the more secure the more they cost.  Both cross shredders and shredders that reduce to dust are way more secure than the standard vertical-shredding cheapos that I'm sure Cohen's office was using."
"Yeah. I think it'll make at least most of them burned instead of just the top of it at best.\n\nThat being said, it's Cohen. He's too stupid and cheap to buy even cross-cut shredders.

'**Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections**\n\nThe Russian government interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election in order to increase political instability in the United States and to damage Hillary Clinton\'s presidential campaign by bolstering the candidacies of Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein. A January 2017 assessment by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) stated that Russian leadership favored presidential candidate Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, and that Russian president Vladimir Putin personally ordered an "influence campaign" to harm Clinton\'s electoral chances and "undermine public faith in the US democratic process."On October 7, 2016, the ODNI and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) jointly stated that the U.S. Intelligence Community was confident that the Russian Government directed recent hacking of e-mails with the intention of interfering with the U.S. election process. According to the ODNI′s January 6, 2017 report, the Russian military intelligence service (GRU) had hacked the servers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the personal Google email account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and forwarded their contents to WikiLeaks. Although Russian officials have repeatedly denied involvement in any DNC hacks or leaks, there is strong forensic evidence linking the DNC breach to known Russian operations.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

"Not OP but it's pretty well-known that Mueller was the director of the FBI during the Enron investigation and spearheaded this investigation. That's probably the first accomplishment people tend to list for him."
"Sure can.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/13/opinion/robert-mueller-enron-russia-investigation.html\n\n>In December 2001, Enron filed what was then the largest corporate bankruptcy in American history. Just weeks later, Mr. Mueller, then the F.B.I. director; Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson; and the assistant attorney general for the criminal division, Michael Chertoff, formed the Enron Task Force, an elite team of F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors assigned to investigate and prosecute crimes related to the Houston-based energy trader. Andrew Weissmann, who recently joined Mr. Mueller’s Russia team, later led the task force.\n\n[...]\n\n>The Enron team got off to an auspicious start, with the Department of Justice providing adequate prosecutorial resources. Mr. Mueller helped recruit talented prosecutors and investigators from around the country and then got out of their way.\n\n>He and other top Justice Department officials then gave their team political cover. Enron and its executives were particularly close to the Bush family and top Republican officials. Early on, the team interviewed White House officials about their recollections. Republican political operatives voiced displeasure, but the team persisted.\n\n>The task force conducted its investigations effectively, flipping lower-level employees to build cases against the top bad actors. The Enron team made aggressive and risky moves. For example, it shocked Houston high society by charging the wife of Andrew Fastow, the chief financial officer, with tax evasion to put pressure on him. It worked. Mr. Fastow began to cooperate with the government. (His wife pleaded guilty.) Every prosecutor knows this strategy works, but for various reasons today, few put in the painstaking work needed to penetrate the sophisticated legal defenses of highly paid executives.\n\nThe last paragraph is exactly the strategy that the current special counsel is employing in regards to the Russia investigation. Obviously there haven't been any wives charged (yet) but I wouldn't be surprised if Mueller targeted family members who were complicit in these crimes."
"He was a great Tillerson, but even as he did that I still thought he looked more like Bannon.  But I still stand by Galifianakis as the perfect Bannon.  I think he'd knock it outta the park.

">Being the director doesn't inherently require their involvement in big cases.\n\nYou're right, but it's pretty commonly reported that he was deeply involved."
"It doesn't poll well.  From what I've heard, this is a losing strategy.  If democrats make it about impeachment, they lose.  If they make it about healthcare, education and the economy, they win.  People what to hear about what were for, not what were against.  \n\nWhich I understand to a point.  The Russia investigation and all of the other scandals don't affect my day to day life.  But, affordable healthcare and college does.  However, it will affect my day to day life in the future if we allow this level of corruption to continue.

'"Microtargeting" of content is really interesting. Because [Robert Mercer](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/27/the-reclusive-hedge-fund-tycoon-behind-the-trump-presidency), the billionaire hedgefund guy behind Trump, is the main investor in Cambridge Analytica - a company that specializes in exactly that. It\'s parent company is [SCL Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica) (Strategic Communication Laboratories) which has been described as a "global election management agency" known for involvement "in military disinformation campaigns to social media branding and voter targeting". In short, **they specialize in military propaganda or ‘psyops’**. \n\n*Cambridge Analytica* was brought in by Mercer to help Trump win. \n\n>Cambridge Analytica:  The company claims to use “data enhancement and audience segmentation techniques” providing “psychographic analysis” for a “deeper knowledge of the target audience”. The company uses the OCEAN scale of personality traits. Using what it calls **"behavioral microtargeting"** the company indicates that it can predict "needs" of subjects and how these needs may change over time. Services then can be individually targeted for the benefit of its clients from the political arena, governments, and companies providing "a better and more actionable view of their key audiences." \n\nCombining data and content obtained through nefarious means (hacking) with sophisticated software and targeting to maximize its effectiveness is evil genius. All the pieces are coming together now. What is becoming much clearer now is that Trump\'s victory was no bumbling accident. \n\nInterestingly, Cambridge Analytica\'s software is based on models developed by Cambridge academic Michal Kosinski - he didn\'t want to have anything to do with the company. The guy that first approached Kosinski was Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian. It was Kogan that apparently introduced SCL to Kosinki\'s models. Kogan then moved to Singapore and changed his name to [Alexander Spectre](http://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/people/ak823@cam.ac.uk). Was he working for Russian Intelligence? **Given the key role Cambridge Analytica and SCL played in the US election (and in Brexit), it would be good to know who exactly is behind them.** \n\n> Who exactly owns SCL and its diverse branches is unclear, thanks to a convoluted corporate structure, the type seen in the UK Companies House, the Panama Papers, and the Delaware company registry. Some of the SCL offshoots have been involved in elections from Ukraine to Nigeria, helped the Nepalese monarch against the rebels, whereas others have developed methods to influence Eastern European and Afghan citizens for NATO. And, in 2013, SCL spun off a new company to participate in US elections: Cambridge Analytica.\n\nIt gets more interesting. The largest shareholder of SCL was on record as being Vincent Tchenguiz, an Iranian-British businessman.  Tchenguiz is a business partner with Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash,  who is known as a Putin protégé. Tchenguiz used the same Guernsey holding company, Wheddon Ltd., to invest both in Cambridge Analytica’s parent company and in another privately held U.K. business whose largest shareholder was the Ukrainian gas middleman [Dmitry Firtash](http://www.reuters.com/article/russia-capitalism-gas-special-report-pix-idUSL3N0TF4QD20141126) - a close friend of Putin who is [currently indicted](http://abc7chicago.com/news/ukrainian-oligarchs-extradition-to-chicago-on-hold/1768041/) and awaiting extradition on corruption and racketeering charges.\n\n> Over the same time period, other documents show, bankers close to Putin granted Firtash credit lines of up to $11 billion. That credit helped Firtash, who backed pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovich\'s successful 2010 bid to become Ukraine\'s president, to buy a dominant position in the country\'s chemical and fertiliser industry and expand his influence.\n\nAnd guess who was Dmitry Firtash\'s former business partner? [Paul Manafort](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-campaign-chief-paul-manafort-named-in-ukraine-anti-corruption-probe/2016/08/15/fa180f20-6327-11e6-be4e-23fc4d4d12b4_story.html) - Trump\'s former campaign manager. Manafort of course worked directly for Yanukovych and [Firtash](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/21/austria-grants-us-request-to-extradite-ukrainian-mogul-dmytro-firtash) was the middleman between Putin and the Yanukovych electoral operation in Ukraine.\n\nSo the largest shareholder of Cambridge Analytica is a business partner with Firtash, who has direct ties with Putin. Firtash is known to operate as a financing middleman for Putin\'s foreign policy "operations". Could SCL, parent of CA, be a front for a Russian Intelligence operation? If you think about it, SCL specializes in new sophisticated technology models for military propaganda. If you read up on new Russian military doctrine, it\'s clear they are placing a big emphasis on information warfare. The [\'Gerasimov Doctrine’](https://inmoscowsshadows.wordpress.com/2014/07/06/the-gerasimov-doctrine-and-russian-non-linear-war/) is quite insightful about how Russia views defeating their enemies:\n\n> The role of nonmilitary means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown, and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their effectiveness....All this is supplemented by military means of a concealed character, including carrying out actions of informational conflict.\n\n> Among such actions are the use of special-operations forces and *internal opposition* to create a permanently operating front through the entire territory of the enemy state, as well as informational actions, devices, and means that are constantly being perfected.\n\nDid Russia view Bannon/Trump and co as the perfect vehicles to ferment and support "internal opposition"? Was Cambridge Analytica one of the vehicles to achieve this and to help execute their ideas around information warfare?\n\nGuess who a Board Member of Cambridge Analytica was? **Steve Bannon.** And it was Robert Mercer that [bankrolled Steve Bannon](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/robert-mercer-breitbart-war-on-media-steve-bannon-donald-trump-nigel-farage) and Breitbart to the tune of $10 million - no doubt to be the front-facing tool to execute on their ideas around influence, manipulation and propaganda. \n\nAnd with the help of Russian Intelligence, it is entirely plausible Breitbart was involved in using bots and social media to help propagate news they knew would damage Hillary and help Trump. \n\nThere are very clear and direct ties between powerful Russian/Ukrainian figures and Cambridge Analytica - which specializes in military propaganda. Steve Bannon was a board member and Robert Mercer was its biggest investor. And of course Mercer, Banner, Cambridge Analytica and Brieitbart all played a key roll in helping Trump get elected. It\'s not a big stretch to suggest that there was cooperation and collusion with Russian Intelligence, who provided hacked data to Cambridge Analytica, who then used it to carry out a sophisticated propaganda campaign, with Breitbart as the lead. \n\n[Cambridge Analytica also played a key role in BREXIT - offering Firage and the Leave campaign their services *for free*](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/robert-mercer-brexit-nigel-farage-donald-trump-breitbart-facebook-advertisement-cambridge-analytica-a7600041.html). \n\n>The firm is said to have advised Leave.eu by harvesting data from people\'s Facebook profiles to decide how to target them with individualised advertisements.  \n\n\nBrexit was of course seen as a big geopolitical strategic win for Putin and Russia.\n\nAnother interesting bit of info that is a bit tenuous but nonetheless intriguing - the largest shareholder of SCL Group was Vincent Tchenguiz. \n\n> In March 2011 the Tchenguiz brothers were arrested in dramatic predawn raids as part of an investigation into the 2008 collapse of the Icelandic bank Kaupthing. Just before its collapse, Kaupthing’s loans to the Tchenguiz brothers totaled 40 percent of its capital. It has been charged that Kaupthing—which had a far-from-transparent ownership structure—was effectively the Tchenguiz brothers’ bank and that they looted the bank, leading to its collapse.\n\n> Kaupthing’s largest shareholder, Meidur, now called Exista, which owned 25 percent of its shares, [had ties to Alfa Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exista), the largest Russian commercial bank; Alfa chairman was “deep state” figure Mikhail Fridman, chairman and co-founder of Alfa Group, the parent of Alfa Bank. Meanwhile, Trump adviser Richard Burt (who also was being paid by Russia to promote a Gazprom pipeline) is on the “senior advisory board” of Alfa Bank. \n\nWas this how Russian intelligence bankrolled SCL in the early days? Perhaps Vincent Tchenguiz was the cutout man, and funds were channeled from Alfa Bank into Kaupthing and on to Vincent Tchenguiz. Russian Intelligence seems to work well with ambitious businessman who are happy to be corrupted if they can make some money. Trump also seemed to fit this bill. \n\n*Alfa Bank was the bank that a Trump Server was mysteriously communicating with and was likely the subject of an FBI surveillance warrant.*  '
'It\'s important to understand the specific nature of legal wording/phrasing.\n\nWhere the language of a Mueller indictment might say the "voting outcome" was not affected by the hacks is to say that the hackers did not alter voting records. This is correct.\n\nHowever, this purposely doesn\'t comment on the indirect effect that entities, including but not limited to the GRU, had on influencing the actual voting outcome.\n\nThere are several reasons to make this distinction, but the legal reason for it is to avoid hanging a legal argument on tenuous threads.  Each of Mueller\'s indictments is compartmented, narrow, specific.... so as to increase the likelihood of securing the Grand Jury conviction.  The FBI has a near 100&#37; conviction rate and they like to keep it that way.  And to that point, the charges made are Conspiracy to Defraud the U.S. (18 USC §371), computer fraud (18 USC §1030), and aggravated identity theft (18 USC §1028A).\n\nAnother consideration reinforced by the legal analysts at Lawfareblog: There is almost no likelihood of extradition for the 12 GRU officers... they will never leave Russia or be extradited by Russia to the U.S.  So, the purpose of the indictment, other than laying groundwork for other indictments and freezing Russian assets in the United States, is to let the American people know.  And in that sense, every word or phrase is chosen carefully.\n\nThe indictment clearly tells us that the vote counts were not changed (which is, again, completely correct), but it clearly excludes any kind of conclusion that the actual votes made were not *influenced*... that was the entire intent of the Russian effort from paragraph one of the indictment.'

'First a positive: you have a fantastic username from a tremendous movie. But you mention some facts, so I\'ll counter your statements with some additional ones. \n\n1. First, this isn\'t an indictment, it\'s a statement of offense. And these aren\'t \'charges\', Papadapoulos signed a plea deal for a single \'violation\', false statements. Are the three \'charges\' you are referring to different incidents of communicating with Russians? This implicates himself and himself only. Because collusion... (continued)\n\n2. ...isn\'t actually a crime (except in antitrust). That\'s why he didn\'t sign a plea deal for collusion, he signed one for lying. You can think it\'s shady, and you\'re entitled to. You can think the same about Donald Junior for taking a meeting with somebody claiming to rep the Russian Govt and having dirt on Hillary. But the bottom line is that communicating with other countries and seeking \'opposition research\' isn\'t illegal and is standard practice in US political campaigns. It happened on both sides in this election, and I can provide examples if you\'d like. I won\'t go into Hillary\'s current issues, but she did once say "I am already receiving messages from leaders, and I am having foreign leaders ask if they can endorse me to stop Donald Trump". And the US is no stranger to trying to influence foreign elections. There are a number of things that could be actual violations across election law, computer hacking, false statements, and wire fraud, but most are quite separate from collusion. \n\n3. People on both sides have chosen who they support, and hope for the eventual outcome of this, and other topics, to support their side. We\'re all guilty of confirmation bias and seeking validation of our beliefs. And both sides are passionate about their beliefs, and claim the other side doesn\'t doesn\'t believe facts. We all cherry pick the ones that support our views. An informed individual can address the "facts" that both support and counter their views (not meant as a dig, just something for all of us to strive for). \n\nCheers.'

'There is no personality cult for Podesta. People here don\'t give a fuck which party Podesta is part of, if he was breaking the law, then fuck him, we want him punished.\n\nSame thing happened with Weinstein turning out to be a sex offender. The right tried to "checkmate, liberals" but the left wasn\'t in his corner. Nobody gives a fuck that he voted for democrats and gave money to liberal causes. He\'s now considered a criminal, a traitor, a monster, and no one on the left has any excuses to make for him or wants anything to do with him.\n\nAnd that\'s exactly what *will not* happen to Trump on the right. That\'s what we\'re all upset about. It\'s like the right is cheering for a favorite sports team or something, and just wants their guy to win no matter what. It seems most people on the right don\'t mind if their values are upheld or not, they aren\'t worried about the integrity of government officials, they just want Team Red to win, at any and all costs. Otherwise why do they stick up for frauds? The party won\'t end if they take a break to find new leaders. Why not find a new face for their movement? Because it\'s just about "fuck the libtards, look we\'re winning!" No concern for integrity at all.'
'lol i like that '
"lol thanks. You're right half of what I said was speculation and I'll admit I hope Trump goes down hard. I will accept Mueller's results whatever they end up being and I hope others will too."
'Lol. You already have it all figured out but since you asked...\n\nYou probably know that there is no crime called “collusion.” So an example of a crime he could’ve been charged with is:\n\n52 U.S. Code § 30121 - Contributions and donations by foreign nationals\n\n(a) ProhibitionIt shall be unlawful for—\n(1) a foreign national, directly or indirectly, to make—\n(A) a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value, or to make an express or implied promise to make a contribution or donation, in connection with a Federal, State, or local election;\n(B) a contribution or donation to a committee of a political party; or\n(C) an expenditure, independent expenditure, or disbursement for an electioneering communication (within the meaning of section 30104(f)(3) of this title); or\n(2) a person to solicit, accept, or receive a contribution or donation described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) from a foreign national.\n(b) “Foreign national” definedAs used in this section, the term “foreign national” means—\n(1) a foreign principal, as such term is defined by section 611(b) of title 22, except that the term “foreign national” shall not include any individual who is a citizen of the United States; or\n(2) an individual who is not a citizen of the United States or a national of the United States (as defined in section 1101(a)(22) of title 8) and who is not lawfully admitted for permanent residence, as defined by section 1101(a)(20) of title 8.\n\nA key point point to the law above is that SOLICITATION is enough to be a crime. He did not have to actually receive  material.\n\nGeorge solicited valuable information (emails) from a foreign national as well as secretly tried to setup meetings with foreign nationals tied to Russia.\n\nThat is collusion.\n\nStay with me because this is where it gets really bad for you Trump humpers:\n\nGeorge took a plea deal. Which means FBI offered a light sentence in order for his cooperation otherwise known as “flipping” to go after larger suspects.\n\nBombshell: He is listed on court documents as a “proactive cooperator”.....aka an informant.\nT\nHe was charged 3 months ago, that means for the past 3 months his charges have been kept secret and he has been cooperating with Mueller.\n\nI’ll let you make up your own theories on what that means.\n\n'
'100% disagree. I know that the_donald subreddit is bashed no matter what, and that\'s fine. A lot of what you read there is ridiculous. But if you actually read a lot of the posts there (and from a lot of the journalists that like Trump) you\'d see that what you said and what I say are very aligned. Establishment left AND right are bullshit. That is one thing that bernie as well as trump both deserve credit for in 2016. They were the first 2 that stood up to "politics as usual". Granted, bernie got steamrolled by the hillary goliath, but that is where trump is different. I am pretty sure establishment GOP wants trump impeached every bit as much as establishment left, to keep their corrupt system in place. I couldn\'t care less what party they are in, mitch mcconnell, paul ryan, mccain, bush, hillary, obama, they\'re all corrupt to the core. They were brought up in the shitstorm of corruption and played right into it. True outsiders (trump, mark cuban?) have the best chance at destroying it from within. The media and most senior members of both parties will do whatever they can to destroy any outside influence. Trump has a VERY loyal following specifically because his agenda is to "drain the swamp" meaning BOTH parties. I\'m excited to see how 2018 plays out, because the "establishment as usual" GOP crowd is shaking in their boots. Trump could literally say he\'s leaving the GOP today and being an independent candidate and he\'d have at least 50% of the GOP follow him regardless of party affiliation. Ever since the election when I saw how dirty the GOP is there\'s no chance in hell I will ever give the GOP another dime of my money. The left and right will bash each other in front of the camera, but it is all bullshit. Establishment vs. Outsiders/independents are what the future of elections are going to be. We\'re very likely to see a legit contender in 2020 that is socially liberal (within reason) and fiscally conservative AND not part of the washington corruption, and have them win the presidency. Young people are not like our parents. We aren\'t just going to put on CNN or Fox every day and blindly follow whatever we hear. People do their own research now and actually understand politics. I\'d say there are about 25% of people that are so far left on this site that they wouldn\'t even entertain a conversation related to somoene else\'s belief systems and call me a "cheeto or trumpster or drumpf, etc" and 25% of the right do the same "snowflake, libtard, etc." but there are a reasonable amount of people that can have a good conversation about politics and make for an interesting conversation. Once you sift through the muck that is biased media and actually read the facts on your own (like the 12 indictments), I for one generally say "interesting, that is definitely not what i heard on CNN or fox" and just draw my own conclusions. \n\nIf you\'re a criminal, right or left, you need to be punished for it. nobody would be cheering for manafort and his tax evading, money laundering, shady deal ways no matter who he worked for or what party he aligned himself with.

'Russia stands to gain an absolute shitload in return in the long term.\n\n- Increased division among Americans over political and racial lines, and increased general distrust for politicians and political office.\n\n- The continued dissemination of propaganda and "fake news" over the internet by Russia, as described in the book Foundations of geopolitics by Aleksadr Dugin, acting to increase distrust of mainstream news organisations and leading many people to simply not believe anything those news organisations say.\n\n- America\'s image on the world stage tarnished by having a man from the TV, commonly perceived worldwide as an utter fucking buffoon, elected to the presidency.\n\n- The perception of America being considered weakened (and the clear division, instability, and strife within the country) weakens not only the US on the world stage, but also NATO given that USA is the largest and most powerful country in the organisation. (not to mention Trumps dislike NATO and questioning of USA\'s continued involvement as clearly opined on numerous occasions).\n\n- Russia\'s suspected influence on destabilizing forces within the EU, weakening The EU as an economic and political union, is obviously to Russia\'s benefit as they\'re a massive competitor in the world as well as a neighbouring power.\n\nAll of those factors together, decreases Russia\'s "competition" on the world stage. I mean, Russian has already conquered Abkhasia and South Ossettia in 2008, and part of crimea in 2014. \n\nShould the things predicted in Dugins Foundations of Geopolitics come to pass (and it looks like everything is going more or less as predicted), USA and EU would be too troubled by internal strife possibly intervene in any attempt by Russia to further conquer their way around Europe then Asia in a manner that the soviets could have only wished for.\n\nThe only difference is now the people benefiting from this conquering aren\'t the communist parties, they\'re the Russian Oligarchy (many of whom are suspected of being involved in funding what\'s happening, from trumps campaign, to the destabilizing propaganda being fostered online).\n\nShould this all come to pass Russia will once again be a (or maybe THE) major power on the world stage, and largely dictate world politics for many generations.'
"I dont think trump had anything to do with this particular situation. Perhaps something else sure. But this indictment was mostly pre-2014. But I think its terrible these shady characters were hired and potentially not vetted at all or else this woukd have to come up. I dont think it says he's qualified or not because we dont know the facts yet. Hillary and obama had a potentially very shady uranium deal (with many others involved and other agencies). Including $10 million + going unaccounted for towards fusion GPS. Corrupt? Possibly. Did she know? Possibly. Does it make her unqualified to be president? Not at all. Shes still very qualified to run the country, corrupt or not knowing anything about these dealings at all. \n\nIf a true investigation leads to the oval office and trump is found guilty in a court of law then of course oust him. And I'm a big supporter of his. But when it comes to doing illegal acts its black and white to me. But that has to go both ways. If the uranium one deal goes all the way up to hillary and obama the same rules must apply. Its black and white. Shouldn't be partisan at all. And I hope that if nobody gets in trouble ultimately in high office that going forward both parties are more aware of holding each other accountable. It will ultimately be a win for everyone going forward that more eyes are on these dealings. "
"Lol.  You're funny.  Clinton was impeached for perjury over a blowjob by a Special Counsel investigating a land deal from a decade before.\n\nAnd Ken Starr was nowhere near as competent as Mueller.  The fun with this has just started."
"Forensic analysis of the DNC leaks show they were copied locally to a linux bootable USB stick running ext4 as part of a much larger dataset, then copied to a computer with EST locale set and archived as part of a subset of that data two months later. Like someone was picking what to release. \n \nAll of this is verifiable with timestamps and metadata as part of the original release. If you'd like a magnet link to a SHA256 hash verified copy of the original archive, let me know and I'll send it to you. From there you can follow [the instructions](http://g-2.space/) to validate the metadata yourself. You don't have to believe anyone.\n\nGuccifer 2.0 claimed to access the servers via a security flaw in NGP VAN, but NGP VAN is an SaaS cloud service and sits on a different network than the DNC servers. This would make his claim impossible, and a claim only a person unfamiliar with hacking or computers would present. \n\nIf the DNC servers were actual evidence of an actual crime there would be a chain of custody and independent verification from a law enforcement agency, ANY law enforcement agency. To this day no law enforcement agency has examined the servers or has had physical access to the servers, nor have they been taken into custody as evidence. This means there are no PLANS to ever have them used as evidence. If they are a smoking gun, where are they now? Why would the FBI risk damaging the integrity of their evidence?\n\nI can guarantee you right now, even when armed with data you yourself can validate that will completely disprove the DNC's story, you won't actually go look yourself. Because that's hard and CNN is easy. You'll keep parroting a lie that's been disproven by a number of disparate, independent security researchers because you don't want to learn how NTFS filestamp precision differs from EXT4 or how data size and stamp differentials can show a data transfer rate that excludes offsite duplication.\n\n[Technical details that are readily available, ones you can validate yourself and expose the fraud.](https://theforensicator.wordpress.com/)\n\nIf you would like help in actually reviewing the data, let me know, I do this professionally.\n\n\n"

"This weekend I decided to re-read George Washington's farewell address. He expressly warned us against the very behavior that the Republicans now display.\n\n> The very idea of the power and the right of the people to establish government presupposes the duty of every individual to obey the established government. All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and associations, under whatever plausible character, with the real design to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put, in the place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community [...] \n\n> However combinations or associations of the above description may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time and things, to become **potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.**\n\n[...]\n\n> The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of public liberty.\n\n> Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight), the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\n\n> It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. **It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another.**\n\n[...]\n\n> In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and affectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and lasting impression I could wish; that they will control the usual current of the passions, or prevent our nation from running the course which has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But, if I may even flatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, some occasional good; **that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign intrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism**; this hope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare, by which they have been dictated."

'There must be a motivating factor for Trump to do this after denying it from the start and it is really fun to speculate.  Trump\'s denial of this made no sense from the start but he still proceeded to deny anyway, so what changed?\n\nTo Trump, he likely finds it plausible to deny while acting differently in the courts.  Then he can simply call "FAKE NEWS, MAGA" on any who reports on it.  After denying the affair and by inference he denied the possibility that Stormy Daniels could have any material to to prove this \\- he entered as a damaged party regarding the NDA that Stormy "breached" meaning that there is an admission that at a minimum the facts as stated in the NDA \\(including that Stormy has materials and proof\\) are in fact true and "DD" is indeed Trump.  All the while he still calls it fake news when anyone reports this.\n\nTo have this shift and to publicly claim otherwise in the public \\- something unexpected and very motivating must be in play.  \n\nThe best guess floating around it seems is that it relates to Cohen\'s legal troubles in his criminal suit.  Remember, Cohen claimed to only have a few clients he does "legal work" for.  Cohen is arguing for documents to remain under the protection of client/attorney privilege and that there is a ton of documents that are privileged.  \n\nYet, two of the three clients he claimed to do legal work for have been claiming Cohen barely did any actual legal work for them basically throwing Cohen under a large bus .  How could there be a ton of legal documents that should be protected when 2 out of 3 clients claim that there was basically a minimal amount of legal services from Cohen being provided? \n\nTrump may be trying to assert to the court that Cohen indeed was representing him legally and trying to make the point that indeed there are protected documents \\(if Trump claimed Cohen did nothing legally for him, then Cohen can\'t make a claim of attorney/client privilege\\).  Alternatively, Trump could be doing this in order to stay on Cohen\'s good side.  Who knows how loyal Cohen will be when/if the chips fall?  This could be a self preservation move to help Cohen and in turn hopefully keep his loyalty.'

Especially after having such a good, honorable, noble man like President Obama leading the way for 8 years.

"Yup. Been trying to tell my liberal friends this. They are so confident in Democrats winning the House and Senate in 2018 and then impeaching that they are missing what is going to be a very difficult election.\n\n\n\nThe Democrats have something like 27 Senate seats up for re-election this cycle while Republicans have only about 8. Of those 27 Democrats, **a lot** are in deep red states. Indiana, West Virginia, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota and a whole slew of other states that aren't red, but where Trump won like Wisconsin, Ohio, Florida. On the flip side, the **only** state that Clinton won with a Republican seat up for election is Nevada, which has been trending more and more red in national elections. Obama won Nevada by double digits in 2008, single digits in 2012, and Clinton squeaked out a victory there in 2016.\n\n\n\nEven if the Democrats manage to hold every single seat they currently hold **and** flip **all** of the Republican seats, they would only end up with 56 + 2 independents who usually caucus with Democrats. A 2/3 majority in the Senate is required to convict on impeachment, so 67. Democrats would have to vote completely in unison and get 11 Republicans to vote to remove the President from office for the first time in our country's history, a huge stain on the party.\n\n\n\nImpeachment is not happening. Need to focus on 2020, let Mueller conclude his investigation, and try and win in 2020."
"Best case scenario, 11 R's would have to vote to remove him from office. I don't see that happening, though I sure wouldn't mind it. And yes, voting is extremely important, more so than at any time in my memory. I'm just saying the focus shouldn't be on impeachment as it's a *very* long shot."
"Sometimes the stars align and the despicable Walsh says something I agree with and I start to feel funny all over but also want to take a long shower.\n\nEdit: It's amazing how many people in his replies don't understand what he tweeted."

"One person and he did it to protect the integrity of the investigation while removing a person who was not behaving impartially.  The last laugh will be Mueller's.  He's a dedicated servant to this country and has been for about 5 decades now.  He's the catalyst of sweet bleach justice for this shit stained fat draft dodger conman you call a President."

"Very good points and i agree with you whole heartedly about us having a hand in creating (and hopefully helping to fix) this mess. But he definetely knew let's not pretend he didn't. Just another example of this administration misleading the public. "
'The Middle East is a very complex situation that\'s been around for ages. One man is not going to fix it. What he is doing is just causing more instability in the region. And one more point, even if he was tasked with "fixing the middle east" the way he is going about it ie; behind the backs of the intelligence community and others, is not the way to accomplish peace in the Middle East.'
'Makes me happy too. The nature of this sub is sort of an echo chamber, so this is nice to see. '
'That said, the 20th century order caused much of the instability. Jews, Coptic Christians and Muslims lived side by side for centuries prior to colonialism in places like Palestine (now mostly Isreal) and Egypt. \n\nThe British and French just drew borders on convenience, the British engineered the seething mass that was Mandatory Palestine, and the US used its economic might to force through the UN resolution leading to the State of Israel.\n\nIMO - if we (collective) had a hand in breaking it, we have a certain responsibility to help fix it (productively - not the Kushner way)'
"Always good advice.  Mueller keeps it **CRIMINAL** though, and I'm more than fine with that."
'Absolute not, he knew it was his ass if the truth came out, but you\'re right in that he was so stupid that he fired Comey and actually thought that would end it all and he was safe.\nTrump was a private citizen all his life and did not know thing one about public service and the expectations when given the responsibility. There was little doubt in his mind that he could bring in people to cover his back, like Sen Sessions, who unlike Trump was elected to office and knew the routine. Sessions chose the Sgt Shultz defense of "I see nothing,..nothing" and quickly disentangled himself with a recusal.\n\nNo, trump knew he conspired with those who suggested a covert operation WITH the Russians to help him win and knew there is always a payback.\n\nAnd I am also sure that Trump never envisioned that there would be such a reaction to all this, as this campaign  was just like he did business all these years, made himself wealthy and thought it could all be applied to his new job and work just as well.\n\nHe made a **huge miscalculation** and now the walls are closing in and he thinks some *miraculous* foreign policy achievement, or a massive growth in the economy or a large change in direction of our society would somehow save his ass.\n\nThat is what he thinks and he is dead wrong.'

'only trump can keep digging himself deeper with every daily tweet. it truly is a magnificent show of ignorance on a level of which we have never seen before. '
'He needs to be loved by his fans though. He floats all his ideas to them to see if he will get support. Unless he personally benefits financially, he doesn’t make actual decisions on things. He knows the repercussions of during Sessions and wants to create a situation where he can whip his base into a frenzy demanding for Sessions to be removed and then he is a hero. '
'Sessions is too occupied with fears that the kids will get his Lucky Charms to pay attention to stuff like this.'
'He did and the top response I see to Trump is exactly that. Trump has not taken any punitive action toward Putin or Russia despite repeated warnings from the Intelligence community in a pattern that mirrors the repeated warnings about impending al Qaeda action preceding the World Trade Center attack.'
'Yes why don’t his supporters ask questions like this?'
'The need for enough proof to bring charges in a United States Court of Law, and to get to the hundreds of top people responsible, not just the lowest twelve who took orders.'
"This is all new in the grand scheme of things and the public still doesn't know all that's happened yet, but you best believe anyone staying on the GOP-ship after this is a dirty fucking traitor."
'In a two-party system, you\'re either with the republicans or against them. There\'s no "alternative republican" party with saner right-wing stances to compete with them (obvious Democrat jokes aside), you\'re forced to boil your beliefs down to a single global yes/no statement.\n\nAs as result, there\'s nothing for the "I\'m a republican, *but*" people to actually do, to force the republican party to improve. Not unless they want democrats to win, in which case they have the same problem as the "I\'m a democrat, *but*" people.'
"On the other hand, here in the Netherlands we have many parties representing us. It is not hard to find a party which you support, but the impact is marginal. We have 150 seats and need 76 seats atleast to have a coalition. The problem is, when you have many parties, it may require 2 parties to achieve a coalition of 76+ seats (like we had previously) or now 4 parties.\n\nThe problem? Well, the combination involves four different parties with different views. They all have to make so many comprimises that it didn't really mattet after all who you voted for, as the end result is just a comprised bunch of ideas that are just an average and doesn't result in any real actions. Very little changes and it takes a while for something to change.\n\nBottom line: sure, it is not good to have so little options. But although it might be better to have more options to choose from, it is not the ideal situation. We need to rethink the way our political system is shaped. Have a look at Switzerland for example, where many refenderums are taken and the politicians have a supporting role (i.e. implementing the results of the refenderums) instead of a representative role. There are many forms and there may not be a perfect solution that fits each country, but the current state of the system is not sustainable."

His analysis was also corroborated by other top infosec guys like, Paul Vixie.  '

However, the article says this particular discovery was found by chance...\n\nIn late July, one of these scientists—who asked to be referred to as Tea Leaves, a pseudonym that would protect his relationship with the networks and banks that employ him to sift their data—found what looked like malware emanating from Russia. The destination domain had Trump in its name, which of course attracted Tea Leaves’ attention. But his discovery of the data was pure happenstance—a surprising needle in a large haystack of DNS lookups on his screen. “I have an outlier here that connects to Russia in a strange way,” he wrote in his notes. He couldn’t quite figure it out at first. But what he saw was a bank in Moscow that kept irregularly pinging a server registered to the Trump Organization on Fifth Avenue."\n\nlink to article (which is a year old)\n\nhttp://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html'
'Slate\'s sources apparently had access to DNS logs. The records of DNS lookups aren\'t public, but they\'re not exactly closely-guarded secrets. Here\'s an analogy:\n\nLet\'s say Alice wants to call her friend Bob at work, but she doesn\'t know his extension. Alice does know the number for Carol at the front desk, so she calls and asks for Bob\'s extension. Carol tells Alice the extension, and Alice calls Bob. \n\nNow imagine Carol keeps a notebook containing the number of every outside caller who asks for an employee, which employee they\'re asking for, and the time of the call. Carol never knows if Alice ends up calling Bob or what the two talk about, but she does has a record of Alice asking for Bob\'s extension.\n\nAlfa Bank is Alice. The server associated with Trump is Bob. Carol is the DNS server, and her "notebook" is what Slate\'s sources were looking at. '
"Thanks, Ive read them though.  I think I may ave posted them on here somewhere as well.  I found it to be very interesting because the article quoted several cyber security experts that all believed this was a secret connection for communication between the two organizations.  The experts said that this is the was two servers would be set up for secret communications between two criinal organizations.  I feel as though this, and the dutch intelligience regarding Cozy Bear will be the smoking gun in this whole thing.   My opinion, and Im sure others have thought the same is that the main connection is between cambridge analytica performing the data analysis to determine which people and markets the russian troll farm should focus their mesege.  CA had a satellite office in LA in te same building a Bannon's A/V prodction company.  "
'I dont have any subject matter knowledge, but what I found particulary interesting is that after te NYT\'s began asking questions to the WH, the initial campaign server name was terminated, and a new name was implemented.  \n\n"Four days later, on Sept. 27, the Trump Organization created a new host name, trump1.contact-client.com, which enabled communication to the very same server via a different route. When a new host name is created, the first communication with it is never random. To reach the server after the resetting of the host name, the sender of the first inbound mail has to first learn of the name somehow. It’s simply impossible to randomly reach a renamed server. “That party had to have some kind of outbound message through SMS, phone, or some noninternet channel they used to communicate [the new configuration],” Paul Vixie told me. The first attempt to look up the revised host name came from Alfa Bank. “If this was a public server, we would have seen other traces,” Vixie says. “The only look-ups came from this particular source.”'

'I absolutely appreciate what you\'re trying to achieve here. \n\nHowever, a couple things: \n\n* One, the creation of an alternate conservative reality has been ongoing since the 1960s by my best reading of things. That is, prior to the existence of Fox News. It started with conservative think tanks, spread to public radio, and really culminates with Fox News existence. It\'s the capstone to a massive pyramid of successful media influence. Or, call it what it is: propaganda. But the thing is, *it works*. It has worked for generations now. It isn\'t going anywhere any time soon, unfortunately.\n* Second, there\'s this little thing called [the backfire effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias#backfire_effect). In replicable scientific experiments, it has been shown with consistency that when you throw mountains of contradictory evidence in the face of people that have deeply held beliefs, *they reject the facts and it makes their pre-existing beliefs stronger*. This is only slightly terrifying in its ramifications. [Here](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=backfire+effect) you\'ll find more info about the backfire effect. I really like [this](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2017/01/13/yanss-093-the-neuroscience-of-changing-your-mind/) [series](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2017/01/30/yanss-094-how-motivated-skepticism-strengthens-incorrect-beliefs/) of [podcasts](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2017/02/11/yanss-095-how-to-fight-back-against-the-backfire-effect/) on the [topic](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2018/01/29/yanss-120-the-backfire-effect-part-four/).\n\nSo ... what *can* we do to create the desired change, if we\'ve been divided into tribal camps on the verge of open war with one another? Honestly, if it were easy, it\'d be done already. You\'re right, too much is at stake.  Probably the best thing you can do is not freak out. There\'s a certain part of both the left and the right that just want to get a rise out of the other side. Don\'t give them the pleasure.\n\nWhat I\'ve personally found to be effective is an appeal to a higher power. People on the right are frequently -- but not always -- religious. You don\'t grow up in \'MURICA not knowing the basics of Christianity. In personal interactions, I often just say "that doesn\'t sound very Christian" and leave it at that -- and its worked! Not always or even often, but twice! So, its *possible*.\n\nGood luck friend. I want the world to be different and better too.'
'I think a lot of Republican voters would be shocked, but also afraid. Skipping over a lot of intermediate steps, they think it would be bad of the GOP was out of power for a decade or two. Lots think Democratic policies hurt the country, others may believe there *must* be a right-wing party to counteract a left-wing party. So, find some way to convince them the Democrats would be better, and convince them that because conservative voters will still be around, they will organize under a new, untainted banner.'

"What I feel is very important that doesn't get mentioned a lot is that Fox and right wing media didn't take Bernie seriously and so never really tried to trash him like Hillary. \n\nIf Bernie had gotten the nomination, you would have heard 24/7 how he's a Jewish socialist and possibly a communist. \n\nI think that's why no Democrat has declared for 2020 yet so the GOP can't try to ruin any one candidate yet and do investigations of them. "
"Unfortunately I agree with you. He shined a bright light on what this country wants and needs though. The DNC refused to let it happen.

'If the article is true, and it appears to be true because Don Jr. just tweeted out complete confirmation of everything (again), then this is one of the many smoking guns that are laying around in the Trump/Russia thing.  This proves that the Trump family was coordinating activities with a hostile foreign intelligence service aligned with Russia.  If this is the kind of evidence that Mueller has (it is), then a pretty strong case can be made for crimes such as Conspiracy Against The United States.  Also, from the beginning of all of this, the Intelligence Community has called the Trump/Russia thing "an **ATTACK** on our election".  This is very important, because if the American government perceives this as an act of war (it does), then any Americans that were knowingly involved in that have committed Treason.  So now we apparently have proof that the Trump family has conspired with a foreign power to commit an act of war against the United States.  Nearly the entire Trump family now has to answer for Treason.  At least, that\'s my interpretation of the facts.  Better buckle up and invest in popcorn.'

Shame on you. \n\nIt\'s fucking hilarious that you\'re so ashamed of yourself that you need to believe I voted for Trump. I pointed out an example of how Hillary was corrupt and contemptible, but you just fall back to "career politician" as if it makes it okay. Truly deplorable behavior. \n\nPresidents with no political experience:\nZachary Taylor, Ulysses S. Grant, Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nI don\'t know why you\'re acting like this is unprecedented. Also, Congress has a lot of political experience and almost everyone hates the job they have been doing for the last decade. \n\n>I\'m a free-trade globalist type, so his America first moron rhetoric that plays better based on how poorly educated you are just doesn\'t resonate with me.

"Remember that scene from Downfall how all the Germans are partying even as the Soviet shells are landing nearby? Yeah it's kind of like that"
"Exactly, and it's not naive. I know that if I were accused of something horrible and I truly was innocent I would be pushing for an interview and an opportunity to clear my name. Particularly when words like 'treason' were being thrown around. \n\nAn innocent man will take the first opportunity to clear his name. Trump is not behaving anything like this."
"I never 'left' but I don't hang out there. It's still fun to pop in and challenge their views. "

Seriously.  Who had the bright idea to give unlimited pardon rights to the president?  That’s less pragmatic, and more a sweet fringe benefit of being the big man, which isn’t the intent of our system. \n\nLike firing people investigating you. \n\nLike lying to Congressional panels.  \n\nAll of it. All of this “we have to burn because they got us on a technicality” stuff is bullshit. '
'Whenever you tell yourself that the GOP is doing what they do out of cowardice you enable and excuse their behavior.  They are not supporting Trump out of cowardice.  They are supporting Trump out of *self-interest*.  And really, this is the only thing setting "dangerous precedents" for future presidents, because it is your willingness to pretend that the GOP acts counter to their interests when *this has always been their goal*.\n\nThey are *willingly complicit*, and *heavily invested* in protecting him.  Nobody is holding a gun to their heads, and they do what they do because they believe it will net them more power and more control.  \n\nThey do not refuse to impeach because *they want to but are afraid of what will happen*.  They refuse to impeach because they *have no desire to impeach him and they like what he is doing*.  They prefer a world where their president has unlimited power, because they know that if and when (and believe me, they are heavily counting on "if") a democratic president regains control, they can swing back to pretending to care about democracy and limits on presidential power.  They know they can go back to pretending to be bipartisan hacks at the drop of a hat, and people like you will let them.\n\nThey know this because it is true.  And so long as it is true, we will continue to be fucked.'
'If he pardons himself while in office and is then indicted after his term or after impeachment, he could use the pardon as a defense. \n\nIt’s not a moot point. '
'An indictment isn’t needed here, an impeachment is.  We have about 2 years left for his presidency.  An indictment would be an absolute shit show that would be held up in court for the remainder of his presidency.  An impeachment would remove him from his seat, where he would likely be pardoned by Pence and then run to Twitter 5 minutes later saying see, nothing here no evidence I committed a crime.  Or he would refuse to sign the pardon because he would have to admit guilt and that could be used against him in state charges.  \n\nLiterally, we are in uncharted territory here and anything anyone says is pure speculation.  The DOJ papers, scholarly articles, etc... all means nothing.  Some people think that the President can’t be indicted, but that’s also because it’s never happened.  A lot of people said we couldn’t put a man on the moon, until we did. \n\nThese next two year will be interesting, and it will be very interesting after November.  Regardless if the Dems take control of both houses, there will be republicans that run on Anti Trump platforms and win seats.  I feel like enough will cross the line to vote him out.  '
'I don’t feel like your making yourself clear enough, to me that read like : “ while in office he can just pardon himself for later.”\n\nSeems like you’d have to designate what crime you are being pardoned for. You couldn’t just go “ I pardon myself for any crimes I might of done or might do in the future “ \n\nAnd I’ve been drinking so I’m probably just confused but ... yeah that’s how I took it '
'Not actually true.\n\n“Perhaps the most famous presidential pardon of all time occurred before any charges were filed. Gerald Ford\'s pardon of Richard Nixon absolved the former president of "all offenses against the United States which he … has committed or may have committed or taken part in" between the date of his inauguration in 1969 and his resignation in August 1974”\n\nThat\'s as vague as it can be.  *All* offenses he has or may have committed,or taken part in.\n\n\nSource: http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2008/07/preemptive_presidential_pardons.html'

We had a Democratic party that refused to pull a fast one and get a Democratic President put in place as, at the time Watergate was exposed, Spiro Agnew had resigned, and there was no VP, so if Nixon was impeached or resigned, the Speaker of the House, Carl Albert, a Democrat, would become President. This despite the Republicans winning the \'72 election in a landslide over McGovern.

'> Special Counsel Robert Mueller\'s investigators met this past summer with the former British spy whose dossier on alleged Russian efforts to aid the Trump campaign spawned months of investigations that have hobbled the Trump administration, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\n> Information from Christopher Steele, a former MI-6 officer, could help investigators determine whether contacts between people associated with the Trump campaign and suspected Russian operatives broke any laws.\n\n> CNN has learned that the FBI and the US intelligence community last year took the Steele dossier more seriously than the agencies have publicly acknowledged. James Clapper, then the director of national intelligence, said in a January 2017 statement that the intelligence community had "not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable."\n\n> The intelligence agencies, particularly the CIA, and the FBI took Steele\'s research seriously enough that they kept it out of a publicly-released January report on Russian meddling in the election in order to not divulge which parts of the dossier they had corroborated and how.\n\n> This contrasts with attempts by President Donald Trump and some lawmakers to discredit Steele and the memos he produced.\n\n> Ever since the dossier came to light in January, Trump and his allies have repeatedly insisted that it is a complete work of fiction. He told The New York Times this summer that the dossier "was totally made-up stuff." In a series of tweets earlier this year, Trump said the memos were written by a "failed spy" who had relied on "totally made-up facts by sleazebag political operatives."\n\n> While the most salacious allegations in the dossier haven\'t been verified, its broad assertion that Russia waged a campaign to interfere in the election is now accepted as fact by the US intelligence community. CNN also reported earlier this year that US investigators have corroborated some aspects of the dossier, specifically that some of the communications among foreign nationals mentioned in the memos did actually take place.\n\n'

Because they also have huge liberal audiences.   What do you expect? That people who spend their entire careers writing hit pieces on nearly half the population? Isn\'t going to be liked by that population?\n\n\nJesus it\'s fucking obvious.   Fox news is just a cash in on the absolutely myopic outlook that the other big news agencies failed to understand.  Not everyone is left of center.  In fact a significant portion of the population is conservative.  Just because they don\'t like "you" because you build a career highlighting their worse, don\'t acknowledge their best and spend day after day writing opinion piece after opinion piece that only fits in your narrow progressive liberal view.

In fact, on many non-partisan issues their factual coverage (where they do cover a topic) is more expansive, although tinged with conservative rhetoric. [They were the first outlet covering the recent release of an American from Venezuelan prison to describe his charges and explain why the charges were allegedly false](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/05/26/trump-says-utah-man-in-venezuelan-jail-to-be-released.html).\n\nThe issue isn\'t with the content per se, but with the desire not to be told what to believe or what to do by people with more expertise than you, which is the exact job of a professional press. The anti-elite sentiment drives a desire for sensationalized press, and that populism is why outlets like the Wall Street Journal, which does great reporting from a conservative perspective, are labelled "MSM" rather than being accepted as "conservative media."'

The Solar Cell tariffs sundown in 4 more years and no economist think it will benefit the US solar economy, as new factories will not come on line to taje advantage of the tariffs before they sundown but it will help the Chinese and the Russians If you look at the EPA, NASA and almost every other federal agency that measures and control emission and hydrocarbon standards are under attack to help the hydrocarbon industry. fortunatly to repeal most of the important pollution controls, the EPA and other agencies do not have supportive documentation to show the court when the EPA is sued, so only very simple rules will be actually repealed.

Since it's unlikely people would have been signing NDAs just to be in a class with him in the 1960s at UPenn, it really beg the question what was the loudmouth narcissistic braggart doing in classes there that he's not remembered?

"I am not crapping on people who transfer schools. I *am* **crapping on Trump for his hypocrisy** for not telling people he went to Fordham while he is loudly telling people how his intelligence is proven by having gone to UPenn ... if ala Trump, your undergrad = your IQ then you have to inform people about both your undergrads.\n  \nBtw, Obama also transferred schools (Occidental College for first 2 years) but he also doesn't hide that he went to Occidental first AND he doesn't equate that his undergrad schools equate to how intelligent a person is. \n  \n...  I also don't think undergrad school = your IQ. (IQ is also socially determined, is a biased criteria \nJust using as short hand for intelligence as flawed as it is) People from privileged backgrounds are accepted at a much higher rate into higher ranked universities-- education levels of parents, access to best k-12 schools, all the other privileges of being wealthy, and being white are still huge advantages in life in the US today. In Trump's time, it was even more so... I know someone who is slightly younger than Trump who went to Princeton, he has commented that before his time, it was even harder to get into Princeton being Jewish ... can you imagine how hard in the 60s being a poor minority from a crappy inner city school would have been to get into UPenn in comparison to Trump? Bush, president 43, is the same age as Trump and went to Yale...proving again my point.\n  \nSorry-not sorry but Trump's elitism about education and hypocrisy about ignoring Fordham gets my goat. He also really angers --and frightens me-- with his talk about *good* nay **incredible genes**.  "
"You're right. Daddy trump applies cash to the Dean's hand, and he's accepted. "
"As someone who actually transferred schools, let me assure you its not the same application process, or the same level of competition from other students. And yes, it becomes far easier to pay money through this avenue. Go to an ivy league campus and ask students if they look at transfer students slightly differently - in fact most transfer students aren't forthcoming about that information as they know it makes them look less qualified.

For instance, people like Don Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney and John Ashcroft kept popping up somewhere or another in elected seats or appointed posts for the GOP starting from as far back as -- in the case of Rumsfeld -- the Eisenhower administration. On the other hand, the Democrats have people like Joe Biden, John Kerry and Tim Kaine.\n\nSantorum served two terms in the US House, and two terms in the US Senate. I can almost guarantee that his name is on an unwritten list of \'reliable conservatives\' that gets pulled from memory whenever there are posts somewhere to be filled, and that since Trump got elected, *at least one* person has asked the question, "What about Santorum?

"I'm sure Mueller's testicles are galvanized steel. However, the true power rises from the majestic jawline. "
"You're going to have to source all that, and show more connections between each. It does sound like a massive stretch. Uranium One is under investigation by congress, not the DoJ, FBI, or Mueller. The Podesta group is a lobbying firm, they're allowed to deal with foreign clients. \n\nAt this point in time Russia wasn't under sanctions so the sale isn't illegal, the uranium can't be exported and isn't used for weapons, a 9 person committee had to unanimously approve the sale. I don't see how its related at all to the Mueller investigation.\n\nDon Jr\nJared Kushner\nMichael Flynn\nCarter Page\n\nAre all more likely. "
"Dude, calm down. This isn't Trump vs Hillary anymore, the election is over. This is an investigation to find illegal activity, everybody in this thread should want any criminals within our government to be indicted, not just ones from the other party. That's crazy. And nobody should get their news from one source, including both Hillary supporters and Trump supporters. Do yourself a favor and read some opposing viewpoints and try to actually disprove them. Like be critical of your own thoughts, not just the thoughts of others. There's a reason Russian efforts seem to always favor Donald Trump. Whether there's collusion or not, why does Russia want to help them? That's a very fair question and one that should not be easily dismissed. "

"No doubt, but it was fighting these demaons as well as his own, that finally caught up with him.\n\nI was fortunate to meet both Hunter S. Thompson and Donald Trump, in person, well before either became famous, Trump at a CUNY housing seminar in New York in '78 and Thompson, at a talk at Cal-Berkeley in '74. I was far more inspired by Thompson's take on life than Trumps take on Housing. Thompson had just published his seminal F&L on the Campaign Trail, and quite frankly said to everybody that Nixon will walk with a pardon, but hoped he will resign (he was right) Trump told everyone at the Housing seminar that he will become a Billionaire, but not in Housing, but in Real Estate redevelopment in New York City.

Both of these guys went to the mat against the political machine in fighting against TSP reauthorization. \n\nNothing, *nothing*, Fox News and President Trump can say will so much as phase these guys. They've been through worse - and the history books already show that they're the good guys even while they're still writing the conclusion. \n\nA party built around people like Comey, Mueller, Yates, etc. probably wouldn't work because it takes a certain ego to want to set the course for a country, and I'm not sure they have it.

'Here comes the backtracking lol. \n\nBias, even if it’s just perceived bias, is a huge issue in the criminal justice system. The texts would have disqualified from them from being on a jury but not from a being investigators on a special counsel, whose sole purpose is to conduct an unbiased investigation? The other crazy thing is that we’re just hearing about it 6 months after they were removed. It’s almost like they were trying to keep it hidden. Thank goodness for the OIG investigation. '
'>\tIn the United States, a special prosecutor (or special counsel or independent counsel) is a lawyer appointed to investigate, and potentially prosecute, a particular case of suspected wrongdoing for which a conflict of interest exists for the usual prosecuting authority.\n\nIt’s the definition. It’s supposed to be unbiased. It’s supposed to be free from conflicts of interest. Even perceived bias and conflicts of interest should be avoided. The texts show that that’s really not the case. Again, these people wouldn’t have even been allowed on a jury for a Trump or Clinton trial due to the texts yet they’re allowed on a special counsel? Even if this revelation doesnt amount to anything that still should have never happened. \n\nIt’s everyone’s business when the President is potentially being investigated for high crimes. Again, the special counsel’s purpose is to remove the image of bias or conflicts of interest; not telling the public about conflicts of interest and bias within the special counsel goes completely against that. A simple, “We found some bias, so we removed him. Thanks.” would have been better than what we got. \n\nYou’re just trying to downplay the significance of this. It’s not just Fox reporting on the texts, I’ve seen articles by Politico and CBS. \n\n'
'Wrong. They are. Like I said bias in the criminal justice system, even if just perceived is a huge issue. You don’t want people who are biased investigating/prosecuting/representing/etc. subjects of the case. \n\nWrong again, it’s everyone’s business and especially when the people assigned to investigate without bias and conflicts of interest are shown to have bias and conflicts of interest. It’s not just Fox. If this was just another manufactured story you wouldn’t see multiple other news sources report on it. \n\nI’m going to keep repeating this because it destroys your entire argument; the texts would have disqualified these people from being on a jury in a Trump/Clinton trial but not a special counsel whose sole purpose is to conduct an unbiased investigation free from conflicts of interest? There really is no response to that simple fact. At some point you’re going to have to not be biased and realize that this isn’t a partisan issue. Bias and conflicts of interest are a huge no no in the criminal justice system. '

'**Rhoticity in English**\n\nRhoticity in English refers to English speakers\' pronunciation of the historical rhotic consonant /r/, and is one of the most prominent distinctions by which varieties of English can be classified. The historical English /r/ sound is preserved in all pronunciation contexts in the "rhotic varieties" of English, which primarily include the English dialects of Scotland, Ireland, and most of the United States and Canada. However, the historical /r/ is not pronounced except before vowels in "non-rhotic varieties", which include most of the dialects of modern England, Wales, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and some parts of the southern and eastern—particularly northeastern—coastal United States.In non-rhotic varieties, speakers no longer pronounce /r/ in postvocalic environments—that is, when it is immediately after a vowel and not followed by another vowel.  For example, a rhotic English speaker pronounces the words hard and butter as /ˈhɑːrd/ and /ˈbʌtər/, whereas a non-rhotic speaker "drops" or "deletes" the /r/ sound, pronouncing them as /ˈhɑːd/ and /ˈbʌtə/.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

'Because:\n\na) Nobody "really" believed Trump would win at any stage. \n\nBUT,\n\nb) The Trump candidacy was prime entertainment and brought ratings. "What would wacky Trump say now!" was always a better news item than "look at these politicians disagreeing on issues.". The prime example was CNN broadcasting half an hour of empty tarmac waiting a Trump airplane instead of an actual debate or whatever that happened at the same time.'
"All in all...Im quite glad trump got elected. With all the shit that's been happening, we'd never be able to unfuck our country without his help. We've been taking for more steps to cut out the corruption in the last year than we ever have. He has united us....Against him, and against most of his radical constituents. "
"I voted for Trump... not because I supported him, I felt disenfranchised by the democratic party after what they did to Bernie Sanders.  The impression I was given was that the democratic party felt entitled to my vote, I was told that I had to vote for Hillary, I owed my support to the party.  But, I don't work that way, I did not (and I still don't) support Hillary Clinton, both candidates were unpalatable to me.  While this isn't directly the party's fault, I was bombarded by activists shaming me for my choice to not vote, that was when I decided to use my vote as a protest and cast it for Donald Trump.  I don't regret that Hillary did not win, but I do regret that Trump is the president and had I known there was even the slightest chance he would actually win, I would have stuck to my original plan to not vote at all.  \n\nI live in a red state, so ultimately my vote didn't matter but I can't help but feel responsible in some small way for where we are now.  It's a shameful thing, I've never even told my friends about it and only a few members of my family know.  For a long time I didn't believe the Russia story, I just assumed Democrats were swinging wildly to push back against a controversial president.  I dismissed the dossier out of hand as ridiculous but now it seems all of it was true, or that it could be true.  I'm sorry that I helped perpetuate this, even if my vote didn't matter."

"> Wy else would they agree to share classified evidence and documents from the Mueller investigation with Nunes?\n\nMaybe because Nunes is heading the Congressional committee, and has security clearances? \n\nNote how he hasn't spoken publicly about that evidence. \n\nHas Nunes had his security clearance revoked?"
'>right, but this discussion speculates that Mueller issues the subpoena to block congress from getting information related to his investigation\n\nNo, Rachel Maddow speculated that\n\n> I just find it odd that Muellers direct superiors aggree to share some of is hinformation with members of congress who clearly try to hamper and discredit his investigation. \n\nMe too - which is why I\'m fairly confident that they didn\'t actually get any significant information.  Nunes met with Mueller, but we don\'t know what he learned.  \n\nI have a feeling that he mostly got a lot of "That information is privileged and you will not be receiving it."\n\n> The issue is that Nunes would take info from Mueller and funnel it to the WH which is subject to the investigation.\n\nThere\'s no way Mueller was unaware of that possibility.  Mueller can stonewall as much as he wants to; I\'m sure he wouldn\'t release any information that would hurt the investigation.'
'It’s a good metaphor because Mueller has an entire set of complex rules he has to follow but Trump can pretty much do what he wants.'
'Ever try to play this board? Checkers have to stay on their colors...but they can double jump. I wonder how this would play out? '
"I'm genuinely curious how it plays out. \n\nIf it's the CHECKERS that have the advantage, imagine the bets and payouts you could win (until word gets out). "
"Oh I didn't think it was an original line but now her song chun-li is stuck in my head. Also I appreciate the bonus denzel so much"

'**RAISE Act**\n\nThe RAISE (Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment) Act is a bill introduced in the United States Senate in 2017. Co-sponsored by Republican senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue, the bill seeks to reduce levels of legal immigration to the United States by 50% by halving the number of green cards issued. The bill would also impose a cap of 50,000 refugee admissions a year and would end the visa diversity lottery. The bill received the support of President Donald Trump, who promoted a revised version of the bill in August 2017, and was opposed by Democrats, immigrant rights groups, and some Republicans.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

Both sides have previously praised and reguarded him as ethical. Rod Rosenstein (who appointed Mueller) recommended his firing. Comey himself testified that his firing didnt affect the investigation.

'> They were called the National Socialist party you dweeb.\n\nHoly fucking god damn shit if I see this one more time.\n\n>Early on, they were definitely what we would call "socialist." When the NSDAP was created, they released a 25-point program that did include many stipulations and demands that were recognized as socialist, including state ownership of land (point 17) and redistribution of capital (point 14).\n\n>***The Nazis then proceeded to enact precisely none of those policies when they had control of the government.*** All the socialist demands dropped off completely and the nationalist ones became the party platform - the part about citizenship being restricted to the German race (read: not Jews) and demands of land/territory for expansion (Lebensraum).\n\n> There was a wing of the Nazi party that did actually take the "socialism" part of their name seriously and tried to recruit the same working class young people that the communists did. The Strasser brothers (Gregor and Otto) were the most important leaders of this "left wing" of the party, and Roehm was in there as well. The Nazis also worked with the communists in the Berlin transit strike.\n\n>However, ***Hitler himself was definitely in the "conservative wing" of the party and he obviously won***. One of the Strassers was murdered in 1934 as Hitler purged the party of its left wing. The main Nazis who emerged in power, with the exception of Goebbels, who switched from the Strasser faction to Hitler, didn\'t have any attachment to socialism whatsoever and worked hand-in-hand with big business.\n'
'**It Can\'t Happen Here**\n\nIt Can\'t Happen Here is a semi-satirical 1935 political novel by American author Sinclair Lewis, and a 1936 play adapted from the novel by Lewis and John C. Moffitt.\n\nPublished during the rise of fascism in Europe, the novel describes the rise of Berzelius "Buzz" Windrip, a politician who defeats Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) and is elected President of the United States, after fomenting fear and promising drastic economic and social reforms while promoting a return to patriotism and "traditional" values. After his election, Windrip takes complete control of the government and imposes a plutocratic/totalitarian rule with the help of a ruthless paramilitary force, in the manner of Adolf Hitler and the SS. The novel\'s plot centers on journalist Doremus Jessup\'s opposition to the new regime and his subsequent struggle against it as part of a liberal rebellion.\n\nReviewers at the time, and literary critics ever since, have emphasized the connection with Louisiana politician Huey Long, who was preparing to run for president in the 1936 election when he was assassinated in 1935 just prior to the novel\'s publication.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

'There should be another award for leaving that promising education/career track and *volunteering* to join the Marines and go to Vietnam..\n\nThis was a time when guys would inhale a bit of Mercury so it’d look like they had a hole in their lung in the X-rays during their physical (or so I’ve been told).\n\nMaybe a giant pair of brass balls or something.'
'The V device stands for Valor, on both the Bronze Star and the Navy Commendation. Both awards can be earned for Meritorious service, but Mueller got them for courage in combat.\n\nThe star on the Navy Commendation means he has two of them, though only one is for Valor.'
"First part of your comment is absolutely correct, and something missed by a lot of comments.\n\nHowever, he did seem to try to profer that info regarding a lack of retainer and such clearly to indicate he wasn't his attorney.\n\nIf he assumed, at the time he made the statements, that they were protected by pricilege, then by the very definition of the New York Bar's ethical rules (and really everyone else's similar rule), he had assumed an attorney/client relationship. And, again, Cohen submitted sworn pleadings saying that Hannity was a client. If that's the case, what does it matter whether or not he had paid a retainer?\n\nAnd finally, when reporting on such a story, isn't it a relevant conflict when you're defending the guy when you are simultaneously 33% of his entire client base? I would think so -- regardless of my political inclinations. Let's be fair."
'>You guys just keep fishing, acting like Sean wouldn\'t have railed against the Cohen raid if he didn\'t get legal advice from Cohen and was afraid of getting disclosed.\n\nBut why would he? Raiding a lawyer of the President is no easy task. I imagine the warrant that allowed them to do that will be one of the most scrutinized warrants of all time. You think a judge was just like "lol it\'s Trump\'s lawyer do whatever bro"?\n\nI don\'t understand why Hannity would be against the raid unless he has some interest beyond truth. (IE: he has something with Cohen he doesn\'t want found *or* he wants Trump to not have an investigation going for...some...reason?\n\n>He rails against Mueller and the Russia coup every day.\n\nI don\'t really understand why anyone would speak out against the Mueller investigation. You\'d think they\'d want Mueller to do his investigation and be like "ya, Trump was right the whole time".\n\nEdit: Regarding Hannity specifically, I don\'t think he matters that much. It\'s just funny that Cohen was like "Um, attorney client privileged" and Hannity was like "uh, I was never his client." It kinda makes Cohen look extra dumb.'
'I agree with much of what you wrote, though my views are nuanced. \n\nI think what needs to be emphasized is Hannity\'s lack of legal knowledge.  It\'s reasonable to think that Hannity thought he could have privileged conversations with someone (and to hand over a $10 bill to obtain the privilege) yet still not be formally considered that person\'s client. I love Hannity but I\'m not blind - he has no idea what he\'s talking about when it comes to attorney-client privilege.  \n\nWhile I do think Hannity should have disclosed his "conflict", I think there\'s a lot of mitigating factors which don\'t make this a big deal, such as:\n\n1. He would be railing against the Cohen raid/Mueller witch hunt anyway. \n\n2. He, with his lack of legal knowledge, could have genuinely thought he wasn\'t a client of Cohen\'s if the extent of his relationship with Cohen was informal legal advice about real estate deals (a couple of phone calls here and there)\n\n3. If you want to be fair, you need to hold liberal pundits who use the same attorneys/firms and/or have close personal relationships with people like the Clintons and Obamas to the same standard.  In my opinion, this "Hannity standard" is ridiculous, many pundits on both sides have powerful, ideologically aligned friends (and even non-ideologically aligned friends).\n\nHowever, I agree with Dershowitz and am glad he gave Hannity an earful.  Given the political sensitivity in this particular instance I would have preferred disclosure but I also don\'t think its really a big deal.\n'
'Ok, and I apologize for my late reply, however: \n\nFrom a pro-Hannity perspective, I don\'t see those statements as being necessarily exclusive of each other. Hannity, who doesn\'t really understand how attorney-client privilege works, can reasonably think that he can pay someone $10 to have privileged discussions yet still not be considered, legally, that person\'s formal client. \n\nYet at the end of the day it\'s just not relevant. What is there to be suspicious over?  One cannot reasonably advocate for turning the Mueller Trump-Russia collusion probe into full-fledged life-investigations into anyone caught in Mueller\'s web. I understand how this story would raise eyebrows, but when you dig into it and learn that about a year ago Hannity on his show publicly mentioned talking to Cohen about the real estate deal in Dubai, and consider Hannity\'s lack of legal knowledge (and embarrassment at having been caught blindsided at being mentioned...I honestly think he didn\'t consider himself a client), I don\'t see what\'s "suspicious".\n\nWhile we may still disagree, I\'d like to say that despite the downvote, my conversations in this sub have been incredibly civil and its very refreshing. It\'s good to see that some of you are interested in the truth and equal application of justice under the law, no matter which side the hammer falls on. '
'My position is while I personally would have liked disclosure, it\'s 1) a ridiculous standard and 2) everyone on this sub losing their minds about Hannity is hypocritical because they are not applying the Hannity Standard to commentators on their (or, if neutral, the other) political side. \n\n1. So we disagree on the probability Hannity thought he was a "client".  Also, we can talk about bias all day -- I think your assumption that its "not probable" reflects your bias. \n\n2.  So why don\'t all of the media disclose all of their personal and/or professional relationships with DNC/Clinton/Obama? You\'re not holding commentators on both sides to the Hannity Standard, only.....Hannity.  I don\'t see anybody on this sub criticizing George Stephanopoulos for not disclosing he was Bill\'s Communications Director and later Senior Advisor. BUT I also don\'t expect it because I just disagree with the standard you are trying to impose.\n\n3.  "I think it would reflect proper journalistic integrity to reveal a personal or professional relationship if you are reporting on a matter" I agree that this is a good sentiment for JOURNALISTS doing solely fact-based reporting, but Hannity is not a journalist, he is a commentator. If Rachel Maddow used Perkins Coie for some real estate advice I don\'t think she needs to disclose that despite it admittedly being some juicy tabloid fodder (as the Hannity stuff was for you guys)\n\n4.  You can\'t just dismiss someone validly pointing out double standards via "whataboutism".  We don\'t need to compare everything to the Clintons, but because your side does not believe in the equal application of standards (whether legal or not), such comparisons are justified in order to point out the blatant disregard for said equal application of the standards. \n\nWhile you may be the exception, the vast majority of lefties do NOT apply the same standards to their favored politicians and commentators. It\'s one thing to be "biased" and be more sympathetic to your side\'s position; it\'s another to wholly embrace double standards benefitting your side and dismiss anyone who calls them out on it with "whataboutism". \n\n'

States and cities have the right to adopt local laws that pertain to local elections, such as the school board election in question in SF.\n\nIf SF were allowing illegal immigrants to register and vote in *federal* elections then it would definitely be illegal, but that's not what's happening. SF is registering certain non-citizens who have children in the local school systems (many of the children are citizens by birth) to vote in the local school board election, but those registrations do not extend to any other election at any level, and therefore it IS perfectly legal to do - it's completely within the jurisdiction of the city to make special laws pertaining to city-level elections. It's not even close to the first city to make this decision, either.\n\nThe names don't even enter the federal election roll, which is what you would need to be on to vote in a federal election.\n\nUnderstand?"

Pretty worthy cause. '
'Putting money into infrastructure creates jobs and improves the economy. Why so many politicians call it "boring" and don\'t want to do it, is beyond me. '
"Where have you seen politicians calling that boring?\n\nBut anyhow, what's going on is that politicians don't want to commit to infrastructure spending because they're going to get the political hit for spending money/taking on governmental debt/raising taxes, while some guy down the line (maybe even the guy who uses the hit from the infrastructure spending to beat them in the next election) is going to be the one to get the positive press when the project finishes.\n\nIn a similar vein, this is why politicians are often easy to persuade to support new construction but hard to persuade to support maintenance/renewal/etc. You don't get a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a highway repaving, but you do get a ribbon-cutting ceremony for building a new highway--they're incentivized to go for things for which they can claim credit (and avoid acknowledging responsibility for any potential negatives)."

"That's not a fair comment at all. There are a LOT of intelligent republicans. I know an absolute ton of them. However, most of them are wealthy enough that they support Republicans to protect their assets. They don't typically care (at least not as passionately) about the Republican positions on things like abortion or gay marriage. \n\nUnfortunately, the larger part of the Republican party are those who've been bamboozled into it by the promise of pushing their moral directives. They vote against their own economic, health, and other interests in the hopes that by vilifying the opposing position, they'll eventually get their 1-2 core issues legislated, and they do so completely oblivious to the reality that they're pawns for politicians who honestly don't remotely care about those issues, and often are the largest violator of those morals.\n"
'Most of the smart republicans I know swallowed their pride and voted Clinton, or else "threw their vote away for Evan McMullin or Gary Johnson, because they saw Trump for what he is. Very few have ever been on the Trump train or even tepidly supportive of him. \n\nAnd no, these are not independents. Most have voted straight ticket Republican for decades, still hesitate to criticize anything about Bush\'s presidency, etc. Several were delagates in the Republican primary (my state went heavily to Cruz, something like 70%). '
"The problem is we don't have a viable third (or fourth) party. If your primary interests are economic, you vote Republican. Many of them would probably be Libertarian if it were viable. Others would totally jump on a fiscally conservative/socially liberal or moderate platform.\n\nI totally get what you're saying though. I've had conversations with many of the smart Republicans I know, and they either use mental gymnastics to convince themselves that charity can fill the voids created by Republican policies, or they believe we should fund the social net by reducing the military (obviously dissenting from the R platform on this issue). However, they still feel more strongly about low taxes, lower regulation on their businesses, etc. \n\n"
"Absolutely. Trump was within his legal rights to fire Comey. His motivation is what would make it obstruction.

"Manafort is in the Northern Neck Regional Jail in Virginia about 90 miles from DC. He *checked in* around 8 pm. His personal visitation day is Fridays from 2:15 to 3:15 and visits can only be for 30 minutes with up to 3 family members/friends. It's the type of visitation through glass where both inmate and visitors talk on the phone. He can also have video conferencing with family/friends throughout the week...it doesn't look like any limit on nbr of video calls but each one can only be 20 minutes. That means in-person Manafort will only be able to have visits from attorneys and attorney staff until *next* Friday. Attorneys cannot bring any of his friends or family with them -- indeed they have to sign an affidavit if any non-attorneys present that these people are not his family or friends.\n  \n* That's a long time for someone accustomed to the finer things to only have inmates, jail officers, members of the justice system like Mueller and his own attorneys for company imho. \n  \nHe's in the VIP section of the jail. CNN reported he was taken to this jail for his safety.\n  \nIt sounds like it'll be a long 3 months for Paulie if he's not preemptively pardoned."

"I mean I'd like to think so, but if you look at the timelines for other federal investigations and compare then it looks like Mueller's investigation is not too far along. The good news is there are enough senate republicans backing Mueller that filibustering a replacement for Rosenstein is probable.\n\nA kill switch would mean guaranteed conviction on charges of at least obstruction of justice. But the reality is that with only an obstruction of justice charge people will take to the streets and riot. Mueller needs time to build a case, organize the evidence, and piece together a timeline. To do this properly I think we're looking at another year minimum for all those involved to be charged. My best guess is that 1.5-2years from now this will becoming to an end."
"Obstruction of justice for sure because we already have the Nixon template for how to handle this. But why such a low probability for the tax evasion and money laundering? I feel like Trump encourages investigations into his finances simply by the sheer fact that he never released his tax returns and he specifically told mueller he's not allowed to look at his finances."

'I thought I remembered hearing that there were a lot of Russian bots tied to the rabid Sanders support, and that he had been targeted too.

Kinda like how I\'ve never met a vegan who tried to force me to become vegan, but I have met a ton of people who bitch about "preachy vegans." Otherwise, the only preachy vegan shit I\'ve ever seen has come from some text post on Tumblr. Doesn\'t mean they don\'t exist, just that I noticed what I was seeing a lot of online didn\'t measure up to my in-person, day to day experiences.

'
"Russia's goal wasn't necessarily to push trump, but to divide the country.  They happen to have gotten a very useful idiot out of the process though.\n\nAll considered, planting a man in the campaign of a promising underdog candidate isn't a bad idea if their goal is to break apart the democrats.  I guess we'll see how far this goes, but for now, I'd like to see if any more reputable sources pick this up.  I don't really have the highest opinion of the sites that are running this story so far."
"Oops, I hired a foreign agent to manage my campaign!\n\nOops, my campaign changed the GOP platform to benefit Russian interests!\n\nOops, I knew that Russia was responsible, but I kept saying others were.\n\nOops, my NSA had to go (which I really didn't want to happen) because he was caught having secret meetings with the Russian ambassador, which he then lied about to the FBI.\n\nOops, I fired my FBI director to stop the investigation.\n\nOops, my son had a meeting with Russian agents who promised him dirt.\n\nOops, I then instructed him to lie about the reason for that meeting.\n\nOops, I sided with Putin over my intelligence agencies and Department of Justice.\n\nYeah, I guess you're right, surely this is nothing more than a bad choice of campaign manager."
'I\'d say that Bernie Sanders genuinely did not have a cult of personality in the same way that Trump does. The core distinction, in my view, is that Bernie\'s supporters saw him as a *champion*, where Trump\'s supporters see Trump as a *leader*.\n\nThe difference lies in who is working for who. To Bernie supporters, the important thing was getting a progressive into office. Any progressive would do. Bernie was adopted as their candidate of choice because he was a high-profile progressive running for president, but Bernie himself was never anything more than the face of the movement. If Bernie had suddenly said, "Actually, now that I think about it, universal health care is bad", then his core supporters would have abandoned him. Their support was conditional on his support of their favored policies.\n\nNow, it\'s true that a lot of Trump supporters see Trump like that. But the core Trump supporters, the true cult of personality, do not. They don\'t see Trump as working for them, they see themselves as working for Trump. If Trump were to declare tomorrow that he was enacting open borders, his core supporters would immediately become pro-open-borders. It\'s a *literal* cult, and the central tenet of the faith is that Trump is always right.'
'Also when you still believe (to this day) the LIE that Clinton won because of super delegates; you might have something clouding reality. '
'I agree with you, even if the majority of Reddit does not. I initially supported Bernie, but got totally turned off, not only by him and his inept campaign, but by his rabid supporters. There were comparisons to Jesus, Ghandi, Mother Teresa. The cult got creepy and extreme. I pray he doesn’t run again. '
"And that man's name? [Robert Mueller](https://i2.wp.com/www.rantt.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/1_Cx28n7QGze6aQU-w1Dtzdw_1200px.jpeg?ssl=1); American Hero and  [billionaire conmen destroyer](http://www.famous-trials.com/enron/1790-indictment)"
'Yeah I mean there’s outside influence across the board, I think you’re right. Russia is interested in causing chaos perhaps more so than just supporting certain candidates.\n\nI wouldn’t be surprised if Russia is currently trying to feed on trump push back this week to destabilize us even more.'
"Pretty sure you don't actually understand the concept behind evidence..."
'You guys I\'m beginning to think that Trump doesn\'t care about having an actual belief structure beyond "does this benefit me"'
'I thought that was pretty clear from the get-go. He believes whatever he thinks serves him in the moment to believe.'
"Interesting stuff! In the UK we don't have a written constitution, so our rights come from an accumulation of years of precedence, custom, and acts of parliament. I think there's equivalent rights over here but it's not as specifically enumerated as in the 5th amendment. There's waning and waxing enthusiasm for a proper bill of rights but nothing has come of it, because by and large we feel that we value being able to change the law as time dictates without having to make it a massive deal (like amending the Constitution is in the US).\n\nIs the 5th amendment a thing that has had its day, do you think? An anomaly that no longer serves its purpose (as it seems to be a bit of a non-starter from my point of view) or is it a vital part of the framework? If the constitution was written today, would it still be in there?\n\nBeyond the scope of the original post I know but I'm curious."
"would closing the donald help though? I promise I'm not trolling. follow me on this....\n\nsmashing the nest forces out all of that excrement on to the other subs. having the donald there keeps it contained for the time being."
"Wouldn't it be great if everybody Trump has been asking for loyalty from save the obvious suspects we're all just doing what Mueller told them to do, I mean what if Trump has just been consistently feeding information to the investigation and Trump had no idea that that he was doing it, it would just be glorious.\n It would also be glorious if I use better punctuation."

'Hopefully, this one will be solved at the ballot box. \n\nWith the level of political involvement in highschool students, I feel really positive about the near future. Republicans better realize that all these 16-17 year olds they are dismissing as "children" will all be "voters" by 2020.'
"You mean all three branches of the federal government owned by the wannabe-dictator's party?  Yeah, those checks are real helpful right now.  /s"

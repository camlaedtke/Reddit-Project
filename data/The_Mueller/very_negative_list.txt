Trump says if you oppose him, that means you want to go to war -- endless troll accounts are chirping the same nonsense -- so I just wanted to note that this is a common form of Russian propaganda.
Hillary testified. No closed doors. No questions in advance. No sniveling.
12 Russian intelligence agents were just charged with attacking the US, Trump directly encouraged that attack, Trump directly benefitted from that attack. And Trump just blamed it all on us, on his way to a private meeting with Putin. This is the Republican party. They hate America.
Flynn charged with lying to the FBI
Fox News MUST respond: "Who at Fox News knew that Sean Hannity had a secret relationship with Trump lawyer Michael Cohen?" If the answer is "nobody" then Hannity should be fired. Any other answer may indicate conspiracy.
Trump's latest whine -- "why didn't the FBI warn me Russians might try to infiltrate my campaign!?!" -- which totally makes sense, if you ignore that the FBI warned Trump that Russians might try to infiltrate his campaign.
Why are we letting this happen? Especially after the Senate Intel committee confirmed a hostile government's plans to meddle in our election... We can not allow him alone with the leader of that hostile government. It is time for mass protests. Not later, now.
In The Beginning, there was: "We never had any contacts with Russians, period!" When caught, Trump lied: "it was only about adoptions!" Caught again, it became: "but we didn't get anything!" Now they have stooped to: "Hey! Look! Over there! A taxi!" The GOP is trying to steal our whole country.
Friday Giuliani: "Trump intervened in the Time Warner-AT&T merger!" -- Saturday Giuliani: "Trump didn't intervene in the Time Warner-AT&T merger!" -- and 35% still believe these non-stop liars.
Here's a reminder that President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein were accused of violently raping a 13-year-old girl at an orgy in the 90s. She had to eventually drop the lawsuit due to fear for her life.
While Republicans act all outraged over the White House Correspondents Dinner, let's remember when Trump repeatedly defended himself from sexual assault claims by saying the women were too ugly for his taste to assault.

EXPOSED: Natalia Veselnitskaya’s supposed adoption NGO is a sham that got $500k from Russians to fight Magnitsky sanctions. Mueller now investigating!!!
White House reels as FBI director contradicts official claims about alleged abuser
If Obama had: - Paid off a porn star - Cheated on 3 wives - Had kids by 3 women - Married an immigrant - Had a host of campaign staffers plead guilty to federal crimes - Spent 1/3 of his time in office at resorts Republicans would have turned the world upside down!
This short video shows that Trump's "Russia, if you're listening" comment wasn't a joke. Let's make sure more people learn he was dead serious. And whenever somebody disregards his comment as just a joke, consider responding with this link.
No collusion? No collusion? Trump couldn't even stop himself from colluding with his personal doctor.
Since we're all handing out advice, Sean!! The trick to surviving prison is to kick someone's ass the first day or becomes someone's bitch. Then everything will be all right.
Let’s not forget how this evil scumbag got into a position where he could flip. He’s been been lying, cheating and intimidating Trump’s victims for decades.
Trump stopping "war games" with South Korea was Putin's idea
Conservative group seeks removal of judge from case targeting Mueller, citing political bias - Bobby's got them terrified.
Today Trump called James Comey a "leaker and liar" and then issued a presidential pardon to Scooter Libby for leaking and lying.
The right's war against Mueller will fail
Can’t wait to see his “base” and Fox justify the idea that kids died because of the Russia investigation. The man genuinely has no shame.
Trump won’t be able to maintain his fake tan and ridiculous comb over in prison.

Trump fires the National Security Advisor less than 24 hours after McMaster called out Russian cyber warfare efforts. Criticism of Russia GUARANTEES that Trump will fire you.
Republican rep Dana Rohrabacher says the Russian spy he met with can't possibly be a Russian spy because: "It’s ridiculous. It’s stupid. She’s the assistant of some guy who is the head of the bank and is a member of their Parliament. That’s what we call a spy?" (Protip: he's up for reelection)
Since Guccifer accidentally outed himself as a Russian agent, this story from 10 months ago is a hell of a lot more damning. GOP consultant Aaron Nevins asked for and received documents from hacker ‘Guccifer 2.0,’ and posted some on his blog
While Donald Trump refuses to enact sanctions on Russia, their campaign to destroy the U.S. continues unabated. Almost immediately after the Santa Fe school shooting, Russian trolls were spreading fake news that the shooter was an Antifa Clinton supporter.
Even Fox & Friends is dumping on Trump for openly siding with Russia -- but Trump still has Fox toads Hannity, Dobbs, Ingraham on his side. If open treason isn't enough for advertiser boycotts, what is?
For a man who complains about 'fake-news' so much, he seems to tweet an awful amount of it.

'Sketchy as Hell': AT&T Paid Trump Lawyer Michael Cohen for 'Insights' as FCC Worked to Kill Net Neutrality
After seeing Trump freak the fuck out on Twitter this morning when he called out Robert Mueller by name for the first time this weekend, despite being instructed by his legal team to avoid publicly criticizing Mueller by name or to directly antagonize the special counsel
McConnell just shut down the bill to protect Mueller. Given McConnell also threatened Obama when he tried to respond to the Russian attack, perhaps McConnell doesn't want Mueller protected just in case Mueller's investigation heads his way.
"I'll make those bastards pay!"
Trump to use manipulation of American public to sow distrust of investigation leading up to criminal trials. This is coming from the WH.
Trump: Threatens Russia with missiles, then blames Mueller for "Bad Blood" with Russia two hours later....
HOLY SHIT!!! New indictment. Spead this around
Reminder: Trump himself used Russian Active Measures, quoting lies from Russian propaganda site Sputnik, to attack Hillary Clinton in a major campaign speech in October 2016, during the attack on American democracy.
MFW I find out Manafort takes notes on a criminal conspiracy.
I've posted this twice already but unbelievably it's more relevant than ever. Blame US for Russian hacking? Fuck this traitor.
Oh look The_Dumb is calling for violence again, N.B.D. right Reddit admins?

Gary Cohn, Trump’s top economic adviser, resigns. In related news, Trump a little earlier today: "The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! There is no Chaos, only great Energy!"
Trump saw evidence that Putin personally ordered the attack on US elections even BEFORE he was inaugurated. He knew each time he tried to deflect blame away from them. He knew when he invited Lavrov to the Oval Office. He knew when he fired Comey. He fucking knew.
New leak shows how Russia's Internet Research Agency operated on Reddit, organized rallies now including in Georgia and New York -- and the Georgia rally escalated into violence. But Trump still pretends nothing happened, and the Republican party won't do anything to stop the ongoing attack.
So Trump just confessed that he knew Flynn lied to the FBI when he fired Comey in order to stop the investigation.
If Trump Fires Mueller, We Must Impeach: The country will find itself in a constitutional crisis, where the executive branch rejects checks and balances and the rule of law
Trump goes on unhinged rant on national TV, admits he stayed overnight in Russia, screams about Hillary getting debate questions, says Comey has committed "many crimes". Panicked Fox hosts try to stop him, fail.
@juliehdavis: Depressing sight at Trump rally in Nashville: adorable young boy, probly about my son's age, pointing iPhone at me & other reporters & snapping pix while screaming "FAKE NEWS!" A child who will grow up believing a free & fair press is the enemy, a bad thing, to be mocked & hated

Alex Jones pantomimes shooting Robert Mueller: "You're going to get it, or I'm going to die trying, bitch. Get ready"
Most Republicans acknowledge the Russian attack on the US election. But their next comment is always: "of course we know it had no impact." What infuriating bullshit! 1) They have no basis to make that claim; and, 2) They talked about Russian-hacked email endlessly. Of course it had an impact.

'[“When you’re attacking FBI agents because you’re under criminal investigation, you’re losing”.  \n— Sarah Huckabee Sanders](https://i.imgur.com/eTTQAxX.jpg)'
'So you people don’t think the FBI DOJ or OBama admin did anything illegal? WOW!!!!!!  '
"This Human Cheeto Hybrid doesn't care about the law, and doesn't care about us, once he finishes his term and loses the election it's back to his hotels and private life where he can whine and dine on KFC and Russian hookers all he wants with no more backlash. How these people thought he was anti-establishment, an outsider, and actually thought he cared for them is beyond anyone."
"What's corrupt about him?  Everything hes doing was promised on the campaign trail.  You can argue that you dont agree with his policies, but hes not corrupt.  This is especially true if you dont think Obama or Hillary were corrupt.  \n\nSo far, what people seem to be basing his corruption are his businesses, stormy daniels and the Russia collusion.  All of which are pretty baseless because 2 out the 3 are pretty fucking big deals.  This Russian investigation has been going to on for over a year with no evidence at all that has surfaced.  If anything, it's starting to show that the investigation is based off of made up warrants.  His business ties were severed when he became president and the only small overblown evidence that was brought up was a the China Indonesian deal that was done years ago.  \n\nYou people seem to think that because a lot of you get together and support each others ridiculous claims that it must be right.  I watch the left and sickens me to see how destructive you are.  You're all happy to see the us fail as long as trump fails.  When u watch the news about trump cancellingthe north Korea talk, it was as if they just won something.  Same for the economy.  The only time I ever saw the left news channels report on it was the the market crashed for a day.  \n\nI hope you know that people are starting to wake up to all the lefts bullshit.  When the midterms come around, you're going to have round 2 of that devastating loss in 2016 and it's going to be hilarious.  You people are so emotional about trump that everything else has slipped your mind.  The Democrats have nothing to run on except anti trump.  Crazy Pelosi is braggingabout raising the taxes again when they get back in office.  They got mad at trump for calling ms-13 animals.  They've literally went to supporting a criminal gang over trump.  Lol"
'My favorite is when they have to defend things that he\'s actually said.  \n  \n"No, remember, he said that when you\'re a star they *let you* do it, so all the kissing and the, er, cooter grabbing, it was all consensual!  He\'s not bragging about sexually assaulting women, he\'s bragging about being a stud!"  \n  \nOr...  \n  \n"Yeah, but when he said he fired Comey over \'this Russia thing\' he meant that, okay, he wasn\'t trying to stop the Russia investigation, which is a witch hunt anyway, he meant that the Russia thing, you know, the, it wasn\'t a big deal, and so he had to do it, okay?  He had to do it."  \n  \nOr...  \n  \n"When Donald Trump says \'we have to take out their families; when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families,\' he meant that you have to take their families *to safety,* like, take them *out of the war zone.*  He\'s not calling on the U.S. Military to target civilians, he\'s saying that we have to protect civilians!"  \n  \nThat last one is something someone really said to me, by the way, the \'take out their families\' one.  \n  \n/smh'
"Are you fucking shitting me?\n It wasn't plutonium! \nIt was Uranium!!! \nNot 20% of US Uranium. \n20% of production capacity. Which in fact is only running at 11%\nAlso I'm sure you have no fucking clue under the license that ban export from any U1H US facility.\n\nSo who the fuck are you calling idiots?"
"you've been lied to dumbass"
'You seem as terrified as trump is.'
'Goddamn his hair is disgusting'
'Well to bad this is a fantasy that will never happen. A President has to be impeached before he can be arrested. A President cannot even be indicted until they are impeached.'
'These anti Trump memes are our cancer'
"I think this meme is funny, but it's also inaccurate. If any criminal charges are going to come from Mueller, they will go to Congress. If Congress in both chambers remain Republican, I don't think any justice will occur. "
'This is basically a stolen Hillary meme. \nLow effort and bad execution.  '
'I wonder how much money this country spent on all these “investigations”. I guarantee you we could have fed entire third world villages for weeks, hell maybe even months. Sad. '
"This day wont come! Because it's a non issue sad little liberals use to lean on! Downvote me, ban me i dont care!"
"Write down this date - 01/08/2018 - and take a screen shot... \n\n*When this finally happens, although I don't think he will get arrested but he will indeed resign, HE WILL SHED TEARS.* "
'dream on! I think you should start by finding actual evidence of a trump russia collusion, until then this will likely not even come close to happening. A year into this bullshit and nothing has been found that can lead to trumps arrest, Oh how we just keep winning.'
'Sad you attack Mueller’s hair instead of his arguments. '
"It's for people who are pathetically hanging onto an ill defined FBI investigation to somehow reverse the undesirable outcome of an election.  Like a child refusing to believe santa isn't real, this group refuses to give up a fantasy."

The thinking was Trump loses the election, but gains a following and a voice to cause some trouble. But it would look so bad on Clinton if she investigated, as it would look like a political attack, that they just were all kinds of overt on it.  '

'That is a completely legitimate question.  Consider though that murdering Manafort or others only confirms the enormity of the situation.  If Manafort was shanked to death in jail, the shitstorm that would follow would be arguably worse for the Putin regime.  Also, Mueller has all the evidence they need from the raids on Manaforts properties.  So, putting Manafort away is icing on the cake.'
'The moment US citizens start getting killed on US soil because they fail to follow through on promises to Russia, there will be a hard split between the compromised people.

"Nixon actually asked the DOJ if he could pardon himself.\nThe DOJ's response? NO.\n\nTrump did not even bother to ask. He just proclaimed he had the right based on the legal scholarship of Rudy Giuliani and some other right wing attorney's.\n\nMy guess is that not only would SCOTUS offer an opinion of NO, but I think he might not be able to pardon people who are witnesses against him in and obstruction or any other criminal case. The President has pardon rights under the Constitution and they are broad. But Presidential pardons are also limited to Federal Cases, and cannot be used for self-enrichment. It easy to see that pardon issued to a potential witness, who also may be a co-conspirator or accomplice in a conspiracy or crime, would break the law. We have gun rights too, guaranteed by the Constitution, but we have limits on those rights as well."
'Nothing ever happens to rich politicians. I fucking hate this sub for getting my hopes up. fuck all you circlejerkers. Ban me. '
"There is no way self-pardon is Constitutional. I'm not a lawyer but I thought there is a long-standing (like pre-colonial times long-standing) concept in Common Law where someone cannot act as both a judge and a defendant in the same case that conflicts with the whole idea of a self-pardon. The whole idea that a president cannot be indicted doesn't sit right with me either. No one should be above the law. We've had loads of criminal congresspeople and governors and quite a few sketchy or outright criminal presidents. The idea that you can be immune to prosecution because you won an election does not seem like something that would have been intended by the founders. Of course they were a little idealistic in thinking that Congress would take their job seriously and impeach a criminal president too."
"That's what is dangerous. It's a might v. right scenario. It's objectively wrong to say that he can pardon himself, but what if he does and no one stops him? Or if they do, by what mechanism do they stop him? Are they going to march him out of the Oval Office in cuffs? What if he resists, or orders the secret service or military to aid him in resisting?"

"**WTF?**  **THAT** is some next level horseshit the likes of which I have not seen in a long time.

WTF is this?  Is it Agatha Christie channeling Geoffrey Chaucer in the greatest crime novel setup by a man who can't complete sentences or paragraphs correctly in conversation!?  What in the actual fuck?  Is Trump actually a ghost and only we can see him because we're all already dead in some 6th sense inception-level mindfuck wherein he's already launched the nukes?        \nEdit: Thanks for the Gold, kind stranger!"
'it seems that making it illegal to accept money from lobbyists would go a LONG way towards eliminating the corruption in congress.  in fact, a law making it treason for an elected official to accept ANY money from ANYONE should be the number one thing that could be done to curb the rampant corruption in our government.\n\nelections should be publicly funded, and any outside money should be seen for exactly what it is, a BRIBE, and the punishment should be permanent imprisonment, and loss of any benefits to the guilty party and their family, including their government pension and health insurance benefits.'

"> Stop losing your shit and getting all worked up over things that no one is suggesting will happen. The White House has said Trump has NO plans to fire Mueller.\n\nThey say a lot of things.

'STORY TIME!\n\nOK so I work in proprietary trading. And this was many years ago. It was my first job. Anyway it’s Christmas Eve and my team gets this email from a developer slash trader slash quant at our firm. \n\nThe first thing I notice when I click on this email is that roughly 90% of its contents are in capital letters. Great. What is this asshole droning on about now?\n\nSo I read the email and this guy is SCREAMING at us and asking for something that takes about a year to accomplish (getting all of our servers set up to a GPS time source for you nerds out there). And he wants it done by tomorrow afternoon. This process takes a year because we have multiple locations in different countries. And each one requires we have access to the roof to put a GPS antenna on. And then run a REALLY LONG cable to our computers. The approvals and permits alone take a year. And doing this across the world. With different legal requirements for each country? Yeah.......\n\nRemember how I said it’s Christmas Eve? Yeah. This dude wants us to complete a year long project in one day on Christmas. \n\nHe finishes the email by telling us that if we cannot accomplish this feat by Christmas Day. Then we are all idiots and should be fired and to work at McDonalds. \n\nStill with me?  Ok ok good. \n\nSo about a year after this email incident the guy manages to get fired. On three separate occasions he managed to lose over a million dollars in trading losses in less than 30 seconds. \n\nWe were all ELATED to be rid of this douch canoe. But you see.  No one was more elated than I. I hated this fucker with the passion and intensity of a thousand laser Suns. \n\nSo on my lunch break I walked down the street to the nearest McDonalds. I politely asked for a job application and took that shit home with me. Where I then filled out the name of the application with this assholes name on it. I put it in an envelope and mailed it to this guys home address. \n\nWho should be working at McDonalds now, ya fuckstick?'

">Another was Natalia Veselnitskaya , the Russian lawyer whose June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with Donald Trump Jr. has become a focus of the Russia investigation. She attended a black-tie inaugural party hosted by the campaign committee of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), according to an associate who accompanied her\n\n>In a statement, Veselnitskaya told The Post that she attended a private event in Washington that night at Akhmetshin’s invitation. She added that she did not go to the inauguration and was in the area because she was meeting the next day with an American woman frustrated by the Russian ban on adoptions by U.S. citizens.\n\n>Michael Tremonte, a lawyer for Akhmetshin, said his client recalls that he was given tickets by a person involved in organizing the event and that he invited Veselnitskaya to join him because he knew she was in town. Tremonte said Akhmetshin did not attend any official inaugural events.\n\n>Kenneth Grubbs, a spokesman for Rohrabacher’s congressional office, said the campaign has no record of Akhmetshin’s invitation to the party or of tickets purchased by him or Veselnitskaya.\n\nAs a reminder, Akhmetshin is the one who was with Veselnitskaya at the famous Trump Tower meeting with Don junior, kushner and manafort.\n\nSomehow I'm not surprised the two of them made an appearance at these events at Rohrabacher’s invitation and that Rohrabacher’s office doesn't seem to have any recollection of inviting them. It's so strange that his name keeps popping up and that he has the same kind of bad memory as everyone else who interacts with Russians. Maybe the real story here is that there is an outbreak of amnesia brought upon by contact with Russians. Probably the Clinton's and the other lizard people running the world who are deliberately doing this to frame these innocent patriots in an effort to sabotage Trump and subvert democracy. "

" It's comical almost. trump thinks he's getting off but Mueller is just crossing ts and dotting is. Its so obvious he's guilty and they realistically have to make it convincing enough not to start a civil war. "
"I'm aware of all the theories why he's stepping down now but I'd like to throw this out there. IF a case against Donald makes it to the Supreme Court, i.e. He's a retard, then this guy would have to recuse himself because of the obvious connection to his son. He wants to avoid that mess so he's getting the hell out of dodge. To me this means either we can expect a constitutional crisis with a Trump stacked Supreme Court, or this guy is just old and its all a coincidence. "
"Kennedy's wife has been sick for awhile and he is taking care of her, and for an 80-year-old man/Supreme Court Justice that's a lot of work.   \nI don't like Trump, I don't like the GOP, and I don't like Kennedy's retirement but I'm not ready to jump on the conspiracy train yet. "
"Conspiracy theories don't care about facts."
"The theory goes Kennedy isn't stepping down because he wants to.  He is likely being forced to.  Kennedy's son is in financially in bed with trump and Russians for >10M(he gave trump 10M in Russian backed loans).  So Kennedy gets a call from someone, resign now or your son never comes home, oh and don't sound the alarm on this deal.\n\nThus Russians threatening Kennedy via his son, force him to give their mole trump a swing vote in the SCOTUS. \n\nOh and admitting anything about this threat would link his son in the trump scandal."
"deutsche bank has been under investigation for money laundering (russian money laundering) for quite some time now, the likely hood that this guys son wasn't complicit is incredibly low.\n\nand whether or not justice kennedy had any knowledge or involvement of/in the process, it's going to look really bad for him either way."
'Agreed.  What’s the connection?  Loans?  Really?  Quit being outraged at everything and focus.  '
'Because now is when they can get a young hardline right wing judge in there. If they wait and lose their majority in the senate, then the Dems will likely block any appointment like McConnell did.\n\nWhy would they risk that? '

Had they got rid of Trump before then and you had a President Pence, some might think the main work of getting rid of Trump was done and so wouldn't bother voting in 2018 and you'd end up with a GOP still controlling the house and senate but with a President Pence instead which is just as bad if not worse from a policy standpoint, just not as entertaining as the Clusterfuck that is Trump...oh and the threat off accidentally starting WW3 would have receded I suppose.\n\nHe's absolutely screwed after the elections.

">  When will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. There always playing politics - bad for our country. I want to solve North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, terrorism, and Russia can greatly help!\n\nIn a sense, he's not wrong.  Russia is making North Korea worse by probably providing them with rocket technology to threaten not only all of Japan, but the US also.  Russia is Assad's real ally because Russia cares about nothing but their naval base on the Med.  Russia is 95% of the problem in Ukraine between their theft of Crimea, military invasion of the east and driving crime and corruption in the nation.  As for terrorism, given Russia's drive to cause chaos and disruption among the democratic parts of the world, this would seem to be an admission by Trump that Russia is a key driver of the violence and attacks that kill so many innocent people, including many Americans.\n\nSooo... it sounds like a good rundown of why Russia (not the people, but the criminal operation that controls the country) is such a major problem around the world and for the US.\n\nBut Trump's response is to lick Putin's... er... boots.\n\nWeak.

There were hints of it with the McCain comments but the fact he was willing to go hard publicly against a Gold Star family really was the biggest indicator that he simply did not give a fuck about political consequences. \n\nWhat’s truly appalling is that’s when his base started realizing it too, and prioritized “guy who plays by his own rules” over “Guy who is respectful to the families of fallen soldiers.”\n\nThis was the moment when the Trump Republican base demonstrated that they were willing to abandon longstanding core conservative moral principles in order to stroke the mane rampant toxic beast rearing it’s head in their midst. \n\nAnd to think these fucking people bring veterans into it when talking about putting kids in cages or kneeling football players. Makes me fucking sick. '
'I knew CPT Khan and watching this disgusting display against his family by Orange Hitler reminds me how dissapointed I am in our country.\n\nWe allowed this to happen. Trump should have been eliminated from the world long before we got to locking refugee children in cages.

"This is the exact reason it baffles me when active duty and veterans support Trump.  I just don't understand the logic at all.  I've talked to several of my friends who are veterans and all they say is that Trump supports the troops more than any democrat could, and some stuff about Hillary and Benghazi... but never back it up with anything. As if Hillary being awful makes Trump good.  Isn't it possible they're BOTH awful? \n\n(Btw I don't think Hillary is awful, but I get why conservatives don't like her)"
"It's really astonishing how much people hate Hillary!  "
'The problem is the electoral college. The founders never thought we’d have hyper-dense megalopolises that would skew the electoral weighting processes and end up with not one but *two* presidents (Bush 08 and Trump 16) who did not get the popular vote by significant margins - ~500,00 for Bush and ~2,500,000 for Trump.\n\nThere are no checks on the electoral college.'
"And I naively thought, after he got elected, that he'd be too stupid to do any real damage or even know enough of political game to get anything of his agenda done.\n\nBoy I sure didn't count on the rest of the GOP following behind with a goddamn bag of diapers and a booster seat."

"If you look at the actual contents of the memo, yeah, I suppose Nunes fucked up.  But that isn't the point.  His document scam actually worked very well.  As Mother Jones points out, \n>Noise about the Nunes memo has been deafening since congressional Republicans launched (and Russian bots amplified) #ReleasetheMemo only a couple of weeks ago. The news cycle spun into overdrive with each Trump tweet, each “deeper than Watergate” comment, each attempt by Democrats in Congress to push back. There have been, according to our quick search of the Muck Rack database, more than 3,500 stories on the memo in that time frame, or 233 per day.

"I guess you can give Nunes points for the distraction, but causing a distraction doesn't accomplish much.

"So, as Manafort's various efforts to avoid criminal liability fail, at what point does he begin to contemplate a plea deal? Steele's sources more or less described Manafort as a bagman for the Russians, so what does he know? And is he willing to tell for a reduced sentence?"
'He will lose in VA. too, the Judge there, made a statement critical of Muellers authority, but had not seen Rosesnsteins order either. But while the judge made a point that the trial was being used to squeeze info out of Manafort...duh! In most criminal cases that involved in conspiracies of criminal activities,  the prosecution want to ensure the defendant has a way to cooperate and give needed information back to a case he is investigation often in exchange for a lighter sentence. \n\nBut it can get bad for the defendant when the prosecutor ***knows*** you have particular information, you will not (or cannot) give up.\n\nThe Judge in the Va case, having made the noise that the whole right wing had cheering, will now allow the charges to stick to Manafort, as its all legal.'
'> Manafort had argued that Mueller had exceeded his authority because the case was unrelated to Russian election interference.\n\nSuch an adorable argument.  And T_Dumbass, Trumptards, Actual Republicans, Self-Described Conservatives just keep making it without any intended irony.  It\'s so great.\n\n"Look, if Robert Mueller found dead hookers in Jared Kushner\'s trunk, Mueller could only prosecute the case if *the hookers were Russian*!"\n\nAnd they say these things as if they make sense.  It\'s great.'
'Oh good, it turns out treasonous criminals  are allowed to be prosecuted in America.'
"Why the hell wouldn't he have the right?"
'Yeah, no shit. If the Judge decided anything else it would make for a really murky precedent where you can\'t prosecute for a crime you weren\'t initially investigating for.\n\n>Upp, sorry officer the smell you claimed was "marijuana" was actually "composing dead body." You can\'t bring charges against me for murder or anything pertaining to the body because you were initially investigating for Mary jane!'
'This is what happens when the nation turns out to be Lawful Exhausted instead of  Chaotic Evil.'
"I really do think that Manafort isn't flipping because he's afraid the Russians will kill him."
'Never. The Russians will kill him if he ever cooperates. They’ll probably kill him regardless. I doubt he makes it to trial. '
'The only thing he is contemplating is when to take his capsule.\n\nPossibly in the courtroom like other war criminals'
"No. There's almost zero leverage in an argument that a prosecutor who is prosecuting crimes has exceeded his/her authority. Basically, courts give very wide discretion to prosecutors and the only possible reason to rule against a prosecutor is if he acted for impermissible purposes, such as choosing defendants by race, religion, or political activity. While Manafort's attorneys could have argued the political angle, they didn't—because the court would've demanded proof of animus and there is none."
"Which is why they'll all go to jail forever, because not only did they commit serious crimes against the US(yes, I'm including Cohen in this before he's even been charged bc c'mon) they're committing perjury as well. Fuck Paul Manafort counting on a pardon. Him and Cohen are the dumbest pieces of shit alive (after Trump, of course)."
'My dad says this shit, and my rebuttal has always been "how long does a case normally take to build?"\n\nIn my town, there was a woman driving her car in excess of 120 mph who crashed into the back of an SUV carrying a mother and her 2 daughters who were on their way to the mall. Lady had been evading police from about 15 miles up the road, blitzed through our town (cops had cleared the streets) and then got to the highway intersection, lost control, and understeered her stock sports car (b/c she\'s not a racecar driver) into the rear end of a family and killed 2 people, put the 3rd in a coma for 2 months.\n\nA very cut-and-dry case that took ~1 year to come to court. She was convicted almost immediately, but the fact remains that prosecution takes a while to prepare everything.\n\nIn a situation like we have with Trump, it is likely that they\'re just going to throw the book at him with 100+ convictions or some shit and make sure he goes away forever and setting an example for all future cases in the same vein.'
'> They still can\'t decide whether Manafort is a victim, a friend, or a foe.\n\nThey don\'t care they just will constantly change "facts" to fit their narrative.\n\nIt\'s amazing to me how much the right has this **massive** erection for crime & punishment. "IF YOU CAN\'T DO THE CRIME DON\'T DO THE CRIME HURR HURRR" except when it\'s one of their own then it\'s innocence/deepstate/literally any excuse about technicalities.\n\nLOCK HIM UP ;)'
'In Manafort’s defense (yes I just threw up in my mouth a bit) this case didn’t require an actual defense of his accused actions.  The entire point of this case was to play off of multiple technicalities in order to avoid getting to that actual trial where Manafort had to defend against his accusations.  So pointing out the statute of limitations or that Mueller’s team overstepped their mandate was part for the course on this one... I feel gross now. '
"He's already dead. He just doesn't know it yet. Flip, go to prison, take a pardon, all of them end with a Russian accident. "
'It may even be better in the long run if none of them do. Robert Mueller is no fool - if there is a crime committed he\'ll find it. In other words, Manafort is going to jail forever, regardless of if he flips on Trump or not. Same with Cohen at this stage. I\'d bet you 1000 big ones that Mueller has all he needs to prosecute Trump, with or without their "flipping" on him. In this way (if they don\'t flip) everyone gets to go jail for the maximum amount of time possible. '
'Trump has, publicly, more than allowed for a case of obstruction to be brought against him and the continued attack on the investigation is just more fuel on the fire. '
"As stoked as I am to read this, I doubt it. I hope I am wrong. However, as I've read elsewhere, Trump likely has to be impeached *before* he can legally be indicted by the special counsel. \n\nSo as much as it would be nice to see this blown wide open, if I were Mueller, I would likely be waiting until after the midterm elections when the odds of impeachment go way up. Otherwise you risk not being able to successfully indict him with criminal offenses. Again, I hope I'm wrong, but if I'm not that means it won't be until late 2018 or early 2019 before we really see things really fire up. "

'IANAL: Wouldn\'t this news confirm that Mueller\'s team has evidence of a crime regarding the Russia inquiry?  \n\nAs far as I know, it was a "no-knock" raid.  In order to get a warrant for that, you need to prove to a judge that a crime has been committed.'

"I have a feeling Manafort owes people much darker, and with much longer memories than Trump, and US authorities.  I wouldn't be surprised to see him take prison over flipping if it would mean he could avoid putting his family at existential risk."

'I\'m a lawyer. You\'re in the right ballpark, but you\'re missing some important terminology. To get a search warrant, you need to show a judge probable cause that there is evidence of a crime. Believe it or not, the specific level denoted by "probable cause" is still open for debate in the legal community, but it\'s generally considered to mean that it\'s probable, or more likely than not. As I understand it (I don\'t practice criminal law but I\'ve done a bit of research), you don\'t need any higher level of evidence to obtain a no-knock warrant; you need to show a likelihood that evidence will be destroyed if you execute a standard search warrant.\n\nPut more simply, this confirms that Mueller\'s team was able to show a judge that it was likely Manafort had evidence of collusion-related crimes, and that he was likely to destroy it if they didn\'t get a no-knock warrant.'

'Usually the difference between a subject of an investigation and a target, is a simple piece of evidence. Mueller probably already has that evidence. However, the general consensus among legal experts is that when you are investigating the President of the USA, you do not need one piece of evidence, you need three of four corroborating pieces of evidence, to make him a target. Mueller is building his case from the outside in, gathering evidence against Trumps circle, indicting or flipping them, and slowly working itself inward.\n\nOne of the curious things about the article on he Trump meeeting is that the translator in the meeting is hardly ever mentioned. Its because Mueller is protecting him from any pressure from the press or the right wing press. The interpreter, as part of his practice, cannot divulge what was talked about in the meeting, but Mueller can compel through subpoena or request and most likely Mueller already knows what Manafort may or may not have received in information at that meeting. But the fact that they raided his house and business and was linked to the meeting means that there was something substantial from that meeting. All of the charges against Manafort are leveled to convince him to flip and corroborate that particular evidence, and other pieces.\n\nThe next order of business will be indictments against the hackers of the Democratic Party emails, and anyone caught trafficking in those documents, will be caught up. The emails are considered stolen property, a felony, and those holding those, as a computer files, or trafficking them by offering or asking for them, are co-conspirators and accomplices. What Mueller is doing now, is finding out who knew what and when. Its meticulous work, but these types of investigations become airtight and were the same tactics used by Mueller in prosecuting a the Gambino Mafia crime family. They were professional criminals who tried to be diligent and careful in covering their tracks, Trump and his "family" are clueless idiots'

"Threatening war is my biggest concern right now. When Mueller releases the damning evidence, or right before it, Trump is going to declare war.

Then the ones defending Trump look crazy and lose their power.\n\n\nRight now if they came out and said "Impeach Trump!" they would be out of office by the time impeachment proceedings began. This way is slower, but long term less likely to end in a civil war or with assassination attempts.'
'Talk is cheap. No Republican in Congress has called for the impeachment of trump. in comparison to the Nixon timeline, there were some Republicans in Congress who were clamoring for his impeachment after the Saturday Night Massacre.\n\nWhatever Putin has on the GOP, it is enough to end the party permanently. None of those "trump isn\'t good for us!" shitholes do anything actionable, they still vote with the party, they still support the heinous policies his adminstration puts out. The only reason why they say that shit is to convince people like you that they aren\'t partisan hacks and hopefully get some moderates to vote for them in their mid term elections.\n\nThere is a lucrative business in being an elected conservative in America. If the GOP goes down, then so does the bulk of a market that allied itself with them. Energy, automotives, manufacturing, land & air freight, technology, agriculture, banks, healthcare...it would destroy their credibility and confidence on the global market and probably lead to a recession worse than the one in the 30\'s. Of course to the dumbass GOP, what they dont realize is it is not a matter of \'if\' Putin will release that bomb, but \'when.\' Putin\'s goal has, and always will be, the destruction of America. Just because he helped install a puppet doesnt mean he wont cut the strings when it suits his own interests.'
"Dude I don't understand either. I just keep telling myself that if propaganda didn't work it wouldn't be used.. I'm trying to be inclusive and promote American unity while informing.. I work with a bunch of Republicans and every conversation gets heated so I think I give up on them. It's literally, look at this well sourced information - I'm not reading anything! Or they respond with the latest fox topic or some real crazy shit they got from the internet. And tell me that I can't believe everything on the internet..... I'm the one saying there is a cold war of disinformation being waged do you really think I'm not trying to be careful with my sources?\n\nIt's bad here.

'Because Obama was a media darling who could do no wrong.  He was the worst POTUS in recent history.  '
'Remember when the worst things he did included wearing a tan suit, smoking, and going to mass once with a reverend who was kind of a dick? Those were the days.'
'"Operation Fast and Furious.\xa0In a botched “gunwalking” sting, the Justice Department allowed thousands of guns to be sold to suspected smugglers, in the hope of tracing them to Mexican drug cartels. But the Obama administration lost track of the weapons, many of which later turned up at crime scenes in which\xa0scores of people were murdered. Among the dead: US Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry,\xa0killed by drug gangsters\xa0in 2010. Compounding the scandal was Attorney General Eric Holder’s refusal to turn over documents relating to the operation, a refusal for which he was\xa0held in contempt of Congress.\n\n\nBenghazi.\xa0When Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others were killed in a terrorist attack on the US consulate in Libya in 2012, administration officials falsely blamed their deaths on an irrelevant YouTube video. That wasn’t fog of war,\xa0it was deceit. In public statements, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton attributed the attack to “inflammatory material posted on the Internet.” But in private e-mails to her daughter and the Egyptian prime minister — e-mails not discovered until 2015 — she candidly acknowledged that the Americans had been assaulted and killed by “an al Qaeda-like group.”\n\n**Veterans Administration.\xa0On Obama’s watch, tens of thousands of veterans were denied proper health care at VA hospitals. Their names were added to phony waiting lists and they were stonewalled for months or even years.\xa0More than 300,000 veterans may have died\xa0awaiting medical treatment that never came. According to the Veterans Affairs inspector general, thousands of veterans’ health care enrollment applications were\xa0deleted or buried. Eventually VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned in disgrace.**\n\nNumerous other scandals plagued the Obama administration.\nThe IRS discriminated against politically conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status, placing organizations on indefinite hold if their names contained such terms as “Tea Party” or “Patriots.”\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management suffered a\xa0catastrophic data breach\xa0that exposed the confidential records of at least 10 million federal employees to hackers. OPM’s director had repeatedly been warned that the agency was vulnerable to cyberattack, but had failed to take the warnings seriously.\n\nThe Obama administration, eager to promote “green” energy, lavished more than $500 million in loan guarantees on Solyndra, a high-risk startup. When the company went bankrupt,\xa0taxpayers ate the loss.\nFrom\xa0letting Hezbollah funnel cocaine\xa0into the United States to\xa0secretly wiretapping AP reporters, there were scandals aplenty when Obama was president. The media reported them all, but never with the fury and frenzy that characterize coverage of Donald Trump’s schedule. Obama benefited from being a media darling. Trump, obnoxious and belligerent, practically invites hostile coverage."\n'
'Oh shit!   Checkmate deep staters!!'
'Those are government lawyers, not personal attorneys. Trump literally has teams of personal attorneys dealing with both criminal problems and civil suits.'
"I seriously do not fucking understand how the right has coalesced around Trump even when so many voices amongst their own cry out for reason. \n\nLike, if Trump had been some sort of Bernie Sanders style figure who was championing right-wing policies for the last 30 years and suddenly the party turned on him, okay, but this is a moron who popped up into the party two years ago mostly thanks to being a birther. He wasn't even a Republican years ago. \n\nYet, for some reason, even as the National Review and other conservative journalists, and even present and former Republican politicians, come out against this guy, *they* get thrown aside and attacked. \n\nIt's like watching everyone at a family reunion suddenly embracing a cousin's drunk-ass new boyfriend and telling anyone who criticizes him to go the fuck home. "
'Yeah. Here is the thing. I fucking hate Trump and everything he is and stands for but this story is a nothingburger of a story. SHAMEFUL from what used to be a reputable journal "the Hill"'
'The voices crying out for reason are the core GOP,  or "real Republicans".   \n\nThe people supporting Trump are the crazy people the GOP co-opted during the 1970s (when Nixon brought racists into the fold) and the 1980s (when Regan brought religious nuts in the fold).  \n\nThe Democrats had been in power since the New Deal.  Then the the GOP united the Three R\'s (**R**ich people,  **R**acists,  and **R**eligious nuts) under the Republican\'s anti-big-government banner and had a good few decades from the 1980s through the 2000s.\n\nBut an entire generation of right wing crazy people grew up supported by an establishment that told them their crazy ideas were legitimate.  And like Frakenstein\'s monster they broke free of their masters,  and are lurching half-aware through the public discourse with no clear idea of what is going on.\n\nThe GOP doesn\'t feel that they can tell the crazy people how crazy they and maintain a hold on power.  They are broken.  If Trump hadn\'t won the Republican Primary,  it would have gone to Ted Cruz.  Consider the significance of that.  Trump didn\'t hijack the Republican Primary from the GOP.  He hijacked it from *Ted Cruz*,  who himself hijacked it from the GOP.   That\'s how broken the GOP is.'
"[Even Dick fucking Cheney came out to condemn Trump's plan to ban Muslims.](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/remember-dick-cheneys-words-on-muslim-ban/article/2613309) "
'Yeah, even if Trump could be bothered to understand what this means, what are the chances he has the discipline or the disposition to follow the advice?\n\nTrump\'s the kind of idiot to hear this and decide "Fuck it, I\'m untouchable" and double down on his moronic behavior.'

"No, Republicans are giving us too little credit.  Read the indictment, it is worth the time.  Republicans are in this to the hilt. Russians didn't just launch influence campaigns, they also stole turnout analytic models from the Democrats and stole voter files so they knew exactly which voters to suppress, and then publicized it in the press so that they could communicate with Russians.\n\nThis is a corrupt criminal party and Trump's stupid press conference convinces nobody that he isn't a traitor of the highest order.\n\nTo Restore peace\n\nTrump's tax returns for the past 30 years must be publicly released\n9/11 style commission to get to the bottom of Russian/Republican collusion\nget Gorsich the fuck off the bench\nsuspend any new confirmation hearings for SCOTUS\nMidterms 100% paper ballot verification\n\nAll republicans currently in congress should  have their passports revoked, and be deported to Mexico.

"No, they don't think the Mueller investigation is a witch hunt. They think people like you and the media are conducting a which hunt. Difference is Mueller is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. Media and people seemingly like you only care about digging up any shit on Trump possible (piss dossier, racist property deals, stormy Daniel's, grab em by the pussy, etc) that's a witch hunt. You are looking for a witch and you won't rest till you find one. Muellers investigation isn't that."
'This is what really matters, Republicans couldn’t care less about Russia and the treason of the GOP (even though they were willing to believe every lie about Obama’s...)\n\nWe need to remind Wisconsin about Walker’s shitty policies, about how Republicans hurt the public school system there, and how they destroyed the unions while giving rich people tax cuts which destroyed the State’s economy.'
"Spy? Who said spy? What possible information could she get that the KGB couldn't!? She wasn't there for that, because Russia know how they can bring down the US already. They're nearly finished. She is an undocumented agent of a foreign adversary operating on US soil. I.e. more dodgy (untraceable) diplomat than spy. If she was a diplomat, she would have been expelled. She doesn't have that protection, so will undoubtedly go to jail. It's not the same crime as espionage, but what she was up to is no less damaging to the US. "
'Um, no. People do indeed give a fuck about Russian interference in our elections.'
"You're right it is worse than Joe McCarthy, because the current GOP are absolutely traitors to America, and the evidence is abundant. What's really the worst is that the right-wing base doesn't care if the representatives they elected sell out America to Putin, and that's really sad."
"It's so creepy that you don't care that we've been and currently are under attack from Russia. You're so worried it might cause a hiccup in your ability to kiss up to trump that you're willing to let our nation go undefended against attack. That's so submissive it's disgusting. Have some decency."

"Trump is a living representation of legal abuse and, frankly, the american bar association bloody hates the fucking guy. at this point, the only reason anyone would represent him is because you support him. Unfortunately, this leads to his other problem. He needs a lawyer that isn't horseshit and doesn't rely on money from Fox TV punditry. What Trump *really* needs is a lawyer with a superpower that will convince him to shut the fuck up so he can get a decent plea deal. What Trump *thinks* he needs is a television attack dog. He's just behaving... so. fucking. stupidly. They say that when we get stressed or angry it can reduce your capacity to think critically. We have never seen someone so inept at the basic adult skill of calming down in the oval before."

They know it's evil. And they simply accuse every institution that would keep Trump in check of doing what *they* do themselves.

For the uninitiated, he conceived of Fox as the propaganda arm of the republican party back when he was in the Nixon administration. His writing on it is public. I believe it\'s primarily responsible for the shitty state of politics today. Its viewers do not live in reality, and Fox enables that.\n\nIts secondary mode is to create anger, outrage, and offense. I live in the Houston area, during Harvey we had the news on basically 24/7. Somehow it got switched to Fox and I watched it for an hour or two mainly out of curiosity. Other news was weather/rescue/road information or feel-good footage of pets and people being rescued in boats.

'What are they scared of? They were biting at the bit to release theirs. Seems to me, they should have been released together. I understand the need for state secrets but there needs to be a hell of a lot more transparency in our government!'
'How can someone/some group of people who won the presidency by manipulating information/narratives be so epically terrible at manipulating narratives...Not releasing the Dem memo is as bad of a look as it gets if youre trying to convince people it is a witch hunt'
"We're sorry, but the president is currently involved in treason and this memo makes that more obvious, so we're going to pass for now."
'I’m glad, this whole memo thing is fucking stupid. The pig fucker’s memo was just meandering bullshit meant to appease the shit eaters, and the democrats were just stooping to their level with a “counter memo” that will do nothing but further convince their own base, just as the pig fucker’s memo did.  \n\nTrump denied to keep the memo thing going.  Let it die, Mueller will get to the bottom of it. '
'No surprise. The democrats presented a document that couldn\'t be released in order to cause controversy. Funny. two weeks ago, they were screaming bloody murder that releasing the now-known-to-be pallid "Nunes" memo would be a staggering blow to US gov secrecy. Only an idiot can\'t see through their blatant propgandism'
'> HOW ON FUCKING EARTH CAN THE GOP SLEEP AT NIGHT?!?!\n\nApparently by abusing their spouses. \n'
"This whole thing is a sideshow. We don't need to fall on our swords fighting over a stupid memo. The democrats shouldn't have even made a big deal of the Republican memo, which they had seen and which turned out to be completely devoid of substance. This is their narrative, we don't care about it. \n\nWe should do the same thing we always do. Get Trump indicted. "
'Now he fires Rosenstein. He gives zero shits about how guilty he appears to the non-woke  non-Fox bunch. Sean Hannity is literally telling him to nightly.'
'I mean I was surprised. But mainly because I didn’t think he would pick literally the dumbest option. This whitehouse never ceases to amaze me.'
'Eh, I’m a democrat but it seems likely to me that they would intentionally include stuff that is classified so that exactly this happens or at the least it gets released with redactions. The dems aren’t nearly as bad as Trump, but they still pull political bullshit all the time. We have to be better than the Fox News crowd. We have to know what the fuck we’re talking about before we scream about conspiracy. '
'I was wondering about this. Do it Mike Gravel style (from Wiki):\n\n>On the night of June 29, 1971, Gravel attempted to read the papers on the floor of the Senate as part of his filibuster against the draft, but was thwarted when no quorum could be formed.[68] Gravel instead convened a session of the Buildings and Grounds subcommittee that he chaired.[68] He got New York Congressman John Dow to testify that the war had soaked up funding for public buildings, thus making discussion of the war relevant to the committee.[69] He began reading from the papers with the press in attendance,[68] omitting supporting documents that he felt might compromise national security,[70] and declaring, "It is my constitutional obligation to protect the security of the people by fostering the free flow of information absolutely essential to their democratic decision-making."[70]\n>\n>He read until 1 a.m., until with tears and sobs he said that he could no longer physically continue,[70] the previous three nights of sleeplessness and fear about the future having taken their toll.[6] Gravel ended the session by, with no other senators present, establishing unanimous consent[69] to insert 4,100 pages of the Papers into the Congressional Record of his subcommittee.[40][64] The following day, the Supreme Court\'s New York Times Co. v. United States decision ruled in favor of the newspapers[64] and publication in The Times and others resumed. In July 1971, Bantam Books published an inexpensive paperback edition of the papers containing the material The Times had published.[71]\n\n'
'The problem is that the memo still contains a lot of top secret information, and as bad as Nunes’ conduct as been, it sets a terrible precedent going forward for members of the house to unilaterally read classified information into the record. It would break even more taboos and further alienate the intelligence community from congress. '
'Ya but his followers will only believe that the dems were dumb enough to try and release a memo with classified info to the public. '
"I don't see any reason Team-Trump would leak this list.  The list, like the Comey memos, makes Trump look best-case suspicious and worst-case guilty.  Either we have a rogue operative on Team Trump or team Mueller wanted this leaked.  Personally, I think Mueller had this list leaked via a third party proxy.  He wants the public to know exactly what his questions are.  It gives everyone more than a hint as to what's on the S.C.'s mind and what they're working on."
"This smells of a Giuliani leak.  He's trying to sabotage the investigation."
'The Hill is reporting that Trump leaked the questions, as evidenced by grammatical errors, then tweeted that it is a disgrace someone leaked them.  #wagthedog'
'My money is on Trump refusing to answer any of these questions and just calling them stupid, in the same way that he used to conduct press conferences. '
"It doesn't even matter he's just gonna fucking lie through his teeth and the right will defend him till death. Nothing that Mueller does will have an effect on trump's presidency. "
"Trump aced this test already. He leaks the questions so that anyone else involved knows he they need to contact him so they keep their lies straight, or so that they know he is about to out them.\nHe leaked then to the NYT, a media giant that Trump has criticized.\nAnd then goes to twitter saying Muller's team leaked the witch hunt documents to biased media.\n\nSay what you want about Trump, but that right there, is the art of the deal. His supporters will cling to the fact that the crooked (Hillary) and FBI leak the documents and assume the FBI has no credibility. Also, I feel like he is setting the stage by calling the FBI liars, so that when he lies under oath, he can complain that everyone is lying. Then that he didn't lie, but *they* did. Then, even if Trump did lie, he didn't understand the question so it wasn't a true lie. Then, Hillary lied about her email server, what about Hillary? Then, more excuses and misdirects."
'I like how everyone is already over the Fox and Friends rant. We’re actually at a point where our sitting president can go on a public rant where he...\n\n— Tells many lies about factual things\n\n— Contradicts himself numerous times\n\n— Contradicts earlier statements even more\n\n— Talks in circles\n\n— Repeats himself\n\n— Incriminates himself several times\n\n— Refuses to shut up and essentially has to be forced off the air\n\n... and we’re not surprised. It wasn’t even the top story that day. I’m flabbergasted that all of this is now normal.'
'It\'s actually quite likely that Trump himself (or Trump\'s aides) created and "leaked" said list. Deliberately.\n\nGrammatical errors, horrific prose; it\'s entirely off-handed garbage, not the legal writings of a senior federal agent.'
'Mueller already knows the answer to all these questions... 😎Trump is fucked '
'Somewhere in Looney Tunes, there has to be a sequence where a character is "caught" but freaks out and tries to blame the "catch-er" or claim that the "catch-er" was somehow doing something wrong.  It\'s such a childish reaction, that I feel like there must be an example of it, but I\'m drawing a blank.\n\nThe core thing here is that if the Trump folks had any substantive objection to Mueller having the transition e-mails, they would have immediately gone to a judge and demanded an injunction, which Mueller would have obeyed, if it was granted.\n\nBut the Trump folks have nothing.  They\'ve called it "illegal" but they have no legal basis for that claim or any other objection to the e-mails being turned over.\n\nAdditionally, I\'m sure they don\'t want to challenge Mueller on the transition e-mails because the justification for requesting/having them is that there is ongoing criminal investigation of people in the transition, most of whom are now in the administration.  The evidence and details of that wouldn\'t come out in public, but the Mueller team would clearly state that they had justified the ongoing criminal investigation to the judge, and the Trump folks don\'t want that simple fact confirmed.'
'This points you exactly where you need to look for illegal or unethical behavior.'
"Did anyone see his face when he came out and said his people were displeased but there wasn't anything in them anyway because there is no collusion?  I mean he looks bad, the walls are closing in on him and he knows it.  "
'I was wondering the same. Why is all the "dirt" on these people not used to sack em? Why are they allowed to keep going? If it were some random Stranger he wouldve been jailed instantly  (depending on dirt obviously)'
'Lol the subreddit of butt hurt Clintonites says "staffers tried to sanitize the emails, isn’t that destruction of evidence? It could be construed as obstruction of justice." HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA'
"That's because it's demonstrating that you aren't in charge and it can kill you at any moment, it knows how to end a life."
'Oh shit, are all trump supporters retarded? or is it just the idiots that cry about Hillary day and night that are the full blown retards? '
"Yeah, but the deep State got her off, you know where all the bodies come from from the mass shootings?  the_donald!  First they identify you guys and take over your account, they post that they are questioning something drumpf did, you guys throw them out, and that's it, gone. That's why the crisis actors never speak up, they think it's just an acting job till the deep staters march in with blindfolded trumpanzees and shoot them. Let the actors know it'll happen to them if they speak. The reason Cambridge Analytica recruited you guys is because you are lonely stupid nobodies, and that's why the deep state can take you guys out so easy. Think of all those posters on the_dumbass in the early days, mostly gone now. Is that someone at your door? "
"Not really, that's only checkers level shit, once Mueller gets to 4d chess shit will get real."
'Trump is stupid enough to fire him, no doubt in my mind. Just a matter of how smart his lawyers are / if he is actually listening to them.'
"Um Sir...I don't recal...um my memory fails me. No I'm not a white supremisist! Um Sir...I don't recall..."
"The House Committee is useless and compromised. There's no reason to even have these anymore. "
'How does one attain a lair of evil? And could someone describe the residency there? It sounds quite comfy.'
"Harvard should revoke his degree.  In all seriousness, he's a moron who became a WoW gold farmer which was still more legit than the business he took from Breitbart (I could really start in on the murder conspiracies here) before ultimately giving us Trump as POTUS.  In between beating his wife and not talking to his kids, he's a miserable little shit.  He's a very successful failure at life and endorses horrible things for a profit.  It's a bottom feeding job but some son of a bitch has to do it."
'Nah he is a very very clever guy. Why people think that GS etc hire yokals I will never know. His ideas are bad and perhaps even evil but he is no idiot'
'Yeah, he’s basically your racist drunk uncle.'
"You are such a damn liar. \n\nSteve Bannon doesn't shower- he does a wipe down with some Clorox wipes once a month."
'I was actually thinking the bowels of Hell myself.'
"Nunes is the loon who had to recuse himself after getting involved with a dumb scheme with some Bannonite wingnuts in the Trump White House who have since been removed by Kelly and McMaster.  It isn't the best scenario but I do suspect that the House is doing this to cover its bases.  GOPers tend to be anti-Russia, especially neo-con hawks, so this whole Russia election interference situation makes them uncomfortable."
'Bannon is an evil person.  And the title is meant to be mocking.  Now run along back to the Donald already.'
'He fucked up trying to get Hillary elected.'
'His work is done. Retracting or correcting his bullshit just makes him look weak. All he has to do now is stand by in silence until the cultists start saying, "Are you still talking about that? It\'s old news. WhataboutObamaClintonBenghaziEmailsThough!?!?"'
'The silence from that little whiner speaks volumes. He must be so unbelievably fucked. '
'Nunes has to know hes manafucked when the shoe drops. There is no other reason for this dude putting his neck is so much danger. '
'This was never meant to be a real accusation. Everybody who\'s plugged in, especially Nunes, knows that there was never any basis to this claim.\n\nThe entire strategy here is to insert the idea that there are "two sides" to this. They\'re hoping that just throwing enough vaguely bad-sounding stuff out about this investigation will destroy its legitimacy. Even if a given claim is disproven, the fact that people on TV were even discussing it can be seen as a victory.\n\nEvery goddamn day we weaken the pillars of our democracy a little more.'
'Nunes is waist deep in this shit. He’s trying to cover for his own corruption.'
'Confused here. \n\nThey said there was NOT a spy, Gowdy said the FBI did insert a spy in the campaign just not directed towards Trump. CNN then uses his words to say there was no spy.\n\nSo are you agreeing with Gowdy, saying there was a spy used correctly? Or are you disagreeing with Gowdy and saying there was no spy?'
'They are all full of shit and you know it. I just wished reddit would stop pretending. Impeach, don’t impeach. The status quo won’t change.'
' lol my coworker is a fucking retard who kept saying “WHAT ABOUT BENGHAZI?” Then when I asked him “what about it” he stuttered and had nothing to say except “there was a cover up” lol these people are insane. He goes on to say “just because there are guilty pleas doesn’t mean there was collusion” I continue to tell him that the fbi and cia have confirmed there was collusion so he says yea but Trump didn’t collude his campaign did. I kept thinking like this guy’s a retard. '
"Filet Mignon and Doritos doesn't actually sound like that bad of a meal.\n\nGod, I'm turning orange..."
"The FBI asked an informant to talk to a couple of shady characters who were on the president's campaign staff and see if the evidence of Russian interference checked out. That's not spying, that's investigating crimes. See the difference? If it helps you remember, three campaign staffers have been convicted of felonies and a fourth faces multiple felony indictments. You know, crimes. "
"Yeah, it's so weird that a law enforcement agency didn't want to turn over evidence from an ongoing criminal investigation. They usually love to do that.\n\nOh wait, no they fucking don't. Nunes' actions have been unprecedented and quite possibly criminal, not to mention a clear violation of his oath of office. He's using the power entrusted to him by the people to undermine public confidence in the FBI through half-truths and outright lies - not out of any desire to provide the oversight that is his job, but out of a desperate attempt to forestall a legitimate investigation. \n\nCrazy that the FBI didn't want to help him spread disinformation and otherwise frustrate their investigation, though."
'Because establishment figures want to depress turnout, as turnout threatens their locus of control.'
"The all new 'Deep State Deep Dish Pizza' comes with a sprinkling of black 'ape' hate and extra conspiracy Twitter theories spread by Russian bots."
'Ok good we have the killer and the murder weapon, but we still have to figure out which room it is. I have it narrowed down to the conservatory, the study, or the kitchen but I’m just not confident enough to guess yet.'
"Dirty money is absolutely a crime when it's subverting sanctions against individuals and foreign entities."
'I think a large enough chunk of the American electorate is pissed off enough that they will have to. Besides that, think of how much information Trump has had access to in the past year? He would sell that shit to anyone. The safest place for him to be with our American secrets is solitary confinement in a super max. \n\nDo I as a private citizen have the power to make that happen? nah brah. But Trump has shit on career spooks for over a year, including firing McCabe 26 hrs before retirement. I think it is reasonable to expect there are many in the IC that want him ground in to dust. '
'And now you know why folks refuse to budge on gun control.\n\nThis. Right here. "Conservatives are gunna kill us liburals and stop our takeover, so let\'s seize all weapons!"\n\nEver other non-zealot sees "jesus, the lefties are as insane as the conservatives - we better improve gun rights to defend ourselves against both these sides from seizing our government".\n\n\nDo you get it?'
'Oh we remember.  We also remember when he lied about the info he took from the White House then brought it back to the White House.  He is part of the propaganda machine of this pathetic administration.  The rule of law and the real patriots will win.  '
'I mean he supposedly has assaulted a wife before...\n\n> ["The private account was described in former Newsweek reporter Harry Hurt III’s 1993 book, Lost Tycoon. It details the alleged "violent assault," in which Trump pulled out fistfuls of his ex-wife’s hair after receiving a painful operation on his scalp.](http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-rape-sexual-assault-minor-wife-business-victims-roy-moore-713531)\n\n"Honorable" mention goes to Michael Cohen saying: \n\n>"By the very definition, you can\'t rape your spouse."\n\nBunch of stand up guys we got here (allegedly).\n'
"Does this not count as obstruction? Trying to get an investigator fired with your political pull because you don't like his investigation sounds like it to me."
'> They’re not angry that Mueller is doing his job badly; they’re afraid he’s doing it too well.\n\nRemember, it was Mueller who took down David Petraeus. trump actually considered Petraeus for SecState. I\'m sure Mad Dog and McMasters stepped on that one quickly.\n\nWatch *Frontline*. The 2 current episodes are called *Putin\'s Revenge*. In them, James Clapper states unequivocally that there is definite proof Putin was directly involved with the DNC hack. He says that evidence was shown to Ryan and McConnell, but they "were skeptical". Literally, WTF. This is our worldwide Intelligence agency telling Congressional leaders Russia was jacking us, and they refused to believe it.\n\nAbove all, remember it is a member of the GOP who installed Mueller, and for the party to turn on not only Rosenstein and Mueller, but the DoJ, FBI, and intel is fucking insane. I\'m not given to tinfoil hat stuff, but it\'s apparent that either many of them have something to hide, such as Ryan and Rohrbach, or they are so afraid of losing the power grab they\'ve attained from the 2016 election that our democracy is far down in the list of things they want to hold dear. Damn right, there must be consequences, and those must come in 2018.'
"I'll never understand why trumpers are such bitches about this. If your boy is so god damn innocent then what the fuck are you worried about? Go watch fox and circlejerk about maga. Mueller will be done when the investigation is over, so shut the fuck up. "
"Yes, Fox is at fault for casting the investigation as political. This has been a tactic against Ken Starr and Lawrence Walsh before him.\n\nI happen to think the MSM is at fault here for not accepting the entire WH's word for it that RMIII would not be fired. Trump, Cobb, McGahn, Sanders, Conway and the Direct of Legislative Affairs Tom Short have said they're not considering it. Yet CNN and NBC news is still asking the question in all their analysis. Not cool giving this story fuel."
"This article really undersells what a blatant political hitjob that serial rape enabler Ken Starr conducted. It purposefully and routinely leaked embarassing (but immaterial to the case) personal details to undermine Clinton.  25 years later and it's still serves as a master class in how to violate every ethical standard imagineable. "
'On Reddit I see article after article about the "war on Mueller", what I haven\'t seen is an actual war on Mueller'
'To most of us, this Russsia hysteria just looks like a huge distraction/waste of time \n\nEdit: does anyone remember Reddit before all the shills took over \n\nEdit 2: more information about shilling. This sub is almost completely astroturfed and inorganic \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/\n\nEdit 3: more info about Russiagate. Forensic evidence suggests it was a leak, not a hack https://www.thenation.com/article/a-new-report-raises-big-questions-about-last-years-dnc-hack/\n\n> There was no hack of the Democratic National Committee’s system on July 5 last year—not by the Russians, not by anyone else. Hard science now demonstrates it was a leak—a download executed locally with a memory key or a similarly portable data-storage device. In short, it was an inside job by someone with access to the DNC’s system. This casts serious doubt on the initial “hack,” as alleged, that led to the very consequential publication of a large store of documents on WikiLeaks last summer.'
'Can you really blame them for not believing a word that administration says? How many times have they said 1 thing and then done the complete opposite?\n\nThe pressure needs to stay on that if they fire Mueller there will be consequences. Firing Mueller could have disastrous repercussions.'
"I mean, Ken Starr was a hack. He did such a fucked up job that we no longer have special prosecutors. \n\nLet's not forget, when Ken Starr was investigating the Clintons' private business dealings, Bill Clinton was trying to stop a terrorist named Osama bin Laden from attacking the United States.\n\nSo, yes, Ken Starr is a fucking idiot for not shutting down the investigation into Whitewater as soon as he discovered that there was no wrong-doing. Instead, he went into every aspect of the Clintons' lives and came up with a blowjob. That is political and without his interference in the business of the President, Bill Clinton would have had a better chance of stopping Osama bin Laden before 9-11.\n\nThat's not the same thing as having 2 convictions and 2 more indictments directly related to the primary focus of the investigation."
"Which deranged conspiracy theory is this comment based on? I'm starting to lose track."
'Wait, what? A republican taking the blame? The fuck is this world coming to?'
"Since this kind of thing has leaked before and he denied it, he may be trying to play Mueller and Trump against each other by signaling both  just to see who reaches out and what they offer.  \n\nI think it stinks of desperation, there's no question that he's guilty of something (a lot of somethings), so the question becomes who can reward and protect him best and who has the ability to hurt him worse long term. "
'He’s only willing to talk to prosecutors because the investigation is secretly all about Hillary Clinton! Which is why Trump is trying to shut the investigation down...no that can’t be right. \n\nIt’s politically motivated harassment because it was started and is run by...Republicans? Hold on. \n\nVeselnitskaya only said that she takes orders from Putin in order to sow chaos in the West because Putin ordered her to... something’s not right here. \n\nAh, I got it! The Stormy Daniels contract is fake, which is why the courts should enforce the arbitration agreement in it. I give up. '

'Flip, motherfucker, flip'
'No time to waste get them all and throw them all in the clink'
"Just the fact that he's willing to talk means he's fucked and that raid had some real goodies in it. He'll flip."
"Let's be real; there is no way Trump is getting out of this unless he pulls a dictator move and seizes the government. Trump's family, his business, his cabinet, his business partners, his campaign managers, even his lawyers are up to their neck in money laundering, trading favors back and forth with foreign governments, campaign finance violations, violations of campaign laws aimed to limit the involvement  of foreign nationals in USA elections, misuse of government funds, lawsuits from porn stars, false statements under oath, and some are probably compromised due to blackmail - which, if that's the case, Mueller will have information about. Trump can delay and stonewall all he wants, but these cases are moving forward at the Federal AND State level, and while he could potentially end the Federal probe if he's willing to go full dictator AND if congress doesn't do anything to prevent that (which I don't honestly doubt so long as Republicans are in power), he doesn't have the power to end the state level probes. If Democrats gain congress he'll be gone in a week; this shit with the child interment camps has been the last straw for a lot of Republicans and Independents - they wouldn't rally behind him if Democrats forced him out of office as soon as they gain the Senate and House. Even the Pope has spoken out against mistreating migrants and children."
"It was the same with the Enron investigation. That's how you investigate a large criminal conspiracy: you go after the underlings to build a case against the managers, then you go after the managers to build a case against the top dogs.\n\nThe fact that DT could still be named. Or not. But the fact that he hasn't been named _definitely_ doesn't mean he won't be named."
'No, you’re not alone. My fear all along has been (and still is) that the way this will end is that the Manaforts and Cohens (and some foreign nationals who they can’t bring to justice in the US) will end up in prison and there will be lots of indirect links to Chump; but not enough for a clear criminal case. And the Republicans won’t impeach him just to hang on to power until 2020 (at least). '
'No way in hell Trump avoids New York state prison for a lifetime of money laundering, fraud, etc. '

"Can we just skip ahead to the day Putin decides he's bored with Trump and releases the peepee tape or whatever disgusting stuff he's got on him? "
'["...During the winter of 1861–1862, the Imperial Russian Navy sent two fleets to American waters to avoid their getting trapped if a war broke out with Britain and France.

'"wishful thinking" must mean something different to you than it does to me.\n\nSort of like "conspiracy theory". For me, a "conspiracy theory" would be 7 convictions and many more indictments for "conspiracy against the united states". '
'Or they should just go find an island and make their own country and leave the rest of us the hell alone. '
'r/Keep_Track\n\nPlenty of resources there for ya to ponder. Let’s remember the investigation has not concluded and we only know what has leaked. At a high level just look at who Trump surrounded himself with during the campaign. His campaign chair is looking at hard time for charges related to conspiracy against the US. Let’s wait til the investigation is over k?'
'* This is a 12-day old account.....\n\n* ....filled with politically-triggered binary memes, like the ones you seen all over Facebook before the Mercer-Bannon Cambridge Analyitica scandal erupted *(note: Cambridge Analytica are still operating)*.\n\n* Context of memes are all wrong. This one shows Nigel Farage- the former Conservative leader of UKIP with far-right leanings and is a feverent supporter of Donald Trump. So the context here is all wrong.\n\n* Also, the info on Assange is completely incorrect *(see u/faithle55 elsewhere on this thread)* and simply would *NOT* be handed over to MI5 or extradicted whatsoever.\n\nObviously, the OP has absolutely no idea on British diplomacy, border-regulations or current events. No person is extradicted to another country without legitimate conviction and, if Assange somehow is going to be extradicted, it would to Sweden for charges completely unrelated to current issues implied in this meme.\n\nClearly, this is a Chinese Wumao/Russian troll brigader dropping a fake-fake.\n\nThere has been a heavy rise recently of Chinese Wumao *("50-cent warriors"*) karma-whoring alt-accounts on subs, such as r/aww, r/pics, r/gifs, even r/oldschool and many others. They basically ripping off photos from other people\'s Facebook accounts as well as posting videos from Chinese social media apps, such as Douban (豆瓣*- remember that gif of Chinese locals kicking a water bottle into a moving car???*)\n\nIt\'s happening. This is what they\'ve been building up to- the US midterms.'
'Assange is not, under any circumstances whatsoever, going to be "handed to" MI5. He is not accused of any wrongoing in the UK, **other than** failing to answer bail.\n\nIf he leaves the Embassy, he will be arrested. Since he slunk away last time, leaving his supporters tens of thousands of pounds out of pocket when they had to pay the bail, he will be detained. He\'ll be produced at the magistrates\' court the following morning and if he\'s lucky and particularly if he wishes to plead guilty, he might be sentenced immediately to a few weeks/months in prison. After serving 50% of his sentence - assuming good behaviour - he will be released. \n\nHe will then probably be arrested under the EU restaurant and extradited to Sweden (because all these things have already been decided in court proceedings before he sneaked away to the Embassy) and in Sweden - seeing as he sneaked away from the country while his lawyer was negotiating for him to be interviewed by the investigating magistrate - he\'ll probably be detained there until he can be tried on the remaining sexual assault charge.\n\nMI5 will be like \'thank fuck that slimy git is gone\'.'
'Whatever happened to the rape charges?'
"Wait, shouldn't Assange be extradited to Sweden over rape charges?"
'Oh for fucks sake, this is what Assange banged on and on about when he was being extradited to Sweden too; it just shows a clear lack of understanding of how democracies with an independent judiciary works. In Sweden it is incredibly illegal for any politician to "promise" the judiciary will make a particular decision, and the judiciary can\'t say anything before the actual case is on their docks.\n\nI\'m not sure it\'s the same in the UK but I presume so. That said, Assange should\'ve gone to Sweden at the start. There is no way he could\'ve been extradited from Sweden to the US. Now, when it\'s just the UK? They might.'
'The US have had a hardon for putting Assange in prison for a very long time, he did hack the pentagon among other US government agencies when he was young, imagine a 16 year old kid making US government look like a bunch of idiots by not protecting their stuff. That kind of shit takes a long time to get over.'
"He has been in custody. He got out under house arrest, which he complied to for two years. After two years he still hadn't received a trial or even an investigation, so he fled to the Equadorian embassy.\n\nThe UK to this day refuses to say Assange won't face refoulement to the US, a country who's officials have called for the assassination of Assange. The UN has denounced the UK, Sweden and US for violating Assange's human rights, and demand his release immediately."
"Assange and Wikileaks early on had an image of the impartial information sharing platform, but that ceased to be the case well before the 2016 election, when they pretty much became the disinformation warfare arm of the Russians and thus also, in function at least, the GOP/Trump. For a long time now Wikileaks has released only information hacked from the Democrats, critical of HRC, anything that would benefit Trump, and basically nothing on Russia, Republicans or Trump. Assange is on record, even in a book about the Wikileaks organization itself, on his belief that America is an evil empire that he'd like to see destroyed. If you think I'm dealing in hyperbole, just go research it yourself first. I used to have a positive opinion of Wikileaks, say 2015 and before. Now I see them as a terrorist information organization trying to destroy the country I live in.\n\nI get real annoyed when I see someone acting as if Wikileaks is doing good. They are not our friend. That's assuming one is an American and likes living in a Democracy."
'For years now the UK was planning on shipping Julian Assange to Sweden, where there were suspicions that he would be sent to the US  on unknown charges because he helped reveal warcrimes in Iraq. The suspicions were strong enough that Ecuador agreed to give him asylum, but as he was unable to reach Ecuador, he was simply housed in their embassy.\n\nBy all accounts he was a terrible guest, both politically and in the traditional sense. Ecuador is now demonstrating willingness to expel him from the embassy, at which point he would likely be arrested for violating bail and escaping "to Ecuador."\n\nThe above post is speculating that he could instead be sent to the US through the extradition treaty with the UK, if he were charged with a crime.'
'Fake rape charges? Probably not.'
'Bullshit. Assange is an enemy of the U.S. who wants to see it burn. The reich was conspiring with U.S. enemies (Assange, Russia) for political purposes.'
'It\'s so disappointing and honestly scary that you get downvoted for such a trivial and unbiasedly worded question. And I bet it\'s because it sounds like you\'re disagreeing with the OP.\n\nIt\'s literally gotten to the point where anything politics related is "with us or against us". You dare criticise anything or question anything or even ***ask*** about anything to do with X side then you\'re going to automatically be seen as an enemy of that side. \n\nSubs like these were created to laugh at and condemn this sort of behaviour and yet here we are - the very thing is happening here too. The_Mueller, a parody of The_Donald, is now using the same tactics to squeeze out dissenting opinions and even **questions**. Everyone needs to learn that an ideology, political stance and opinion is never free of criticism. The left-leaning subs should be better than this, especially since most were made to counteract and criticise the actions of a lot of right-leaning subs (and rightfully so). '
'I think Assange is a piece of shit, but extortion does not a great nation make.'
"The United States courts do not recognize censorship. An aggrieved person may sue for damages but the courts will not issue an order barring the printing of a book.\n\nTrump's lawyers know that. This is all posturing for their base because they know their base is too stupid to know better."
'Guys, The Boy Who Cried Fake News says this book is all lies. I guess we better believe him, eh?'
'Listen I hate trump more the any other sane person but we should all take this book with a large grain of salt. The author is a known liar and his “facts” are disputed all the time.'
'There are a hell of a lot of things above that on the list of things Trump needs to acquaint himself with.'
'The guy was only able to write the book because nobody at the White House was checking credentials or restricting guests in any way.\n\nHe literally just hung around there and talked to people.  Trump is terrified because he knows that this guy heard some things...'
"It's also been corroborated. And it meshes perfectly with the view from the outside. And the guy actually was physically there, in the white house, for all of this shit. So if people are saying he's full of shit, then he must've seen what was actually going on but decided not to write about that for some reason. Too boring, maybe? The president was so competent and controlled and smart that there weren't any crises or conflict, so he made up a weird story about an idiot instead. That's probably what happened. /s"
'Devils advocate: it is bs, but the content will be used to reinforce his bad image anyway'
"Does it matter?\n\nHe has no legal traction on this at all.\n\nHe is not a private citizen anymore. I could publish a book tomorrow saying he eats his own shit and he couldn't touch me."
"I think it'd be a dangerous precedent to hold that an elected official forfeits his private rights upon assumption of his public duties. There's no authority for that position currently in the law, anyway. Moreover the cease and desist you're referring to was directed at Bannon, and alleges breach of contract. To my knowledge, no one, on Trump's behalf, has directed Wolff or his publisher to do anything."
"It's crazy how few people are aware they're living through the biggest scandal in modern political history. If the allegations in the Dossier are true (and lots of details from that Dossier have been corroborated), then this is by far one of the biggest scandals in the history of our country."
'> Whining\n\nYou misheard what he said in his stump speeches. Your fault. Sad! \n\nAnd let me stop before you say he was talking about her emails in the run up to the 2016 election. He like buttery males. End of story. '
'I guess the only way out of this mess is through the big blue door. Vote every last republican out of office, try them all for treason and failure to uphold the oath of office.  We should put trump, Ryan, McConnell and all the rest of the republican leadership in prison. and disband the trump/tea party. There are plenty of decent people in the republican party who can rebuild a party that actually follows the law. The next step is to prevent this from ever happening again with a complete irrevocable ban on corporate, union, or wealthy cash bribes disguised as campaign donations. No more PAC or black money allowed, ever. Corporations are not people, neither are unions,  They have no business buying politicians. We need a complete ban on lobbyists bribing politicians to buy their votes. We need to make the maximum allowed by law, $5200 per registered voter, and only from voters in the candidates district/state or local municipality,  no more outside bribes to buy politicians and screw over the American voters. This is our country and we want it back.'
"The only way out of this mess is to vote those who would give Trump political cover out.   Unless that happens, nothing will change.   Help us Mueller Wan Kenobi....you're our only hope."
'Exactly!! Plus, anyone that would make these comments is racist (objectively speaking), and should add to the impeachment reasoning: \n\n["Part of the problem with young men of color is oftentimes the only thing they see to be passionate about is basketball or rap." ~Trump](http://breakingbrown.com/2014/07/obama-black-boys-are-only-passionate-about-basketball-and-rap/) \n\n["You cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin\' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I\'m not joking." ~Trump](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1895156_1894977_1643323,00.html) \n\n***Edit @ T+2 Hours:*** We\'re sitting at 12 upvotes and clearly no one has clicked the links to realize the first quote is by Obama and the second by Biden. You just called your own side objectively racist. Good job.'
'Impeachment will never happen with this weak ass congress'
'[dramatic rant]\nWell hey, our collective nation has gotten really good at turning a blind eye to its own implosion. I mean, school shootings are just the norm now, college debt ruined an entire generation, and Trump can do whatever he wants and got elected friggin president! What’s next? Putting 2 year old kids on stage dressed in bikinis and calling it a “beauty pageant”?! Oh wait, that’s real too. How about we overmedicate everyone and rob them blind for healthcare? Oh wait, that’s real too. \nI couldn’t write fiction as strange as our truth.'
"While I totally agree that it should end a career, and that this happens with sickening regularity with Trump, I would caution against phrasing like this. Other politicians have had major scandals that should have probably brought them down, but didn't. \n\nE.g.\n\nRegan and Iran contra\n\nClinton and being impeached for Purjury. \n\nObama's fast and the furious scandal was pretty bad. (He was saved by asserting executive privilege on that one. Arguably he used it less than Bush, but still.)\n\nAndrew Johnson's Impeachment was quite the hubub. He fell one vote short of being kicked for violating the law.\n\n\n"
'It is because it takes a long time for Mueller to collect, collate and file the countless reports to build an iron-clad case.\n\nIf he were to say "Okay that will do for now" he wouldn\'t be doing his job properly. I guess it could take years - perhaps that is what Trump is banking on.\n\nYes, another week another scandal. But take heart: our impatience and worry about the apparent delay in all of this must be miniscule compared to the paranoia and anxiety Trump must be feeling every second of the every day.\n\nIt is probably a good time for him to consider starting drinking.'
'Standards, norms, morals, and values don\'t apply to Republicans and haven\'t for a very long time. They will always be able to get away with things as awful as this on a constant basis. They will never follow their own arbitrary "rule of law" that they establish for everyone else but themselves, and will do anything to get away with it. At this point, something drastic needs to be done, to stop the US turning into Russia, or Turkey, with all the corruption and loss of human rights.'
'The normalizing is the worst part about trump. We’re beyond the slippery slope. '
"Not surprised, we normalized and accepted Bush's, Obama's, and Hillary's scandals. /s\n\nBut seriously, I've never seen a party go after it's own president, it's always taken the opposition party coming into power for consequences to get dished out."

She knew that people were judging her, she knew it was completely factual, and she couldn't laugh because she knew how much more evil she'd look; so she just attempts to appear unimpressed and bored. Lol I hope the laughter haunts her for the disservice she provides humankind."
"Yes. But, at the risk of being downvoted, I'm going to point out that it's not her job to tell the truth per se, it's her job to say what the White House tells her to. When the subject is a matter of national security I accept that the person holding her position can't tell the truth all the time. \n\nWith this administration, though, we're seeing the worst case scenario of what happens when the president is corrupt.  She lies because it's not her job to tell the truth but to deliver the administration's message, which is mendacious as fuck. \n\nAll that said,  a person with a conscience would quit, so I have no pity for her.

It is like those people at work who always say its not their fault and actually believe it after the years the more they tell it. They also don\'t feel like liars, they just "bend" the stuff so that it looks good but they dont even see it as bending, they are just seeing it "how they think it is". Understanding mentally challenged people is hard, even if its very "low-profile", it modifies the view of the world  combined with the limited amount of people she probably has contact to, increases her "fantasy about reality".

'Because one side always likes to pretend to be victimized whenever somebody criticizes them in a civil way. I have seen it a thousand times from a thousand politicians.

"that's weird he said prison... prison is reserved for individuals ~~convicted of felonies~~ *sentenced to longer than a year*. How would he be sent to prison and not just jail without bond?\n\nedit: just saw the actual quote said jail. This is correct. Also, he better go to jail.

As soon as any of these f'ers are convicted, they need to be reindicted in New York, ESPECIALLY Trump.\n\nEdit: I wanted to edit this to clarify something: *I don't think double Jeopardy should be removed.* I do, however, think that in the case of jurisdictions overlapping, the state should have some recourse.\n\nAnd it turns out that it does. I was [reading up on dual sovereignty](https://www.law.cornell.edu/nyctap/I07_0102.htm), and it seems this ground is well-trod.

Thrown in jail on a misdemeanor for committing a criminal traffic offense, without bond.\n\nThis guy is out on bond on multiple felonies, and committed a serious felony directly related to those prior felonies. If he doesn't get his bond revoked it will be a huge slap in the face to every other person who's seen the inside of a criminal courtroom.\n\nI would safely bet $500 he gets his bond revoked. The only chance he has is if the prosecutor is somehow unable to produce the evidence needed.\n\nThe only thing I want to know is why hasn't he been arrested on the witness tampering allegations yet. Once/if he is, there is 0% chance he gets out until his sentence is served. A criminal report affidavit/probable cause affidavit with sufficient evidence of a new law offense while out on bond is a defacto and numerated reason to revoke a bond."

Aside from a small handful of outspoken congressmen, it’s radio silence on all of this insanity. The Mueller investigation might not be done for a long time yet and it feels like we are just sitting around waiting to see how bad it can get. That doesn’t give me much hope. That along with the propaganda problem we have in addition to the infiltration of conservative billionaire influence, finding out if Trump worked with the Russians seems a bit moot at this point anyway. We all know he did.  The evidence is out in the open. Collusion, obstruction of justice, money laundering, we have seen it all. Nothing seems to matter. It’s enough to make me think I’m the crazy one. '
"The low ethics and corruption aren't part of Mueller's investigation (so far). He was tasked with investigating Russian interference with the 2016 election and any crimes uncovered in the course of that investigation. If during his investigation, he uncovers incriminating communications (such as telling foreign governments to launder campaign funds theough the NRA or a quid pro quo bribery deal) between Trump, the Trump Campaign, or one of the people associated with the campaign or administration with anybody else then that would become part of the investigation. When you're investigating such corrupt people, you're bound to have a lot of avenues to investigate. Everything you find that looks fishy, has to be fully investigated. \n\nCurrently, it's the job of Congress and the Department of Justice to oversee the Trump administration's compliance with laws and ethics. Sessions isn't really interested in doing that. He's more interested in pursuing his long held anti-immigrant and anti-minority policies. The Republican Congress isn't interested in acting as a brake on the worst instincts of Trump or his appointees because the Republicans in charge are scared of Trump tweets and they're getting what they want for now. There will be no meaningful oversight of the Trump Administration until Democrats have control of at least one chamber of Congress."
"They've also infiltrated the online African American community. A couple months ago it was discovered that dozens of online activists were actually Russians sowing discord and discouraging people from voting Clinton by stirring up resentment. And that's just the ones that were caught. \n\nSo on one hand you've got Russians stirring up racists, and on the other you have Russians stirring up the anti-racists. \n\nIt was not pretty."
"You're right. I don't see what this nothingburger is all about. \n\nIts hard for me to see any Trump ties to Russia—I mean, except for the Flynn thing and the Manafort thing and the Tillerson thing and the Sessions thing and the Kushner thing and the Wray thing and the Morgan, Lewis, & Bockius “Russian Law Firm of the Year” thing and the Carter Page thing and the Roger Stone thing and the 198 Million voter records thing and the Felix Sater thing and the Boris Ephsteyn thing and the Rosneft thing and the Gazprom thing and the Sergey Gorkov banker thing and the Azerbajain thing and the “I love Putin” thing and the Donald Trump, Jr. thing and the Lavrov thing and the Sergey Kislyak thing and the Oval Office thing and the Gingrich/Kislyak phone calls thing and the Russian Business Interests thing and the Emoluments Clause thing and the Alex Schnaider thing and the hack of the DNC thing and the Guccifer 2.0 thing and the Mike Pence “I don’t know anything” thing and the Russians mysteriously dying thing and Trump’s public request to Russia to hack Hillary’s email thing and the Trump house sale for $100 million at the bottom of the housing bust to the Russian fertilizer king thing and the Russian fertilizer king’s plane showing up in Concord, NC during Trump rally campaign thing and the Nunes sudden flight to the White House in the night thing and the Nunes personal investments in the Russian winery thing and the Cyprus bank thing and Trump not releasing his tax returns thing and the Republican Party’s rejection of an amendment to require Trump to show his taxes thing and the election hacking thing and the GOP platform change to the Ukraine thing and the Steele Dossier thing and the Sally Yates can’t testify thing and the intelligence community’s investigative reports thing and the Trump reassurance that the Russian connection is all “fake news” thing and the Chaffetz not willing to start an investigation thing and the Chaffetz suddenly deciding to go back to private life in the middle of an investigation thing and the appointment of Pam Bondi who was bribed by Trump in the Trump University scandal appointed to head the investigation thing and the alfa-bank thing and the VEB thing and the The White House going into full-on cover-up mode, refusing to turn over the documents related to the hiring and subsequent firing of Flynn thing and the Chaffetz and White House blaming the poor vetting of Flynn on Obama thing and the Poland and British intelligence gave information regarding the hacking back in 2015 to Paul Ryan and he «didn't do anything» thing and the Agent M16 following the money thing and the Trump team KNEW about Flynn's involvement but hired him anyway thing and the let’s fire Comey thing and the Mueller let’s fire him too thing and the Election night Russian trademark gifts thing and the Russian diplomatic compound electronic equipment destruction thing and the let’s give back the diplomatic compounds to the Russians thing and the let’s back away from Cuba thing and the donny Jr met with Russians thing and Trump's secret second meeting with his boss Putin thing and the Steve Bannon telling the world the Trump Tower meeting was “treasonous” thing or the Russian Oligarchs attending his inauguration thing or the Alex Van Der Zwaan indictment or the Rick Gates plea deal thing or Hope Hicks resigning after congressional testimony thing or the Erik Prince Seychelles back channel to Russia thing or the Michael Cohen lying about Prague, bragging about Russian mafia ties, or taking money from Viktor Vekselberg things or even Trump’s lawyers admitting Trump dictated his son’s public response to the Veselnitskaya meeting he “didn’t know anything about”.\n\nTotal crazy conspiracy theory."

My guess is that the FBI team has been waiting it out, knowing that eventually, Bannon would fall out of favor, and would then be more willing to squeal. Bannon is washed up at this point: his donors have cut him off, and the far right/alt right falls in with trump at the end of the day, so he doesn’t have much to lose by talking.'

In short, transparency reduces the efficacy of political advertising. So when billionaires want to do shit like restrict their waterfront property in Montana so only \\*they\\* can use the water, and flood local elections with a shit ton of money to get those regulations passed, but have to declare that they\'re the ones funding the bills, people don\'t gobble that shit up like they do if something is funded by "Americans for Prosperity" or any of the other number of Koch Brother shell companies they use to try to castrate the government'

'Yeah, that would just be more "sticking it to the liberals". \n\nThe one and only thing that would make Trump piss his pants in fear is everyone finding out he\'s deeply in debt to the point of having no money. \n\nHe\'s more likely living on Russian credit, juggling projects around the world that exist solely to launder money. Otherwise why would he be running his little 100k here 100k there grifter schemes while president. He can\'t stop grifting for cash flow in the hopes of staying afloat.'
"Why is it such a popular theory that Trump can be blackmailed by any negative footage caught on tape? After this last year and a half, it doesn't strike me that he would give one single shit if video surfaced of him raping a literal baby. He would do what he does, distract and obstruct and lie and his base wouldn't care, they would think it was sabotage and fake.\n\nI definitely think Trump is compromised but it really doesn't seem like a pee tape would dictate any of Trump's actions, let alone all of them."

"I guess if you ignore the illegal meeting with Russian criminals in Trump Tower to get the Maginsky act shut down, then yeah, no benefit to Russia at all...\n\nBTW, the US Congress passes a law with new Russian sanctions, and Trump has violated his oath and not faithfully executed the laws of the United States by not implementing them.   That's a CLEAR benefit, to the detriment of the United States.\n\nBut Republicans are cowards, and won't impeach him.   Which is fine, because Mueller's got a fine criminal case rocking and rolling, getting pleas and convictions and putting criminals in prison.   The GOP should have vetted Trump better, given all this criminal liability appearing.\n\n**Trump last month:**\n\n**Well, you’ll have to ask Michael Cohen.

"Well, yeah, when there's a conspiracy, then you have theories about them.  It's only when it's a CRACKPOT theory that it's an issue.\n\nFor example.  The preponderance of evidence in Doe v.

'Fuck that scumbag motherfucker'
'Highly recommend listening to the podcast “Knowledge Fight”. Basically they attack Alex point by point, fact checking all his bullshit and pointing out the aspects of Alex that he tries, and fails, to hide. Honestly if more people listened to it, Alex could be put in jail with the right kind of push. He’s admitted on air to having been interviewed by “high level Russian operatives” who asked him if he worked for the government and told him Putin watches the show (purely to gauge how effective his divide and conquer strategy is going I assume) and he never talks about disclosing any of that to the federal government like you’re supposed to. If true then Alex is a traitor and essentially a spy. But he doesn’t know it cause he’s a moron and thinks Putin is sucking his dick for any other reason than “I’m a mouthpiece for Russian propaganda.” It’s pathetic really. I mean it would be if it weren’t eroding the foundations of our country. \n\nIf there is another American Civil War, history books will point to Alex Jones as the moron who cracked the door open for Putin to come in and fan the flames of the Alt-Right.

He pleaded guilty to one count of receipt of stolen property and testified against Lazarenko, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office's for the North District of California. Kiritchenko's daughter, Lidia, paid $1.25 million for a unit in Trump Tower II in 2013, acording to the Miami-Dade Property Appraiser.\n\nEduard Nektalov, a Uzbeki diamond dealer was arrested on charges he laundered drug money before he was killed in New York, according to multiple news reports. He purchased a unit at Trump World Tower for $1.6 million in 2003, according to the New York City Department of Finance.\n\nThe Sivokozov family, which has ties to organized crime, according to various Russian media reports. Patriarch Vasily Sivokozov was director of a Russian bank whose license was revoked, according to the reports. His son, Igor, went into business with a Russian-American criminal who had been convicted of fraud. Igor Sivokozov and his daughter, Natalia, paid $660,000 for a unit in Trump Royale in 2015 though the assessed market value was $483,223. Natalia Sivokozova bought two units at Trump Royale, one in 2015 for $675,000 — which had an assessed market value of $534,630 — and another for $1.3 million — which had an assessed market value of $923,803 — in 2016. Her sister, Ksenia Sivokozova, paid $675,000 for a fourth unit in 2015, though it had a market value of $474,474.\n\nBurman, who does not have a medical license, opened six clinics in Brooklyn as part of a scheme to defraud Medicare and New York State Medicaid programs of more than $26 million between 2007 and 2013, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. It was during that time in 2009 that he paid $725,000 for a unit at Trump Tower I in Sunny Isles Beach, according to the Miami-Dade Property Appraiser. Burman, who was born in Kiev and came to the U.S. in 1992 , pleaded guilty and, in May 2017, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. \n\nZeldovich, who according to social media is likely from Minsk, Belarus, had a company accused of violating anti-monopoly laws and may have continued to do business in Crimea, despite U.S. prohibitions about doing business there after Russia annexed it from Ukraine, according to Russian news reports. Zeldovich and his wife, Erna, purchased two Trump Place units in 2007, one for $790,000 and another for $995,000, according to the New York City Department of Finance. They spent $750,000 for a Trump Royale unit in 2008, making them one of the first buyers, according to the Miami-Dade Property Appraiser. Zeldovich Living Trust, which lists Zeldovich as a representative , spent $1.85 million on a unit at Trump Place in 2010, according to the New York City Department of Finance.\n\nRomashov served as chairman of the board of Transoil when it was on the Treasury Department’s sanctions list in March 2014.

"How are you guys legit this delusional?\n\n1. Comey literally lost the election for Clinton. He publicly announced that the investigation was reopened like a week before Election Day for fucks sake. How do you even remember to bathe with memory this poor? This was like a fucking year ago. Muh bias.\n\n2. Trump ostensibly had comey fired because he acted in a way that arguably lost Clinton the election. That's what I love about this, you idiots are so brain dead you don't even actually know the supposed reason the DOJ fired him. You think it's because comey was biased *towards* Clinton, when in reality Trump is arguing the opposite. But you fuck nuts literally do not comprehend shit, so in your mind it's because he was biased towards Clinton. Fucking. Imbecile.\n\n3. Witch hunt? Lmfao. 4 indictments and 2 pleas dipshit.\n\nCan I be real with you? Why are you guys so fucking delusional and stupid? Honestly. Do you not remember cheering for comey a year ago?

The Democrats saw an opportunity after they lost the fight against civil rights to earn a huge voting bloc in minorities and jumped on it. \n'
"We're fucked. The Democrats are almost as bad"
'Democrats were the reasonable ones in 2008 too. Pubs are worse than ever now, but the difference between now and the "birther" days isn\'t as wide as some might remember.

'The campaign message from democrats needs to be how they are different from republicans.  Simply disparaging the opponent does nothing to help because republicans will say democrats are exactly the same, but worse for having trying to pretend they are different.\n\nDemocrats need to be on the same message and same page for a campaign: "Here is how the democratic party is different: "'
"Yes I wish there were not then 2 viable parties as well, but there is only 2 parties and for the entire history of the USA there has only ever been 2 viable parties and that's due to the first past the post system. Want change in a party we gotta get involved lower levels. Primaries is where you make change and not just presidential primaries. Congressional, senator, hell school board primaries"
'Wait, that\'s not a "false equivalency". That\'s objectively true.  I don\'t have any problem with a Republican of today, who has a functioning conscience, lamenting that the GOP of 2018 is an embarrassment to the proud history of a Republican party that opposed slavery at the time that it was actually going on.\n\nIt\'s a thought process that makes sense: "Wait, how did we go from \'free the slaves\' to \'lock up the immigrant children\'? in about 150 years?"'
"When the political landscape is taken over by evil, the biggest priority becomes opposing it. Until they are defeated for good, anything else literally doesn't matter.\n\nThe Democrats could support lower taxes, higher taxes, neoliberalism, socialism, conservatism or whatever, and it wouldn't matter. Any ideology that at least acknowledges the sanctity of human dignity and the political process.\n\nOnce civilization is back where locking babies into cages is outside the Overton window, we can resume arguing about the details."
"Yes.  That party.  That party, and the things you just listed are literally better people, leaders, politicians, and options than the Republican party by miiiiiles.\n\nThat's where we are.   And a good reason for it is because the Republican party has fought tooth and nail for 40 years to not only stop progress, but to make things worse.  To keep corporations and the rich in control, to ignore the environment, create and maintain the drug crisis, support terrorists, knock down democratic governments, remove safety, environmental, and business regulations that protect the masses, tear down civil rights,  control the vote, obstruct and prevent affordable and sufficient education.\n\nIf the D party is half as bad as it is, it's partly because their opponents made sure that efforts and resources were constantly wasted on their own missions.\n\nAnd yet, in comparison to the monsters on the Right, with its kleptocracy, water poisoning, environment killing, social safety net destroying, racist obsessions, they are a million times better.

Why not openly say something like "so he\'s bounced a few ex wives around, so what? we aren\'t paying him to be a boyscout at home" and move on?\n\nThe reason, of course, is that it\'s a big deal, others have explained why with a lot of detail, but keep asking yourself this question: if it\'s not important, why lie about it?

"Two things here...\n\n1)Bannon was subpoenaed by Mueller last month and reportedly made a deal with the special counsel to not testify before a grand jury.\n\n2) Bannon made an appearance before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday but refused to answer questions that weren’t pre-approved by the White House, lawmakers said afterward.\n\nMy interpretation of these two things...\n\n\n1) Bannon gave up Trump and everything he knew about anything.  You don't get immunity from testifying in front of the Grand Jury for nothing.  20 hours?    They gave him a fucking grilling and now know everything he does or thinks he does.  OR they told him he didn't have to testify before the grand jury because they already have him cold and are gonna fuck him up his fat bitch ass, hard....with a cactus.....covered bulldozer.  They traded testimony with the Grand Jury for letting him lie so they could indict him too.\n\n2)The tubby lunchbox is still trying to maintain some bit of credibility about his loyalty with Donnie Moscow.\n\nCongress can cite him for contempt and put Bannon in prison for maybe a few weeks tops before his lawyers pull some bullshittery and get him out.    Mueller can send him to fucking rape-in-the-ass prison for the rest of Bannon's miserable life.   Who do you think he's gonna roll over to?\n\nWhat I find almost humorous is Bannon's transparent attempts to cull favor with Trump, by falling in line in his appearance before congress.\n\nI wonder what Bannon told Trump he talked about with Mueller's team for 20 hours?   How Trump and his gang of rat-fucking traitorous sellouts didn't conspire with the Russians all those times?"
"Yet, he plead all kinds of weird privilege to the HIC. Is this Mueller's doing, telling him to stfu in fear that Dunes will do something, or is something else going on? Rep. Swalwell was just on Hayes calling for contempt of Congress against Bannon. Is it just people being on different pages? Do I, personally, need to get an attorney???"

'Why is it so impossible to belive that he won because of lacking competition? The only reason why Obama became president was because he was 50% Black democrat in 2008. Hillary Said herself that she should win just because she is a woman.

Whether you believe everyone is entitled to healthcare or not, the finances don\'t lie.

You\'re comparing a man with plenty of money for campaigning, against a man who had many factors stacked against his odds. Now the next step is to forget about being politically correct, and focusing on the bs that\'s going down behind the curtains. Obama may have not been born in the USA, but no one ever had the grounds to even accuse him of collusion or adultery. He was, in character, a respectable human. You may not agree with his decisions while he was in power, but describing him as a human being, you likely will not think of a strong case against him as a person. Many things can be said about Trump and his wealth. He has gotten away with a PLENTITUDE more than most presidents of any color, ever could have gotten away with. President Donald Trump being charged with a fine for a crime or repulsive scandal or even saying "...grab them by the pussy...", was once eloquently placed from out of text as crime being "...legal for the rich."

'Most people aren\'t reading the news and digging for details on the internet. I get the feeling that most of the country is getting frustrated that the investigation is going on so long with so little insight into what the investigators know. Unfortunately, that\'s just how this shit works. We get clues from witnesses talking after the fact and from the indictments that have dropped and subsequent filings, but we don\'t really know what\'s going on inside Mueller\'s camp, because, unlike the raging dumpster fire at the WH, Mueller\'s team are professionals. Also, with Cheeto Benito constantly attacking the investigation and Faux News pumping out the "unleashed and unhinged" narrative, it\'s inevitable that the news-lazy masses are going to see more of one side than the other. Don\'t worry: serious people are quietly working and if Trump starts feeling his big-boy oats and decides he can get away with firing Rosenstein or Mueller, I am confident that contingency plans are in place.

Ignoring the subpoena altogether to say (essentially) “she got off easy, we want to get off easy.” He refuses to say Trump is willing to go under oath, explicitly stating that they want to be (paraphrasing) “not under oath”, “with pre-screened questions” rather than responding to a subpoena.\n\nIn OP video, Giuliani claims a president “has no choice” and “has to” answer a subpoena. In your video he states Trump won’t unless it’s specifically on his terms (never mentions “unless we’re forced by a judge” like you claim). These are contradictory statements, and one can presume it’s because Clinton was a D and Trump is an R.'
"Guliani literally fucked and married his second cousin. His explanation for doing so was that they didn't find out they were related until after they married. Rudy Guliani is literally a cousin fucker. Trump just wishes he could fuck Ivanka. That's why he always compares other women he wants to bang to her. Disgusting for regular people. A plus for his base, makes him more relateable. "

'Impeachment has never been the goal. These charges end with millionaires in prison. '
'I like how that article starts by talking about how Hatch basically thinks that firing Mueller would be bad and could/should/will get the President impeached, but then quickly shifts into “oh just because Hatch thinks bad things will happen if Mueller is fried doesn’t mean he’s going to do anything to help protect the investigation.”\n\nThis is the worst season of every TV show'
'Fuck Orrin Hatch, the time to speak out was over a goddamned year ago before you used this carnival to pass your garbage tax bill.'

'Never trust republicans. I don’t trust a single one of them. And honestly I don’t even trust Robert Mueller, although I’m hoping I’ll be pleasantly surprised. \n\nAt this point, our best chances imo are Avenatti and the DNC lawsuit. \n\nDO NOT TRUST REPUBLICANS. EVER. DONT TRUST THEM. THEY WILL FUCK SHIT UP. THEY ARE SNAKES '
"McConnell is a traitor and has no fucks to give for impeaching his wife's boss."
'From Trump’s perspective:\nDon’t fire Mueller is definite impeachment and possible prison.\nFire Mueller and it is possible impeachment.\n\nWhy is everyone trying to stop me firing Mueller? Nobody understands. SAD!'
'Beating dead horse if he was going to fire him he would have done it by now'
"Fake news. Fake sub. Can't wait for the revolution. "
"Problem is Donald has no competent legal minds in his corner.  He's not sure what he can and can not do.  Mueller is actually playing chess and every move Donald makes counts.  He's scared to fire Mueller because he sees that it's a trap.  He sees no way out, and there's no one smart left at the table except maybe Giuliani [who understands RICO law, but whom I suspect is only trying to cover his own ass]."

'1. Trump visited LV on Oct 30  Are there records of other payments to the hotel for that trip? Are they in line with the market rate for however many rooms he needed? Do campaigns normally pay in advance for stuff?\n2. What happened in DC? Anything?\n3. Why do two hotels not have locations...\n4. How many sets of transactions can we make that come out to about 130k?\n5. This doesn\'t jive with his lawyer complaining he didn\'t get paid.\n6. Can we stop and appreciate that Trump\'s campaign enriched his properties by about $120k in a single day? In a campaign  he allegedly never intended to win? This looks like a scam to funnel donations into his business "empire". I wonder how much money went i to his own organization.'
"TLDR: Man in power with money abuses it?\n\nNow, imagine if world leaders only used crypto to pay for things they didn't want the public to know about. I heard Kim Jung Un gathered quite a bit of Bitcoins and I heard Trump is going to meet with KJU soon... :3"
"I disagree. Apparently no one gives a shit about the other obviously illegal stuff. So we have to highlight clear ties to a porn star b/c perhaps that will tickle GOP and press sensibilities where simple crime doesn't."
"It's worth noting that Susan Simpson has been proven to be a liar in the past. She was one of the parasites that glommed onto the Serial podcast phenonenon. She joined the team that was trying to free the subject of the podcast who had been convicted of murder. There was a period where her team of low-lifes were among the only people who had access to the case files, and during that time they selectively leaked the contents in a way that looked good for their point of view. It was truly disgusting. Eventually, some members of r/serialpodcast got the case files themselves and soon demonstrated how dishonest and deceptive she had been. Long story short, I hate Trump as much as anyone here, but you don't want this liar on your team. "
'Honestly, in the situation with this President, we should be critical of claims against him but we should not give him the benefit of any doubts.\n\nSo right here, instead you should criticize that there is a big missing link in her logic.  Trump Campaign -> Trump Organization properties.  EC LLC -> Stormy Daniels.  Where is the Trump Org -> EC LLC?\n\nI doubt she intentionally wrote that as a means to persuade by means of confusion, but her statement *was* confusing and it took some re-reading to determine that there was no purported Trump Org payment to EC LLC.  So this is coincidental, but far from the smoking gun like any payments to EC LLC from Trump or his campaign or businesses.'
"There have been multiple sources that have said that his goal wasn't to win but instead set up a trump TV after the election. After all it could be filled with perpetual anti-Hillary content. However the only source I think one needs is the look on his face the night he won. That is the most miserable man to ever win the presidency. "
"No one is claiming that there wasn't more money though. This is what money laundering looks like. You bury your clandestine transactions (which are themselves broken up into smaller chunks so as to appear less suspicious and searchable) amongst legitimate ones. It deserves to be looked at is all anyone is actually saying. \n\nIf it's a red herring, it's a red herring. If it cannot be explained sufficiently, than it deserves to be dealt with. "

'I’m struggling to remember what was going on back then. I know the investigation started July. I know the hacks happened. But this was June. I thought shit didn’t come out until later. Why did trump say Russia? How did he know to say Russia at all? '
'Dude told lady to "be quiet". How fucked up, disrespectful and condescending is that?'
"Also I don't know if trump knows that a British civilian has Is it been killed by Russian chemical attack. On purpose  or not doesn't matter. And it seems to be getting glossed over everywhere. Imagine if an American person and been killed by the Russians in America would trump still be there best mate ?"
'The pieces are all starting to fall right into place. The hubris and arrogance of these criminals, starting with the orange pig at the top and working its way to McConnell who allowed this to happen and the coward Ryan who has betrayed his country. The Republicans, en masse, have utterly betrayed their country. Traitors, one and all. '
"One conspiracy washing another. It is the result of our government's biased actions towards the left. "
'If it was real, it would have been released. The problem is, the whole dossier was a fake. John McCain and others will be going down for it if he lives long enough.  Follow the truth. The problems lie in both parties unfortunately.  '
'Well this speech was on July 27th not June. I thought I remembered Russia talk just starting to become a thing a little before this speech. However, I also struggle to remember for sure, partly due to my lack of sobriety since we started living in the worst timeline.'
'> Dude told lady to "be quiet". How fucked up, disrespectful and condescending is that?\n\nThat isn\'t what you should be focusing on.'
'This seems very likely.  They’ve got dirt on him and he’s complying with their demands, making the entire country look stupid in the process. '
'Don’t forget about the entire Clinton/Obama email shit. Somehow all of that has also been swept under the rug.

"Not OP but:\n\n1. Completely baseless.\n\n2. If you're referring to the the DNC's bias against Bernie, then yeah it pisses me off. I voted Bernie in the primaries. But I'm not surprised the DNC did what it did. Bernie isn't a 'real' Dem. I still voted for Hillary, and I'm hoping the backlash will help the future DNC bring more of Bernie's ideals into the platform.\n\nBUT... The emails were stolen by the military of a foreign country. Not just any foreign country, but the country we are currently fighting a proxy war with in Syria. The country that isn't hesitating to expand its borders into it's neighbors with military power. The country that benefits most from a divided west. \n\nRussia is the single biggest military threat to the US, and they fucked with the very fabric of our democracy, our elections. "

"No no no. Don't try to move the goal posts. The FBI is being attacked, plain and simple. "
'Lol it’s a meme fuck that bitch'
"So, you don't have much confidence in the leadership of the FBI after all. I don't blame you since we already KNOW Comey leaked classified info to the NY Times and we already KNOW McCabe campaigned on behalf of his wife using FBI resources. Both of those FACTS are illegal, so I don't blame you for avoiding the bet. That's just the tip of the iceberg I'm sure. \n\nEdit: \nhttp://theweek.com/speedreads/710941/more-than-half-james-comeys-private-memos-contained-classified-information\n\nAnd I'll let the DEBUNKERS make the case for me for the second claim\n\n http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/25/donald-trump/tweet-donald-trump-revives-charge-improper-ties-be/\n\nBy adding this context\n\nhttps://www.circa.com/story/2017/06/27/the-face-of-fbi-politics-bureau-boss-mccabe-under-hatch-act-investigation"
"Your first link has this at the bottom:\n\n>Update, July 11: Comey's friend who helped leak elements of the memos takes issue with the suggestion that classified information was leaked, arguing, among other things, that several memos were retroactively marked classified. Bonnie Kristian\n\nSo that calls into question whether he leaked documents that were classified at the time.\n\nThe second link is saying that Trump's statement is wrong, so I don't think you even read that one.\n\nAs for the third one:\n\n>The FBI has said previously McCabe consulted ethics experts to ensure he didn't do anything improper with his wife's campaign and that the agent didn't believe he had ever campaigned or helped his wife's election. That claim, however, is now being challenged by the former FBI agent's complaint.\n\nIn this case, the blame lies on that expert, not on McCabe, he followed the proper channels. To accuse the FBI of lying is a big deal, and we have only this one guy's word to go against the agency. Either the FBI is conspiring against trump illegally, or one person is trying to cast doubt on the agency's legitimacy, the second one is far more likely, and he's completely innocent until proven guilty.\n\nIf the FBI was wrong when they said he wasn't breaking any rules, then as long as he asked, he didn't do anything wrong. This is all coming down to a lack of solid evidence from the accusers, so the argument is weak.\n"
"You've still failed to provide any concrete proof or evidence. Your sources disagreed with you and you're drawing conclusions from them that the writers never said. \n\nStop thinking you exist in some higher state of conciousness and everybody else is just too stupid to see what is going on. You're not. The Republicans and Trump are the easiest liars to spot, and you're buying everything they say. The Democrats lie too, but at least they try to hide it.\n\nWhen so many people are lying, trust only cold, hard facts. You've failed to present me with any, so your argument is null."
'The nature of a leak is that we know about it. If someone leaks something that nobody sees, is it still a leak? No. '
"Sticks and stones dude. I'm plenty informed and sadly I read bullshit from all sides of the spectrum. I'm hardly a conservative."
'The parallels are so obvious. They both stole the election!! Trump is NOT my president. I wish Mueller would take a tip from the watergate investigation though. They released the evidence early on and public pressure forced Nixon out. I hope Mueller gives us the evidence soon. We know he’s guilty. I just want to prove it to all the doubters. '
'Nixon was a horrific racist scumbag traitor who should have received the just punishment for treason. '
"The problem with this comparison is that Trump has Fox News a 24/7 propaganda Network. We really need to shut Fox News down and I'm not really sure how we go about doing that in a way that doesn't result in violence."

'Republicans have been at war with Democracy, committing voter suppression, lying, cheating, spreading disinformation, and committing treason for decades.. they truly are the greatest threat to the survival of this great nation and must be decisively defeated and retired to the dustbin of history.'
'Once of the scary things to me is that Trump has shown just how fragile everything is. We go Mussolini. An incompetent populrist salesman. Imagine if we got hitler or Putin. If Trump was even a little compedent things would be so much worse. Trump would be using the US military to invade mexico, Canada, Iran amd North Korea right now. They would make the Iraq invasion look like a small battle.  Any group that opposed Trump would be in jail.'
'I feel like even if the evidence was released the doubters would be screaming it was Fake News.'
'I dunno. I\'ve heard that it was better for everyone that it was not done. It would have caused more damage. \n\nObviously, it is not the same today. It is far worse. And I could be wrong about Nixon too. \n\nEdit: The guy I heard it from was President Ford. He felt the pardon was in the best interests of the country, and that the Nixon family\'s situation was "a tragedy in which we all have played a part. It could go on and on and on, or someone must write the end to it. I have concluded that only I can do that, and if I can, I must."\n\nTrump is different. If he can\'t be stopped by congress or law, you basically have a dictatorship. Nixon resigned, effectively ending the need for further prosecution. '
'Nixon did a few good things, but no way in hell was he a good President.'
'The war on drugs makes him a horrible president '
"All bad presidents do good things and all good presidents do bad things. That being said, I believe Nixon to be the former, not the latter. He was a racist piece of shit and I myself view it as unfortunate that Ford never let us see Nixon behind bars, even for a day.\n\nBut that's must my 2 cents"

'Trump hates America. Go back to the Donald where you can continue your “reee” nazi circle jerk. You guys live in a bubble.'
'That\'s the worst part of all this... it won\'t matter when the evidence is released, the Trumpers will deny that it\'s real.  They will point to a "deep state" conspiracy.  '
'No way. Mueller is the man. We may not have the evidence yet but it’s obvious Trump committed some crimes, and Muellers gonna drop a mountain of evidence on your ass!  In the words of your fascist dictator, believe me!'
'Does "everyone" include 250,000 dead Cambodians?'
"Actually Nixon had a colorful acquaintance with the [US Mafia](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/8x5jez/how-the-mafia-fueled-richard-nixons-political-career) having several people close to him, that were close to the Mob. It was said that J Edgar Hoover kept its hands of Nixon because the Mob had compromising information between an alleged homoerotic relationship between Hoover and Clyde Tolson, his second in command. This supposedly gave Nixon the green lights to do what he wanted (dirty tricks, Watergate). It was also why Hoover was so dead set against the Kennedy's who knew too much about the Mob influence as their Father Joe Kennedy, made his millions with associations with the mob and running liquor during prohibition. The Kennedy's wanted to go after the Mob, and Hoover did not. Incidentally Roy Cohn, one of Donald Trump and his father's attorneys and supposedly mentor to Donald trump supposedly was gay and had a relationship with J Edgar Hoover. Cohn later dies of an aids related disease.\n\nEither way, Hoover and Nixon shared a blighted past, and among Republicans Nixon was a known quantity, not a good one, most Conservatives disliked him, but his skeletons in the closet  with the mob were frequently taken out and waved around. Nixon though, unlike Trump had the head of the FBI in his pocket. Unfortunately for Nixon and fortunately for the US, J edgar Hoover died prior to Watergate breaking."
'What Stephen said is accurate, my parents voted for Nixon, and I forgive them for this, they didn’t know he didn’t have a “secret plan” ... they didn’t know he’d order the most infamous burglary! ... we have known for years that Donald Trump is a liar and a thief ... we cannot forgive his supporters!'
'Ah the murder porn author. I really give a flying fuck what he says'
"Read my last post if you want to know what I think about Trump and the GOP. I'm 60 and white and have no young children so I personally will be able to face anything as it comes. I feel the same way Comey does about the direction of the US that ultimately the people will steer the moral compass. Apathy may be a problem in the direction we take and I really can't understand any minority that wouldn't get out and vote because the vote can save minorities from oppression. And that seems to be the way it's heading with the GOP who wants isolation and white nationalism."
"Nixon was highly intelligent and highly competent. Generally speaking, he also had the best interests of the country at heart. He was also suspicious, paranoid, racist and anti-semitic - qualities which he took pains to hide (unlike Trump).\n\nWhat he was not was Governor of California, which he lost to Pat Brown (Jerry's dad) in 1962. He was a Congressman (on HUAC) who helped to nail Alger Hiss, a Senator (defeating Helen Gahagan Douglas - pink right down to her underwear) and Vice-President to one of the most popular Presidents in history. His narrow defeat by Kennedy in 1960 didn't help his generally suspicious and paranoid tendencies, leading to the dirty tricks campaign of 1972."
"He hasn't ended the Korean war, the stock market is inflated, the tax cuts are a giveaway to wealthy & big business & the rest of that is just right wing spin. Meanwhile US standing in the world is low, key government positions are unfilled, the State Dept is in shambles, the EPA is actively attacking the environment instead of protecting it, social programs are underfunded, and Dump is continually smearing the Intelligence services, the FBI, and the Justice Dept in a pathetic attempt to divert attention from his own stupidity & mistakes."
'Fixed the tax code? ... how do you know that? ... have you seen the deficit total for 2018? ... Do you really believe the solution for our deficit is Tax Cuts? ...

'It\'ll take at least that long to undo the damage Fox keeps inflicting on its viewership with the steady stream of leaks that point to increasingly unnerving truths.

"Your logic is incredibly stupid. Jesus the mental gymnastics that come from you poor Trumpers is amazing. The entire government is against trump, they're all in on it because they want to overturn the election. It's not because the man is an existential danger to the country, unfit mentally and emotionally. It's not like people are after him because hes trying to destroy agencies that are in place to protect the american people. It's not because he's an admitted sexual predator and rape apologist. It's not be like he has no ideas of his own, doesn't lead and will go along with whatever the last person that spoke to him said. No it can't be any of that or the other reasons *that are clear, public, problems* that anyone who pays attention to the situation can see oh no. It's allllll political. They just can't let the election be and they want to change it. \n\n\nGive me a fucking break dude. Whether there was collusion or not Trump is a disaster and an embarrassment unfit in every possible way. He lies as often as he breathes. \n\nHe needs to go. "
"Oh so saying you did the illegal thing is what's really illegal and not the actual illegal act?"
"Correct, common thinking is he wants to delay to see if the Dems take the house. \nMans been through so many admins, literally wrote the book on Iran-Contra, absolutely doesn't want to hand the info to this group of assholes bought and paid for. \n\nPreemptive edit: I'm sure there's dems with Russian  financial connections  that bled into election funding/Kompromat and I hope they get caught just the same. \nYou gonna hack; use American, Dutch, British, Aussie, Canadian, or French. We kinda have this historical thing that overrides everyone. "

"Doesn't it worry you that a powerful elite have been controlling both sides of the government. The FBI is not on your side, the government is not on your side. It's there to feed itself. President Trump was never supposed to win, why do you think every polling place had him at a 2% to near no chance of winning? It's because the DNC, the media and the polling places believe so firmly that they had it in the bag. The very fact Hillary didn't even bother to travel to some states proves they just thought they would follow the line and vote Democrat. You are just cattle for them, African Americans and Hispanic, illegal or legal are just votes in the bag they do nothing for. \n\nIt must feel bad being lied to so much, getting your hopes dashed. The FBI had  President Trump under surveillance before the end of the election (multiple FISA warrants on file) and he STILL BECAME PRESIDENT with NO VOTER ALTERATIONS. Again THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF RUSSIANS COMPROMISING ANY CITIZENS VOTE changing it from DNC to GOP, NONE"
"It's more than looking bad, giving full clearances to people who are currently under investigation or have obvious ties to Russians would only add to Trump's own criminal charges."
"> Can THIS be an impeachable offense? PLEEEEEASE?\n\nThe impeachability of the offense is meaningless if Congressional Republicans won't move to impeach.\n\nHe's arguably been impeachable since day one, for violating the emoluments clause, and the fucking GOP do nothing."

'Might make trump not look bad? What has made him look good? He’s done way more to make his presidency look bad than any democrat has done.  \n\nHe fired a Republican FBI director, who was then replaced with a Republican special council by a Republican deputy AG appointed by trump after the Republican AG appointed by trump recused himself because of his involvement.  \n\nThis is horrible partisan politics.  All on the side of the Republicans.  \n\nBut Obama started this unneeded investigation on the Trump campaign.  Oh you mean Carter Page who has been on the FBI’s radar since 2013.  Or Papadopolous, who plead guilty to lying to the FBI, that got on the FBI radar because he was drunk and bragging about meeting Russians.  '

And Flump who it “hates” and does not want to be president. \n\nBoth are under secret FBI investigation. But days before the election they only announce she is under investigation, guaranteeing she will lose. They don’t say anything about Flump being a corrupt shit bag also under investigation. \n\nThis action guarantees Smillary’s loss and Flump’s win, the candidate they “hate” and are trying everything to stop, will win. \n\nThat is some stupid assbackwards conspiracy. \n\n\n'

"The only point of the memo was to show how the fisa court was being used for political purposes. You completely avoided what I was saying. Why are you guys saying this is nothing when it shows proof that our government agencies were being used to illegally spy on American citizens for political purposes, that is definitely something no matter what your politics are. And why do you feel the need to say go fuck yourself? I'm just trying to understand how you guys think this isn't a issue. "
"Show me the actual FISA document and I might give a shit. \n\nUntil then, I don't care because Nunes is a lying piece of shit. His conclusions are likely incorrect. The factual information he provided was selectively edited for maximum damage on the Democrats. \n\nAll the memo is, is the opinion of someone who was supposed to have recused himself from the Russia investigation. Clearly, he's not doing that. So he, and you, can go fuck yourselves."
'You don’t have all the facts. No one does because the committee deliberately kept them from us choosing to try and capture the narrative for a week to cast enough doubt achieve several things, float a trial balloon about - firing Rosenstein, pivot trump away from testifying because he will be his own worst enemy. The only way This works is if gullible partisans buy it and push it as true. \n\nIf you give a damn about the things you say, truth, illegality etc. Demand Trump release the D memo. What are they afraid of? While we’re on the subject demand he release his tax returns like he promised, like every other candidate has before.\n\nDon’t we, yourself included have a right to know how Trump pay for all his hair products?\n\n'

'Courtesy of u/fox-mcleod\n\nHere\'s some of the ways this would directly be a crime for Donald Trump - collected, demonstrated,  and explained with original sources only:\n\n1.\t\u2060Under 18 USC 1001 - Trump made a materially false document in order to cover up a matter of investigation in the Trump Tower response memo which his lawyers accidentally revealed to the NYS was dictated by Trump.\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully— (1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact; (2) makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or (3) makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry;\n\n2. It also makes him an accessory to the Trump Tower meeting crime directly admitted to by Don Jr. and Kushner both of whom tweeted their own emails from the campaign. These emails were corroborated by Don Trump Jr. in a separate tweet. Both men have stated publicly that these tweets were real and from them. — In these tweeted images, Jr. states his intention and frame of mind plainly in the first image as, "The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was political opposition research... I decided to take the meeting" We now know that Kushner and Don Jr. believed the meeting to be about a thing of value, political opposition research. And made an attempt to meet.\n\nWhich violates 52 USC 30121\n\n(a) Prohibition It shall be unlawful for— (2) a person to solicit, accept, or receive a contribution or donation described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) from a foreign national\n\nIn other words...a crime was 100% committed by President Trump if this is all true.'
'**Cohen claims Trump knew in advance of 2016 Trump Tower meeting**\n\nCohen\'s claim would contradict repeated denials by Trump, Donald Trump Jr., their lawyers and other administration officials who have said that the President knew nothing about the Trump Tower meeting until he was approached about it by The New York Times in July 2017.\n\nCohen alleges that he was present, along with several others, when Trump was informed of the Russians\' offer by Trump Jr. By Cohen\'s account, Trump approved going ahead with the meeting with the Russians, according to sources.\n\nTo be clear, these sources said Cohen does not have evidence, such as audio recordings, to corroborate his claim, but he is willing to attest to his account.\n\nCohen privately testified last year to two Congressional committees investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. A source familiar with Cohen\'s House testimony said he did not testify that Trump had advance knowledge. Cohen\'s claims weren\'t mentioned in separate reports issued by Republicans and Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nContacted by CNN, one of Cohen\'s attorneys, Lanny Davis, declined to comment.\n\nRudy Giuliani, the President\'s attorney, said of Cohen, "He\'s certainly a source that is not credible."\n\n"Donald Trump Jr. has been professional and responsible throughout the Mueller and Congressional investigations," said Alan Futerfas, an attorney for Donald Trump Jr. "We are very confident of the accuracy and reliability of the information that has been provided by Mr. Trump, Jr., and on his behalf."\n\nAccording to people who have discussed the matter with Cohen, he has expressed hope that this claim about the Trump Tower meeting will help him reach out to Mueller and possibly lessen his legal troubles. He\'s under scrutiny by federal prosecutors in Manhattan after Mueller referred Cohen\'s case to them.\n\nThe June 2016 meeting was arranged after a publicist who knew Trump Jr. told him in emails -- in no uncertain terms -- that a senior Russian official "offered to provide the Trump campaign" with damaging information about Clinton, and that the outreach was "part of Russia and its government\'s support for Mr. Trump." At the time, the Russian operation to covertly boost Trump\'s candidacy wasn\'t publicly known. Trump. Jr. responded, "if it\'s what you say, I love it," and started to arrange the meeting.\n\nAt the meeting, Trump Jr. was joined by his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, who was Trump\'s campaign chairman at the time. There were four Russians in the room, including a lawyer with Kremlin ties, a businessman who worked for an oligarch and a lobbyist with old KGB connections.\n\nAfter news of the meeting broke in July 2017, the Trump team offered misleading explanations and changed their story several times. But one claim stayed consistent: that Trump had no knowledge of the meeting beforehand, wasn\'t told about it afterward and first learned about it one year later.\n\nThose denials were repeatedly issued by Trump, his attorney Jay Sekulow, Trump Jr., Futerfas and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. Those people denied that Trump had contemporaneous knowledge of the meeting on more than 15 occasions, according to CNN\'s analysis.\n\nTrump said on July 12, 2017, that he "only heard about it two or three days ago." One week later, Trump repeated that he "didn\'t know anything about the meeting" because "nobody told me" about it.\n\nAround that same time, CNN\'s Jake Tapper asked Sekulow to confirm Trump\'s claims that he only recently learned about the controversial meeting. Sekulow\'s response: "Yes, I swear."\n\nBut perhaps the highest-stakes denial was given by Trump Jr. in his testimony last year to the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n"He wasn\'t aware of it," Trump Jr. told lawmakers, referring to his father\'s knowledge of the meeting. "And, frankly, by the time anyone was aware of it, which was summer of this year, as I stated earlier, I wouldn\'t have wanted to get him involved in it because it had nothing to do with him."\n\nTrump\'s critics have long doubted these denials. They point to a series of phone calls Trump Jr. made to a blocked phone number before and after the meeting. They also note that two days before the meeting, Trump mysteriously announced plans to give a "major speech" about Clinton\'s scandals. Trump Jr. says he didn\'t get any dirt at the meeting -- and the speech never happened.\n\nEven Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist and top Trump campaign official, said the meeting was "treasonous" and speculated that "the chance that Don Jr. did not walk these (Russians) up to his father\'s office on the twenty-sixth floor is zero." Trump Jr. has denied Bannon\'s allegation. Bannon\'s comments, to author Michael Wolff for his book "Fire and Fury," triggered the bitter public divorce between Bannon and Trump in early 2018.\n\nAxios reported that Bannon does not have first-hand knowledge about whether Trump Jr. told his father, and Bannon later said his "treasonous" remark was directed at Manafort and not Trump Jr.\n\n✌ cool people read before commenting ✌'
'Read "Under the Bus: How My Attorney Fucked Me Out of the Presidency" by Donald Trump (with Janice Kirk)'
'It’s crazy making that we all knew this was true but wring our hands with pinning it down. Knowing the conniving nature and whole cloth dishonesty of Trump no objective person could say Trump was out of the loop. It is the tattered vestiges of the Office of President that has always given Trump shade. ‘If the President said he didn’t know about the meeting....’ then it seems the circumstantial reality is too speculative because he holds the Office. No more shade. Assuming Cohen gives this evidence his is the period at the end of the sentence already made: Trump knew of, colluded to approve the meeting , had its outcome reported to him and in national coverage asked Russia to go full steam ahead in its interference. \n\nThe reality is that Trump is and has always been a liar, but  his higher presumed standard to prove same is now solidly forming.'
'Considering that this was leaked by trumps team, I wonder if they said it just to see what would happen. Because, if it’s not true, Cohen or his attorney would have to say otherwise and deny something, making them look weak. '
'Shit I’ll take just trump jr going to jail for perjury.   That being said, Trump is fucked with the other crimes he committed. '
"I recall one article about Trump from before the election that said he was notoriously controlling, that even if one of his kids had negotiated a deal and come to an agreement, they still had to run it by him. If he didn't like the deal, which he usually didn't, they'd have to march all the way back downstairs in humiliation and dicker for whatever Trump wanted. It didn't matter which child it was.\n\nThere's no way a man like that would allow his son to negotiate with the Russians without final approval."
'You can have a video of Putin balls deep into Trump while Trump is killing a hooker and the current Congress will do nothing. They are not Americans '
'The blocked number is a smoking gun on this barrel of bullshit the Trump family has been  serving the public for months now'
'Pulls off a mask to reveal he’s Bernie Sanders. \n\n\nThe real Trump died in a Russian prison in 1995.\n\n\nNo wonder that debate never happened! \n\n\nBernie high fives a Navy Seal and all order is restored. '
"Fucks over his doctors, fucks over his lawyers, cheats his contractors, destroys the credibility of everyone that he forces to lie for him, there's a constantly revolving door of corruption scandals for those he hires, throws his allies under the bus constantly...\n\nI'm amazed anyone will work for or with this guy."
'That was my first thought.  This seems very very illegal by both parties.'
"To be fair, virtually everyone uses the word collusion incorrectly with regards to Trump. Even if he's guilty of working with the Russians, you won't see any charges of collusion because collusion is a term that only applies to antitrust cases. \n\nIn Trump's case, the charges are likely to be violations of campaign finance laws, possibly money laundering, and possibly criminal conspiracy. But not collusion. \n\nI get that there's not a chance in hell everyone will stop using the term now, just pointing out that it was mistaken to use it in the first place."
'Kinda related but isn’t it also a massive HIPAA violation to disclose he was using Propecia? The doctor sounds shady as fuck and I’m shocked he still has his license'
'I remember everyone here calling it total bullshit and obviously fake and the mindless Trump drones would just bleet and bleet and bleet denials.\n\n\nThis man proves how stupid they are on a near daily basis. A daily. fucking. basis.'
'Why sarcasm? He probably literally doesn’t understand what collusion means. He’s a fucking idiot. '
'>Collusion - secret or illegal cooperation or conspiracy, especially in order to cheat or deceive others.\n\nCollusion may not be the right work for the criminal charge but it is definitely the right word for what everyone is accusing him of. The charge will probably be criminal conspiracy among other things, but that word is muddy in the public eye. Many conspiracy theorists are on his side if /r/conspiracy is any judge.'
"I think it's really dangerous to think of him as an idiot.  He knows what he's doing and that's even worse."
"You're right, my bad. You've been desperate for about 16 months now. This just shows the depths of that desperation."
"This, We should all suggest he's too scared to go back on Fox after they cut him off. Get a trending hashtag on twitter going for him. He cant resist the bait. \n\n"
'The thing that confuses me about this whole ordeal is that one irrational person is acceptable. But the entire trump regime is just the biggest clusterfuck of corruption,  poor decision making and a complete inability to comprehend their consequences. I don’t understand how such a massive group of people lack basic foresight or self awareness. How stupid do you have to be? '
'So it mentions separate charges in DC and Virginia, but refers to both of them as federal charges. If there are no state charges, Trump could just pardon him, right?'
'Yeah, but if he flips he faces sudden death by a Russian nerve agent.'
"Probably closer to 30 or 40 if you go by guidelines vs max sentence, but we're still talking about dying in prison "
'Cryo his dead corpse to make sure he serves his time!!'
'Damn. He fucked up. '
'"Could face the rest of his life, and almost 300 years or more..."\n\nThey just sentenced him to death in five years, lol.'
'get fucked you james bond villain clownstick'
'Seriously. The notion that "Oh, it was just some people in the campaign and Trump had no real involvement" is such a huge f- cop-out. So sick of hearing that. Even if that\'s true (which I don\'t think it is), that means he was elected under the pretext that he was colluding with a hostile foreign power. Some of those campaign folks made it into his cabinet or administration, some of which are still there. And even beyond all of that -- if he can\'t run a campaign without collusion -- why the hell should he be trusted to run the country?'
"I think the level of incompetence and cronyism is one of the factors that increases the likelihood that someone near the top of his administration will dish the dirt on The Donald.  \n\nWhile I'm here... I don't think I've ever really bothered to notice or mention just how obnoxious it is that Trump was referred to as the Donald.  And, did he even refer to himself as The Donald?  Don't recall exactly but it seems likely.  "
"i mean, it's life in prison, that's just about the worst sentence you can get besides the death penalty.\n\nseems about right to me"
'IANAL, but I think the reason it’s stated this way is because each crime he’s being charge for has a numerical sentence, not “life.” I honestly don’t know what all crimes carry a “life” sentence, but I’m thinking things like murder. If he had committed a crime with a life sentence they might start calling it what it is. Butfrom a legal perspective, if he’s committed 30 crimes with a 10 year sentence they have to say 300 years. '
'I feel like other people kind of said it but not exactly. The idea is if you have three separate crimes, say 3 counts of murder at 100 years a piece, then you have a 300 year sentence. If later the case is appealed, or new evidence comes to light, or whatever and the the ruling is overturned for one of the murder and the sentence is dropped then you still have two other sentences and are in jail for 200 years still.\n\nMeanwhile if they treated them all as one sentence, and something happened to get the ruling overturned or a mistrial or whatever then the entire thing goes out the window and the defendant walks free. So it’s mainly a matter of redundancy to hope that no matter what something will keep them in jail.'
"That's why state charges will be filed if he does... why do people still push this narrative. Mueller is working closely with multiple State AG's, Manafort is going to die in prison :)"
'I don’t think anyone could possibly erode the office more than Donald Trump had done. The only way he could do worse was if he took a shit in the press room.'
'As somebody else mentioned at some point -- will he really be forced to spill the beans if he is pardoned?  What exactly is stopping him from just keeping his mouth shut and saying nothing?  What are they going to do?  Give him another 50 years onto his sentence?'
"I'd say life in prison is worse than death. Death is final, the end. Nothing after. Life in prison is suffering."
"Let's run through it. Please tell me if I've missed any steps:\n\n1) There is no evidence of contact with Russians\n\n2) If there is evidence, the President didn't know about it\n\n3) if the president did know, it wasn't improper contact\n\n4) If it was improper, it wasn't collusion or coordination\n\n5) If it was collusion, then collusion is not a crime.\n\n6) And if collusion is a crime, then you can't indict a sitting president.\n\nWhat did I miss?"
'"You see, Trump *had* to collude with the Russians. It was actually high patriotism, because Trump knew Hillary would destroy America -- and he did whatever was necessary to stop her."\n\nFox News shortly'
'"Collusion? what collusion, i don\'t see any collusion, YOU\'RE Collusion, you\'re also fake news, now i\'m going to have you arrested for leaking stuff, even though what you leaked was FAKE NEWS."'
"I'm sort of worried for the future. I'm worried that too many people, by the time the midterms or even 2020 roll around, will just assume that everyone else is gonna be so fired up all over the country that they will SURELY turn out to the poll booth to vote these fuckers out... And then they'll just stay ~home~ at work (forgot yall have elections on a Tuesday) ... And nothing will change. I'm not American but my wife is, and I can see the shock and disbeleif turning into fatigue day by day. It's like this has been part of the plan: to drag this all out for so long that by the time the critical moment comes around everyone is just over it.\n\n"
'Lol, it’s all coming out. Brennan is losing it. These rats are going to start flipping and Mueller will go down with the treasonous ship. Get your popcorn.'
'There is no crime titled "collusion".\n\nThe crimes are,  intent to defraud the United States of America, conspiracy to defraud the United States of America, conspiracy to commit a computer crime (hacking)... Likely perjury for Trump, due to his ability to lie constantly. \n'
"> 5) If it was collusion, then collusion is not a crime.\n\nI love this one. Colluding with a foreign power to gain an advantage during an election is a crime, but there is no actual crime named 'collusion'. \n\nThe statement has two different meanings depending on how informed the other person is so essentially you can use it as a truth to an informed person or use it as a lie to an uniformed person. Pure genius.\n"
'0) There was no collusion.  \n\nFirst of all they denied it full stop. THEN they said \'well, there\'s no /evidence/ of it".'
"I think people who are fired up will turn out to vote, even if they're fatigued from the bullshit. This isn't 2016 where some left-leaning voters didn't turn out because 1) they didn't think Trump could possibly win and 2) they disliked Hillary. The threat of Trump is constant and real. I don't think it'll be so easy for Russia to run the same misinformation campaign on the various people running in 2018, and I would hope the Democratic Party is prepared for attacks on their candidate in 2020.\n"
"Your dumb ass doesn't know there is no such charge as collusion. Get a better news source."
'You do know Hilary’s not president, right? Do her actions make collusion with a hostile foreign power by a sitting president any less treasonous? And if she did do something illegal, lock her ass up, too. Why do you think this is an either/or issue???'
'If so then sure arrest her ass, doesn’t make what trump and company has done any less illegal'
"Hillary Clinton bring shitty doesn't make Trump great. That's not the way things work. "
'> There is no crime titled "collusion".\n> \n> The crimes are,  intent to defraud the United States of America, conspiracy to defraud the United States of America, conspiracy to commit a computer crime (hacking)...

"How fucked up is it that he named his son after an alter ego he used back in the '80's\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonyms_of_Donald_Trump"

The uranium deposits are of relatively poor grade and are too costly to compete on the uranium market.

Theoretically, they could process 20% of our ore, but that will never happen.

"Yep. But the key here isn't just that it's a crime, it's a *federal* crime. And since Sean apparently spends each night curled up in bed on the phone with the one person who can absolutely pardon an individual from any and all consequences related to committing a federal crime, I can see why he'd be so willing to do this on public television. \n\nI mean, why not?

In fact, I suspect most/all of them they are—to some extent—guilty as sin. That being said....\n\n*All* facts considered, trusting the FBI to investigate Trump—or corruption in general—makes about as much sense as trusting *Trump* to investigate Trump.

'Thanks for actually engaging me in conversation! Most people just insult me, and make no effort to actually converse.\n\nTo be honest, I think you’ve lost sight of the fine line that separates pessimism from realism in the world of politics. The problem isn’t that “politicians on both sides can lack testicles”. That’s a severely naïve assessment if you ask me. \n\nThe problem—in a nutshell—is that our entire political system has been entirely corrupted by the wealthy and well-connected—people who either rose to power by selling their souls in order to excel at cutthroat capitalism, or who inherited their power and feel like dominion over commoners is their birthright. \n\nOn top of that, the problem is that popular opinion is now *literally* dictated by those same people via mainstream media, which has come to be controlled *exclusively* by that particular class of person via finance. Both the mainstream liberal media and the mainstream conservative media (the only news media Americans take seriously) are entirely subservient to the people who can afford to finance them. Because of this, investigative journalism has effectively gone extinct, only to be replaced by brainwashy, subversive, and intellectually dishonest sensationalism. After all, investigative journalists live to expose corruption and abuses of power, which is extremely bad for business if you’re one of the corrupt, power-hungry financiers behind every for-profit news conglomerate from FOX to CNN. The free press is supposed to be a weapon the people can wield against would-be tyrants. Now, thanks to the corrupting power of money, it’s a weapon that the wealthy and well-connected wield against the people with devastating efficiency and cunning. These days, virtually every incriminating truth and innovative idea that could stand to shift the balance of power towards the people and away from the wealthy is drowned out by an endless stream of sensationalist propaganda. Rogue dissidents who somehow manage to make themselves heard invariably have their credibility baselessly eviscerated by a legion of corporate reporters. News flash: if dozens of corporate reporters publicly denounce an individual as a liar, even if that individual is the only person who’s actually standing by the truth, people will believe it, no matter what. Obviously, such cases are the exception, not the rule, but the fact that people can— and *do*—get away with this sort of scheme is a *huge* red flag. The way our government and media treat whistleblowers is proof enough of this concept. Gary Webb is a shining example of how this happens. If you don’t know about him, the movie Kill The Messenger does an excellent job of telling his story. Really, you can read up on *any* modern American whistleblower to verify the validity of this claim.\n\nI’m not going to bother touching on how mass media can easily be used to manipulate public elections. After all, every American liberal is up in arms over Trump/Russia because of this, although I can’t even begin to fathom why liberals can’t bring themselves to recognize that *American* propaganda has the exact same effect on our political process as Russian propaganda, albeit to a much, *much* greater magnitude. \n\nOn top of all *that*, the problem is that the American people at large have no interest whatsoever in suspending their blissfully naïve, narrow-scoped, mass-media-driven “worldviews” long enough to let reality set in, because they’re too stubborn, too afraid, and too arrogant to admit that they’ve let themselves be manipulated by homegrown corporate propagandists. Liberals overwhelmingly do this. Conservatives overwhelmingly do this. Both sides *regularly* call one another out for doing this. Yet, evidently, both sides would sooner let the world descend into chaos and violence than they would admit that they’ve been acting like moronic hypocrites this whole time. \n\nBy the way, the way Democrats have reacted to this Russian propaganda pseudo-scandal has effectively sent this message to the world: “It’s okay if *we* meddle in other nation’s governments, and bully them into submission with our military and economic might, but if any of you try doing it to us, we’ll come unhinged.” Not a great message for American liberals to send to the world when we’re trying to earn their respect, support, and cooperation. I’d encourage you to revisit the claims I made about the FBI in my original comment while keeping that thought in mind. The FBI—not to mention American law enforcement in general—has always been an anti-liberal organization, and this is *exactly* the kind of deceitful, manipulative tactic that people in power use to undermine public support for liberal causes. Seriously, read up on COINTELPRO and modern counterintelligence tactics, and prepare to have your mind blown.\n\nAll in all, American politics has gone from being a respectable profession of public service to being a cutthroat game played by aloof upper-echelon narcissists, and oblivious idiots who are too naïve to threaten the status quo. Similarly, American news media have gone from being principled bastions of truth to being omnipresent propaganda machines that work exclusively for the radically wealthy. Until Americans can come to terms with the fact the free press died on our watch, and that we let our government become corrupt while we were busy getting drunk, watching sports, and hanging out at the mall, the free press will stay dead, and nothing will ever change. \n\nNow, for the love of humanity, you folks *have* to stop blaming conservatives for running our nation—and the world—into the ground, because you’re just as guilty as they are. Just because you were smart enough to recognize that Donald Trump—the most obviously corrupt presidential candidate in American history—is a crook, and just because you’re not brainwashed enough to fear immigrants doesn’t mean you haven’t been blindly aligning yourselves with crooks each and every time you vote, and it doesn’t mean you haven’t been brainwashed too.\n\nThe sad irony here is that you believe *I’m* the pessimist, when you’re the one who’s clearly resigned himself to this insane game of divisive, anti-productive, cutthroat politics, and I’m the one who wholeheartedly believes that we can *definitely* fix all this shit if we just stop playing into this game by ruthlessly and hypocritically shaming each other for making mistakes that we’ve *all* been making, and start working together instead. \n\nAt any rate, after seeing all the arrogant, self-righteous, and hypocritical bullshit that Democrats have been spewing since the 2016 election, I can say for certain that I’m never voting democrat again. Obviously I won’t be voting republican either., but y’all lost my loyalty when you became completely unhinged after losing to Trump—*the most blatantly corrupt presidential candidate of all time*. The fact that we lost to him should have been a huge wake up call for Democrats. Instead, dems are using it as an excuse to ridicule and alienate people who are marginally less worldly-wise than they are—the people we need to team up with if we want to un-corrupt our government and media so they start working *for* the people, not against them.\n\nAnyways, thanks again for engaging me in conversation! I hope I was able to get you thinking!\n\nAll the best, cool guy!'

Using this excuse to make it even harder for certain people to get to the polls than it already is? \n\nOr the blatant fear mongering, constantly droning on about those scary “others” who want to take us down so bad. (Muslims, NK, Immigrants) Even though our own Military has said currently white supremacists are the biggest threat to national security. \n\nOr how about his general “I alone can fix it” attitude that has been so widely used amongst dictators and absolutists over the century’s. He mocks and bully’s all of his opponents, republican or otherwise. Not winning over them argumentatively, simply throwing schoolyard insults around.\n\nOr the fact that he’s wrapping himself in the flag as a political tool in order to shut down legitimate legal non disruptive protests, referring to protesters as “sons of bitches”. Ignoring and to an extent straight up lying about what the protesters are actually protesting. This has been a common tactic among authoritarian governments, when protestors are trying to spread a message, convolute and dissolute that message as much as possible so it looses traction and fizzles out. (Trying to twist the NFL protests that are actually about police violence against blacks, into disrespecting the flag, the anthem, and our troops) \n'
"Hinting at revoking the media licenses of outlets that criticize him, firing an FBI official that wouldn't swear fealty, twitter meltdowns any time checks and balances take effect and his rhetoric that sympathizes with white nationalist groups which have a history of authoritarian politics, see early 20th century Germany.  He's a crybaby who thought his station had way more power than it does and he's shocked that the other branches have as much say in policy as he does."

What substantial pieces of information has he generously bestowed upon us that the evil liberal media never reported? I’d like to hear them.\n\n2. Really?

And his solution is Betsy Devos???? LOL. I’d love to hear the steps trump has taken to address our failing infrastructure, inner city violence, and lack of job growth. It’s one thing to scream and shout about issues, it’s another thing to actually fix them. Also idk but maybe military personnel have a better idea than the average shmuck about who is a more credible and dangerous threat to the country? \n\n4. It’s not reaching. Look it up. Almost every dictator in the last 100 years has run his public image on this same line of thinking. “I alone can fix it”. It’s a form of absolutism and a strategy for building a cult of personality. Do I think trump is literally a dictator? Of course not. We have checks and balances to keep that from happening. Do I think he has an eerily similar personality to most dictators? You bet. Where was trumps outrage when a foreign dictator had his goons literally beat American citizens protesting on American soil? I’d bet you trump wished he could get away with the same shit.\n\n5. “Shut down” is a figure of speech. And regardless everything the president says carries political and social weight. There are people out there who go along with whatever this guy says no matter what. You’re foolish if you think him denouncing those protests wasn’t a political tool to stir up hate and anger from the right while diluting the actual point of the protest, in order to try and shut them down. \n\n'

'> In the context of the real world, with regard to this administration, 95% negative coverage requires a selective presentation of information, disingenuous spin, and outright fabrication to achieve.\n\nAccording to who? You’re not really arguing, you’re just insisting your point of view is correct. Your statement is predicated on the assumption that Trump doesn’t deserve the level of negative coverage he’s getting, and you might be right, but you haven’t given the reader any reason to think you are. Even if you bothered to source your numbers this would still be the case, because your reasoning here is fundamentally irrational. Negative coverage doesn’t constitute bias, and you labeling this view as asinine is no more an argument against it than anything else you’ve written.\n\nIf your best counterpoint is to simply stomp your feet and insist that you’re right, you haven’t left the reader much choice but to conclude you’re wrong. You’d be much better off citing specific examples of mainstream media outlets reporting on Trump in an indisputably biased way. '

'I don’t give a rats ass about his lifestyle. I just want his ability to do more crime disabled and want his testimony to disable more criminals'
'But there may very well be a reason for it. Look at what just happened yesterday. Manafort tries to argue that the trial needs to be postponed; he’s trying to stall.

'If you read the full quote, it is much more benign. \n\n>the professionals at Alexandria Detention Center are very familiar with housing high-profile defendants, including foreign and domestic terrorists, spies and traitors.\n\nIn reality, he just called Manafort a "high-profile defendant" which is absolutely true.'
"Yeah of course. No man should be prosecuted if they didn't commit the crime. However, it would be equally fucked up for him to get off if he did commit the crime because of a bias jury in his favor, which is exactly what his lawyers are trying to do. I know it's all part of the game, but ridiculous either way. With all the evidence they have, I don't see how he isn't guilty. I really hope if he is, they make an example out of him and prosecute to the fullest extent. "

'I have a theory that Trump supporters never went through the psychological/emotional developmental phase of questioning and rebelling against abusive authority figures. Whether in the form of an authoritative parent, fire-and-brimstone religious teachings, or a military chain of command, their subconscious still processes the world as a game of which stick-carrying authority figure to follow (and condemn others for not following).\n\nTrump taps into this neurosis and gives them a new emotionally unstable authority figure to follow. This is why he can do no wrong in their minds.'

'It’s both. They are using the same tactic and pointing the finger at each other. Trump knows how to use the media. And his tactics cant be more predictable. He starts every negotiation with a stick and eventually get’s to a carrot colored stick. He also placates his base, who he doesn’t care about. If he can get a bigot to vote for him, he feels it’s ok.. I mean he used the mob for his realastate business for Christ sake. But let’s not pretend like it doesn’t go both ways.  Like I said seeing things for what they are isn’t very popular now, so I expect some flack. But sadly I feel like using this platform to have reasoned discussion rather than chanting my side’s slogan. And my side got beat from both ends... maybe trump has done enough damage to give us a bernie, but I don’t think things got bad enough in 2008, or maybe we had our expectations lowered so much by obama we lost all hope and trump is what it looks like when that happens. \n\nAnyhow, my advice is let’s live and see. I am not seeing any party involved as having the average citizens interest in mind, and as long as we are fighting each other the money makers can continue to live off our misery.  Both parties are pro war, the enemy changes a bit, but the weapons are still sold. Economic disparity under Obama was bad too.. '

It came out later that potus was mad because they didn't make him pay for his flight back to Washington.   Potus is such a petty bully and it shows in this type of behavior that he shows. He's like the little guy who finds out he has not only tiny hands with Vienna sausage fingers but also has the smallest dick in the locker room."
'They *are* standing in they way of that, or at least McGahn is.

'I guess I really started worrying when Comey handed the letter to Chaffetz, and Chaffetz leaked it, shortly before the election. I just thought she had enough momentum that she could get through that, and I guess I thought it was so freaking obvious what an idiot and liar trump was that he would never make it. I learned, though. Never take our democracy, or how ~~dumb~~ gullible some other Americans may be, for granted.'

'> The phrase "high crimes" actually does not mean "serious crimes" but rather offenses committed by high officials. \n\nThat\'s sort of irrelevant to the point I was making though: they don\'t actually need any crimes at all.  \n\nWithin the context of what we\'re discussing, most of what you posted with the significant exception of incompetence *would* be considered high crimes.  The phrase in this context does not require statutory lawbreaking, but it *does* require malfeasance.  \n\nThe term isn\'t just made up - it is a term with meaning within the common law tradition, and does broadly refer to abuses of power by officials in that sense even if those abuses are not breaking a specific law.  The term emphatically does *not* refer to incompetence within that tradition.  \n\nBut what happens if they ignore all that?  They could impeach for bad fashion sense, for sneezing on thursday, or for no real reason at all.  \n\nThat\'s a major constitutional flaw.   Yes, you correctly point out that the situation where it would be relevant is unlikely.  But if we *did* get a supermajority in both houses that wanted to impeach the President for a triviality, and the President refuses to accept the conviction because it *obviously* does not involve real "high crimes and misdemeanors", what happens?  \n\nThere\'s a real potential there for a constitutional crisis if the stars aligned.

We can follow twitter for real time tweets, why don\'t the Press add value by committing to put the tweets and Trump\'s statements in context?

FAKE GUILT!" or something equally vapid.\n\nI give it 10 minutes before The_Dingleberries are instructed to claim that Gates has been gotten to by "muh *deep state*" and somehow forced to lie about being as guilty as a priest in an altar boy.'
"I worry sometimes that Manafort is as far as Mueller will get. I don't care if Manafort is nailed if Trump gets away. What if Manafort won't talk because he fears for his life bc of the Russian government?"
'And he will likely do no time. NONE. Not sure why no one is talking about this.  I read the plea agreement.\n\nMaximum penalty for the plea he took is 6 months in white collar minimum security "camp". They call them camps because they are very similar to summer camps. Most don\'t even have a fence - Some have tennis courts - Most have legit movie theaters also. Like an FCI Morgantown or somewhere very similar.\n\nThe way it works from the federal level is that they take your criminal history to lump you into one of 6 categories. He has no criminal history so he ended up in the 0 column. People who have lengthy criminal histories end up in the 4, 5, and 6 category. THEN they then assign you a number based on the severity of your crime. This number starts at 1 minimum and a maximum number of 40 \'ish. (or somewhere close to that) Gates is a grand total 4. Yes... FOUR\n\nThese two numbers act as multipliers to each other and determine your sentence and the security level of the prison you qualify for.\n\nSo Gates took a plea for category 0 (criminal history) and a 4 on the point scale (severity) - And when they take the two numbers to a chart they have made - It basically shits out a number which determines a minimum and a maximum sentence - Which the judge ultimately decides. \n\nThe minimum and maximum on the plea he took is anywhere from 0 months minimum to 6 months max. Most judges and prosecutors go for the lower end of the scale - Meaning the judge will likely enforce the lower number which is 0 months in prison. Even if the judge enacts the maximum - 6 months - Federal felons only do 85% of their time because of good time and other factors. They also have to do the final 10% of their sentence on house arrest or in a halfway house.\n\nMeaning that after its all said and done... the worst possible case scenario is that Gate does a whopping 4 months and 15 days in a really do-able minimum security camp (also determined by his criminal history - He will be in there with other guys with little to no criminal history.)\n\nBut remember.. the most likely scenario is 0 months in prison. Judges 90% of the time enact the minimum sentence for the guideline. Especially if you cooperated and signed a plea.'

"Manafort is facing the rest of his life, which is a few decades in prison or a couple months if he flips.\n\nEdit: To clarify, if he chooses to die in prison he will just bite his tongue and go to jail for the rest of his life. If he flips, he and his family will be targets for not just Putin's mafia government but many of the criminals he's aided.\n\nHere's the thing, Manafort has serious dirt on Republicans. That's his behind the scenes leverage here. How much pull that has, who knows?"
"Not a lawyer, but Manafort is clearly liable for 'die in prison' level jail time.  I wouldn't be surprised if he goes for a deal."

"See, what I never understood is his double standards.  The thing is, his motivations throughout was never fully materialized but just conferred based on how everything played out.  Even that's a bit weak on determining what his true motivations were.  Some could even argue that he motivated because of some gripe against his former boss.  Maybe he simply just wants to jump ship... We can't say for sure what's going in his mind.\n\nBut clearly if you payed attention from the very beginning, he was obviously disturbed by losing a friend in battle.  What I never understood was that a short while later he helped Poe basically murder more of his fellow Stormtroopers.  So he became a traitor because of that guy wiping some blood on his face then later on helps the Rebellion kill countless more?  Meh, I don't buy it."

'Oh yeah, I completely agree.\n\nBeing a Vet, he is basically a traitor in my eyes when he failed to respond adequately in condemning Russia for attacking US forces with conventional weapons and a nerve agent attack on our historic ally.  In fact, he kowtowed at every turn.  Just about short of sucking him off a few times actually\n\nI was the "lock Hillary up" type just a year ago for her disregard of classified information.  If I was willing to say that about her, it would be a gross double standard if I didn\'t call Trump anything less than a traitor after everything he\'s done.\n\nSo my opinion stands, he\'s a fucking traitor.  Besides, isn\'t it pretty fucking obvious?'
"All solid great points. I just don't want the opposition to have any quarter to say 'Look they're not interested in justice they just don't like the president'.  Whenever I get into it with the Trump crew it always comes around to how the only reason all this is an issue is because people want Trump out because they don't like him.  Like you brought up it is way more than that. "
'Because the low road is what got him elected. It took campaigns like "lock her up" and "build the wall because mexicans are dirty criminal rapist" that helped elect the man. The truth is there is no difference between a trumper and an anti trumper they\'re no different.  Shit posting proves this. \n\nTaking the low road allows you to be easier to manipulate in the future, it primes your understanding of the world into very vague black and white thinking that others can play like a fiddle using gutter politics. Should always guard yourself against sinking yourself to low effort low thought shit posting.  There are lots of places where you can see people actively guard against this stuff because how toxic it is.  There are lots of subs with people making real efforts to figure things out, discuss and inform others about a topic.   Than there are other places that sit around pointing and calling people cucks and nazis. \n\n\nTrump isn\'t the only person in the category of worst person to lead the country.

Babafemi traveled from Nigeria to Yemen in 2010-2011, where he met with AQAP leaders who trained him in the importance of the English-language media to AQAP and its mission to inspire lone wolf attacks abroad in the name of al-Qaeda.  Babafemi was extradited to the United States from Nigeria, pled guilty, and sentenced to 22 years of imprisonment.

"Why are sane people resorting to this whole mocking of this orange idiots dick size? C'mon, we're better than any other conservative who've got their heads up this clown's ass and have such pathetic retorts. Plus I'm pretty sure Trumturds are pleased that their God had fucked a porn star\nI just hope this pathetic human being gets impeached and/or jailed.

'About a year ago I cut my Trump-supporting friend out of my life. He is an ex-coworker now but back in the day I considered him to be my “work husband.”\n\nAnyway, he just emailed me yesterday asking if he is still in the dog house (I have ignored 3 similar outreaches). I’m trying to craft my reply now and have no idea which direction to go in.\n\nIf he admits he’s an idiot and Trump is a traitor to democracy, fine. If he still thinks Trump is the best thing ever, then no. At this point if you support Trump you’re either evil or an idiot, and I have no room for such people in my life. \n\nAny suggestions?'
'I obviously agree with basically all of this, but the only thing I’m struggling with, not just in context of what you’ve written here, but all over, is that last part.  About having compassion.\n\nI really don’t think I can anymore.  And that’s the scary part.  Lines have been irreparably crossed.\n\nI’m in much the same position as you, OP.  My dad has always been a hardcore republican and we used to be able to talk politics all the time. But within the span of **A YEAR AND A HALF**, literally from the time trump entered the race to the inauguration, I watched the transformation happen in real time.  Late 2015, we used to joke about trump and how stupid and racist everything he said and everything about him was.  We were both in mutual agreement that the idea of him being president was literally a “comic book nightmare”.  He was pro-Rubio.  He hated all this shallow reality TV idiocy.  Even listening to trump talk disgusted him, and he said so.\n\nThen a few months later, I started to get emails from him of pro-trump editorials.  When I broke down how wrong they were, he would reply that he knew, but he was “just trying to see if there’s more substance there”.  He sends me emails in support of Evan McMullin, claiming both candidates are equally unqualified.  Later, I send him things compiling every scandal and racist statement of trumps.  Literally, every one at the time of late 2016.  The only response I get back: “where is one for Hillary?”\n\nThen the “grab em by the pussy” tape drops.  My dad and I don’t talk.  I think “good, at least he’s definitely not supporting him now”.  The guy bragged about sexually assaulting women and has accusers in the double digits.  Who *could* support that, right?\n\nAbout three days after the election, after I’ve taken some time to cool down, he calls me.  It’s clear he voted for trump, and I knew it.  He asks how I feel and I say something to the effect “every woman and POC I know is terrified but hey let’s see how it goes”.  He immediately snaps and goes ballistic saying that’s completely untrue/minorities have NO basis for being terrified/Obama was the worst president of all time because he was divisive/we need UNITY/etc etc.  I lived in a small college town at the time, one that experienced many hate crimes the day after trump got elected.  Klan members marching one town over.  People spray-painting walls with “black lives don’t matter and neither do your votes”.  My fiancée’s Muslim friends getting their hijabs ripped off in public.  Our gay friends having people yell at them “where’s your Clinton now, faggot?”.  I detail all of this to him.  Silence.  Later, all I hear is “I’m a bit skeptical of the whole ‘terrified’ thing.  They can always move somewhere else”.\n\nTwo months later, I drove to DC for the women’s march, because my fiancée and I were volunteering to help the disability caucus there.  He called me up one day after to berate me for driving to Washington DC to go to the march.  Berated me for ranting on facebook against the Muslim ban.  Told me I should actually do something for the community instead of rant publicly.  When I told him we literally went for the sake of volunteering to help the disabled, he mocked me.  “OH IM SURE YOU DID SO MUCH FOR THE NICE LADIES AT THE MARCH”.  In the same call, he ACTUALLY DENIED that trump ever mocked a handicapped person.  Claimed it never happened.  He mocks everyone that way.  You don’t know the facts.  Trump is doing good.\n\nMy family has always been movie-obsessed and taken the oscars very seriously.  We make picks.  We compete.  We cook huge dinners and desserts.  It’s always been a fun yearly tradition we have.  In 2017, he refused to partake.  You see, the oscars were just going to be anti-trump.  His allegiance was there now, even in leisure, even among family.\n\nMy dad doesn’t know it, but Ive always been able to see his twitter account.  Once again, merely a year and a half prior, he was a principled republican with boundaries of decency.  Then, a year later, after EVERYTHING trump said and did, after bragging about sexual assault, after having 19 accusers, after calling his accusers ugly at a rally to cheers, after Mexican rapists, after Muslim bans, after klan endorsements and klan defenses at Charlottesville, after mountains of collusion evidence, after pedophile endorsements, after EVERYTHING, he is now just shy of the ugliest right-wing dogma you can hope to find.  He not only condoned all of it, but loved trump more and more with each step, and his twitter endorsements paint the picture.  White supremacy is on the rise because minorities demonize whites.  Pro-choicers want abortion rights because they’re happy to kill lives inside of them.  Gun violence is only higher than normal because of black on black crime.  The fact that Muslims aren’t doing more to fight radicalism is proof that they all silently approve of it.  Trans people are mentally ill.  Send the dreamers back home, who cares.  Obama and James Clapper are going to jail any day now.  Hillary killed Seth rich.  Look at our great president, shaking hands with police officers, a truly great man.  The FBI is corrupt to the core and sabotaging trump to cover for Hillary, who ACTUALLY colluded.  Liberals are mentally diseased and what’s wrong with America.\n\n\nWe live in the same town.  We now don’t talk unless we have to.  There is no reaching some of these people with compassion and reaching out.  They’re lost, their sense permanently eroded.  The beliefs are too uniformly evil for me to have any empathy, even when trying my best.  To me, that will forever be the worst part about this administration.'
'Duh.  A scorpion asks a frog to carry it across a river. The frog hesitates, afraid of being stung, but the scorpion argues that if it did so, they would both drown. Considering this, the frog agrees, but midway across the river the scorpion does indeed sting the frog, dooming them both. When the frog asks the scorpion why, the scorpion replies that it was in its nature to do so.'
'Been getting copy paste requests so here it is\n\n\nWhatever happened to the trade war with China he promised during his campaign? Oh, never mind, his company personally got a 500 MILLION dollar bribe recently. Check out the ZTE stuff. It\'s not a HOAX, the money is there and it\'s proven. So now, the countries he actively campaigned against are his biggest ally. Half a billion dollars go a long way though. Tariffs ARE GREAT FOR THE U.S, IF AND ONLY IF, WE HAVE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED SYSTEMS AND FACTORIES TO TAKE OVER ALL THE LOSS OF STEEL AND ALUMINUM PRODUCTS AT LOW COST. \n\nBIg heads up, we don\'t. PA used to have a huge steel industry but all their plants are old and rusted. A lot of small businesses will go out of business because of this. America makes MORE money trading with our allies, not less. This in the end will only hurt the American people. Harley Davidson already shut down a factory and will probably have to do more because of it. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/05/31/trump-has-officially-put-more-tariffs-on-u-s-allies-than-on-china/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.842047ac083d\n\nThis isn\'t a conspiracy theory. This isn\'t freaking a opinionated article. It\'s ALL OVER EVERYTHING. Even FOX news recently had a big backlash because they had interviews where FOX employees actively said that the "Spy-gate" claims were not based in reality and to let Mueller, who IS a republican and was APPOINTED by republicans, do his job.\n\nI\'ve researched this shit for a while now and people who don\'t care that they spread stuff that isn\'t true should be ashamed of themselves. I\'m sorry but I\'m getting tired. Tired of spending a while on learning stuff so I can talk about it and feel that I have a right to do so because I\'ve put time and energy into it. Too many people are SO PERSONAL about their politics but when I ask them about specifics, and votes on certain things, or elected officials they have no idea what or who they are talking about. How do you feel so strongly for something when you put no effort into it? It\'s mind boggling. \n\nWe have allies for a reason. I\'m sorry I rant on Facebook. I don\'t like seeing it either, but this fake news shit has gotten so out of hand. Sinclair broadcast company, who are huge affiliates of FOX is literally is about to own 73% of all the TV channels. (Don\'t yet, but soon might, regardless who you like only one source of information should be scary as shit) There is plenty of videos where newscasters say the same exact thing to like 90 different cities. Claiming "fake news". NET NEUTRALITY actively STOPS our ISPs from controlling what we see on the internet, and not turning our internet into cable TV. EVERY democrat voted to keep it, so the government can\'t control what we see. ALL but 3 republicans voted to keep it. THAT\'S NOT A COINCIDENCE. Look up the votes. GET MONEY OUT OF POLITICS OR HAVE TO SAY WHERE ITS FROM?\n(Literally from the .gov SENATE website)\n\nCampaign Finance Disclosure Requirements\n For  Against\nRep  0  39\nDem  59  0\n\nDISCLOSE Act\n For  Against\nRep  0  45\nDem  53  0\n\nBackup Paper Ballots - Voting Record\n For  Against\nRep  20  170\nDem  228  0\n\nBipartisan Campaign Reform Act\n For  Against\nRep  8  38\nDem  51  3\n\nSets reasonable limits on the raising and spending of money by electoral candidates to influence elections (Reverse Citizens United)\n For  Against\nRep  0  42\nDem  54  0\n\n Time and time again Rs say they are for it and vote against EVERY TIME. It\'s on .Gov websites. It\'s on live TV, their votes. IF YOU WANT TO HIDE THINGS YOU ARE NOT PLAYING FAIR.\n\nPeople who think the FBI is part of the "deep state". Why the fuck would Comey and the FBI, if part of that, reopen the Clinton scandal with emails RIGHT before the presidential election, which helped the Republicans HUGELY (see what I did there (:  ) if they were compromised by the "deep state"?\nThere are multiple videos where trump and crew claim that Comey is perfect for the job, astounding at what he does, filled with integrity when he was doing that. Then, they investigate THEIR side and suddenly it\'s a witch hunt? Suddenly it\'s all the opposite and you try to literally, in every way possible, slander them because now they investigate you? They are doing this with Mueller too now. Mueller was in the Military and got a  shit ton of medals. Trump dodged the DRAFT 5 TIMES WHILE WINNING sport trophies. The rich don\'t fight our wars, they just make money off them. (War pigs by OZZY ANYONE?)\n\nHow do people not see the easily irrefutable evidence of this?\nIf I am wrong please tell me because I simply cannot comprehend how this isn\'t completely obvious. Spewing out easily fact check able LIES and half the population believing them is SCARY AS FUCK.\n\nYour posts take literally a Google search and 10 minutes to verify. The Wall Street Journal was voted by Republicans AND Democrats to be the most trustworthy news site of them all. They are SLAMMING this administration. REPUBLICANS on FOX recently said SPY-GATE was bogus. Fox has NEVER done that shit. They are looking for an "out", when the investigation comes to light. If they don\'t find Trump personally colluded, then I WILL SIDE WITH YOU. But please, please, please, if it does, hold him accountable.\n\nI implore people to PLEASE google and read up on votes, issues, and the like so we can all have intelligent conversation about this. Conspiracy theories are just that because they lack literal evidence. PLEASE hold your party accountable no matter WHICH SIDE. If we start a precedent that our parties can lie to us, break the law without consequence then THE OTHER PARTY CAN DO IT TOO IF THEY HAVE A MAJORITY AND ITS THE END OF OUR DEMOCRACY. STOP hating your fellow Americans and start listening to them. Stop fighting them and try to reach a common ground. WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER, not against each other to get out of this. No one is NOT accountable for their actions, regardless of party or pride.\n\nI know almost no one will read this far but I\'m literally to the point of begging that people get more involved, read more, try to explore more on the internet, other countries pages, see who is right most of the time from UNBIASED sources.\n\nOtherwise we are doing the exact opposite of what our founding fathers actively did and fought against. Blind loyalty isn\'t a democracy, it\'s fascism.\n\nIf you don\'t believe anything I\'ve said, LOOK IT UP. PROVE ME WRONG BY POSTING WEBSITES THAT ARE MIDDLE GROUND, and PROVEN TO BE!! NOT OBVIOUSLY BIASED. (Washington Post is most def more Democrat, but it\'s simple numbers on this article, not opinionated journalism. There is a huge difference. You may even think more tariffs are good! I don\'t want to come off as being hypocritical so I edited this in to explain it\'s not just this post, it\'s everywhere) It seems independents and everyone who has no political affiliation DOESN\'T like this shit. Prove me wrong without obvious propaganda. Show me Wall Street Journal defending this shit.\n\nWe need to stop attacking our neighbors and friends. We need to have compassion for each other again. Become a nation again. They are actively and successfully dividing us and I seriously want other opinions on this. Lets have a conversation without attacks or anger. Lets grow together as a nation.'
"I like how you used ALL CAPS as BAIT for the OLD PEOPLE that realize that ALL CAPS mean it's PROBABLY FACTS. Also HILLARY? NO? NO HILLARY? WHY NO HILLARY? BUT ALL CAPS. "
'My dad was a life long Democrat.    At age 76 he voted for Trump.   \n\nI couldn’t understand why.    \n\nA few months later he was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.   He passed last spring.  \n\nThis is not a joke.    I believe the two are related.  '
'Very well put. It has turned into "us against them" mentality and that is the main problem. As long as there is segregation of American people these assholes in power take more and more and get away with it. I think a huge flaw with Dems on Trump supporters/Republicans is to just shit on them, not a good way to win anyone over.'
"One of my co-workers that I talked to over lunch a couple of weeks ago came to me today while I was rounding and said he cannot support the GOP any longer. He's a doctor and I'm sure liked a lot of the policies up until ZTE and the tariffs. Now he's pissed because it threatens him financially.  \n\nTwo of my aunts married hog farmers and both live in Iowa. That's five total that I can think of that will not vote for the GOP in 2018 and possibly 2020. Now that I live in IL my vote will be meaningless. "
"I like what you have to say but Sinclair doesn't own Fox. They own a lot of local Fox affiliate stations but they don't actually own Fox. I only point this out because I think any anti Trump posts ought to be rigorously fact checked so the argument is as solid as possible. These 'fake news' loonies shouldn't be given ANY ammunition to call their battle cry on our posts."
'"TLDR" Pay attention to what is actually going on and you will hate Trump and the GOP.'
"I've stopped posting stuff like this to social media and avoided political topics altogether. I had one coworker who was an awesome dude. He always knew how to make us laugh. We loved going on business trips with him because he'd always try to make the trip fun. Everyone loved him and he was always looking for something to say or do to crack us all up. \n\nHe resigned and moved on but we reconnected on Facebook. He posted some of his right wing sean Hannity BS on Facebook and we argued about it. Later I blocked him on Facebook so I wouldn't have to read this shit. About a year later I got a message from his wife telling me that he'd taken his own life and had battled depression for many years.\n\nI recalled how he never wanted to go back to his room when we went on trips and how he looked bleary-eyed in the morning. I assumed that he just wasn't sleeping well but in hindsight I think he may have been crying. It hurts when I think that the last conversation I had with my friend was a heated argument about taxes. That was years ago but I still won't engage in political discussions with my friends online anymore."
'But what about dead babies? /s'
"This type of huge rant is with no facts except tons of references to how OTHER people think it is why the fake news can't win. "
'I would just say that drawing hard lines in the sand and living with a us vs them is dangerous and a big contributing factor to the division we have in this country right now. I catch myself doing it because it’s really hard not to, but we can’t just shit all over people we disagree with politically even if it feels completely justified. \n\nI 100% understand being infuriated by people like your friend who are pro trump despite seeming to be reasonable people otherwise. Almost every action of this administration has been self serving for a select few, and damaging to the freedoms and futures of the rest. But the way to combat this administration is to be patient with those who have fallen prey to the propaganda complex built by pro business, alt right individuals and groups. \n\nThese people rely on division. They need Americans to hate one another and spend their time squabbling with one another so they can pass their regulatory and legislative agenda. They’ve been successfully doing this for years, weakening our democracy along the way. Driving stakes between yourself and others around you just plays into their hands. \n\nClosing your friend out because he has bought into the comprehensive scam that is Trump and many members of the contemporary GOP isn’t the right approach in my mind. That just drives him further into the arms of this extremely well funded and widespread propaganda network. People need to pull together, not apart. If he is only ever hanging out with people similarly on the hook, being fed the same twisted narratives and half truths, he never has a realistic chance of realizing how much he is being lied too, and how much this country, and others around the world are being hurt by similar political movements that seek to weaken democratic forces. \n\nMy advice would be to avoid inflammatory topics if you can. Avoid the urge to bring up trump in an aggressive or confrontational manner. Treat him like the friend that he is, and see if you can \nween him off the lies he’s been fed, slowly but surely. The GOP has the firm base that is has that exasperates us because those people don’t hear the other side at all, the lies they hear are constantly reinforced by the echo chamber they live in. You have a chance to give your friend the other dude if the story, it’s just gonna take a lot of restraint from you. '
'Ask your friend about these Trump promises:\n _____________________\nHe\'d build a wall and have Mexico pay for it.\n\nHe\'d pass a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan.\n\nHe\'d get manufacturing jobs back from China.\n \nHis tax plan will give everyone a $4,000 raise. \n\nHe had a better, lower cost health-care plan that covered everyone.\n\nHe\'d lower the costs of drugs and prescriptions.\n\nHe\'d be the only Republican who wouldn\'t cut Medicare, Social Security or Medicaid.\n\nHe\'d stop "catch and release"\n\nOnly bring in the best people.\n\nHe\'d close the hedge fund loophole. \n\nHe\'d ban staff from foreign lobbying.\n\nHe\'d ban Pay to Play.\n\nTear up NAFTA day 1.\n\nNever negotiate for the TPP\n\nNo US troops in Syria.\n\nHe\'d "drain the swamp."\n\nHe\'d be too busy working at the White House to go golfing.\n\nHe had a plan to defeat ISIS within 30 days.\n\nHe\'d release his tax returns.\n\nHe\'d bring back coal.\n\nHe wouldn\'t rely on executive orders.\n '
"It's racism.  Your  dad has ALWAYS felt that way.  I live in Trump country and have had people say we should line up brown people and shoot them.\n\nThey have ALWAYS been like that.  45 allowed the silent unstated racism to flow because now it has validation.  \n\nThey are racists, operating on a deeply irrational level.\n\nRACISM."
"This is really disturbing, and sad, and I agree.  I am all for compassion, but trying to relate to and have compassion for another human being, vs. someone who has been absorbed into the cog of a hateful, racist national movement, is much more difficult.  Arguably, that person needs even more compassion, but on an order higher than I'm capable of mustering up.  We need another Gandhi or Martin Luther King, Jr. or something."
'I’m really sorry to hear this. A lot of us are in the same boat. I haven’t been able to speak to my Mom about politics in years. However, having almost lost her a year ago, I’ve decided that being able to spend time with her is more important than how terribly wrong she is politically. \nIt may be that I’ve had time to get to that point (since she’s been this way for a while), but in order for me to still have a Mom, we have to pretend there are no politics. Yes, her opinions on a lot of issues HORRIFY me. No, I’m never going to change her (Gratz to you, by the way, OP). Yes, she does try to bring up politics; I literally ignore her. This is how I cope. \n\nEdit: stupid autocorrect '
"Lots of people never went.  I believe there was some bushy president recently who manged to avoid it too.  Considering how much the war was hated by everyone back then (and I was one who hated it) it isn't a stigma like this meme suggests.  Hell, loads of folks ran to Canada and claimed refugee status or just plain hid to avoid it. \n\nWhile I honor those who served, America should never have been in the Vietnam War.  Ever. "
'It was an unjust shitty war that we should not have been in'
'Draft dodging from a moral perspective (eg war is immoral, sending the poor to fight it for the rich is immoral) - 👍🏾\n\nDraft dodging and claiming POWs aren’t heroes and “I’ll be the best for the military ever” - fuck off '
'At the time though?! Did the general public know how fucked up it was to go over there?'
'Draft dodging is fine\nDraft dodging and dissing veterans, insulting a war hero over  his service is not... He could be a bit humble about it.\n\nBernie is.'

'Not to mention using the "pointing out America\'s flaws insults the troops" argument on critics like with the NFL controversy only a year after running a campaign where he explicitly insulted plenty of troops. \n\nWhat a national shame we\'re all living through. '
'The bodies still came home ... try the google machine on Vietnam war protests. \n\nProbably the greatest inter-generational conflict in US history .. the old sent the young to die. The young wanted nothing to do with the old guys war (generally).'
"Yes.\n\nThat's the short answer. The long answer has to do with the fact that this was the first major US war during which televisions existed and general massification of media was a significant culture facet. The Vietnam war received sanitized coverage certainly, but awareness of the horrors existed long before the end."
"Donald Trump seriously wishes that millions of people would have been kicked off of health insurance, causing thousands of deaths, all to give billionaires more money.\nDonald Trump seriously wants to allow our country's companies to exist with zero environmental regulations, causing millions to die in the future.\nDonald Trump wants to redistribute wealth to the rich from the poor.\nDonald Trump has asked several times from reports why he can't just send nukes at his enemies, killing millions and injuring millions more.\nDonald Trump has increased Barack Obama's drone strike program.\nAnd you are going to complain about somebody joking about him losing half a foot? You know, the idea of being the better person still applies here. "
"Just in case I am missing something, why don't you educate me.   I watched the news as brave men came home only to be reviled.  I saw the protests.  I argued against it then and I do now.   Here is what I know:\n\n1 - Containment was a bad ideology and it failed.\n\n2 - The costs, both financially and in loss of American life were astronomical.  \n\n3 - JFK intended to pull us out.  Johnson was an idiot. Period.  Nixon was handed a terrible situation and made it worse.  \n\n4 - The American involvement prolonged the war, hardened the fighting spirit of the North Vietnamese, harmed the morale of the South Vietnamese Army and still had the same result.  The south may have been able to fight their northern brethren to a draw or at least a peaceful solution but American involvement made that impossible and hurt their spirit too much for them to have any real fight left.\n\n5 - The Americans picked up the gauntlet from the French colonialists, and would have been wise to leave it alone.   The Geneva Accords split the country and then Eisenhower (using his now discredited domino theory as his rationale) was insistent that a US friendly non-communist country was necessary.  History has proved him wrong but even then it was a bad decision based on flawed thinking. \n\nFinally, the thousands of us who lived in that era and saw the almost daily headlines of innocents dying, of women and children dying and American soldiers, conflicted in fighting a war that they couldn't win forced by a government they didn't support in a country they didn't want were treated like murderers when they came home.  Some were, a minuscule few,  but those were the stories the news outlets ran.\n\nListen, I realize that historians are split on this but I stated my opinion and you are the one who should read your books instead of appealing to an authority you don't actually have.

That's who your party rigged an election for. So who needs to wake up? "
"It's a natural result of boot camp.  Every military on Earth has used some form of indoctrination on it's troops to open their minds up to pro war propaganda.  It makes better soldiers that do what they are told without doubt or hesitation when the heat is on, but once their mind is opened up to it, there not a lot that can be done to close it.  All politicians use political propaganda as a natural part of running for office, but Team Trump has been using weaponized military grade propaganda, the specific kind of propaganda that the military mind is trained to respond to, since day 1.  It's why MAGAts seem so ready to kill anyone who isn't a Trump supporter.  We can thank Mike Flynn for that.  \n\n#LOCK HIM UP!  LOCK HIM UP!  LOCK HIM UP!"
'You skipped over the entire first part of the war where Ho Chi Minh moved to Moscow, was indoctrinated in Revolutionary Marxist Communism, then returned to Vietnam to start a war in the streets of his own country.\n\nYou are also skipping over the part where Mao Zedong, the ruler of China, was also indoctrinated by Stalin in the ways of Revolutionary Marxist Communism and seized control of China.\n\nYou also fail to see the fact that Russia was attempting to overthrow as much of the world as possible, and replace legitimate National governments with Marxist puppets.  By holding the line in Vietnam for 10 years, American intervention successfully halted Marxist expansion globally.\n\nYou also completely overlooked the fact that The United States is the only thing standing in the way of Russia just rolling tanks through whatever country Russia wants.\n\nI agree with you that America got pulled into Vietnam by our French Allies, but you are overlooking the fact that our French allies were attacked by a Russian built war machine.  It was in fact the Russians that started the Vietnam war.  We were called in to defend our allies, which is a NOBLE cause.  If Russia had not trained and armed Ho Chi Minh and his army, there would have been no revolution, no war, no 1 million+ dead, so don\'t you fucking dare try to paint America as the bad guy in this!  \n\nThe struggle between Capitalism and Communism is not "an unjust war".  The soldiers who give their lives in this conflict do not "die for nothing".  We are fighting for the Freedom to choose for ourselves who rules us, because that is the only way we can be free.\n'

"If you subscribe to the idea that his campaign was a publicity stunt, wouldn't winning the election be the last thing he'd want?

"Um, I don't mean to be this guy but I don't think using the expression 7 deadly sins when comparing to Jesus is a good idea.

"I dislike Trump as much as the next person, but can we stop calling people the Antichrist just because we don't like them? It's so reductionist and hyperbolic. Nobody is the literal embodiment of evil. People are people, and reducing anyone to being *just* evil robs us of the ability to understand the complexity and internal logic of their motivations. No one does anything specifically to be evil, there are always deeper reasons, and understanding them is important."

'I wish this were the case but unfortunately, mueller cannot fix this situation on his own. Trump’s base will defend him no matter what, we’ve already seen ample evidence of that.\nFurthermore, even after mueller releases his findings and the full extent of trump’s illegal activities is known, congress will likely do nothing about it. Even the house flips and trump, by some miracle, is impeached, the senate won’t vote to remove him from office. He will be left to finish out his term and perhaps even another, and to continue doing immeasurable damage to our democracy. We should have nationwide rapid fire rallies organized for when this happens, similar to those that were organized for the eventuality that trump fires mueller. At the very least, we should make it abundantly clear to congress that if they don’t act to remove him from office, they are blatantly disregarding the wishes of the people and will absolutely not be re-elected. '
"No he doesn't. He's completely ineffective as a president and a goddam wuss."
'He was sentenced to die by his own... the Jews called for his death, while being a Jew himself.'
'Yes, He was "chill with slavery" in a way that subverted the entire construct. At the time, slavery was part of the natural order of society. Jesus and His disciple Paul accepted it as a given, but then said that slaves were fundamentally and spiritually equal with their masters. I have never figured out how Paul\'s letter to Philemon is taken as supporting slavery, for example. While he sends the slave, who has run away to work and be useful with Paul on his missions, back to his master, Philemon is then told to receive him as a brother. How can someone be both a slave and a brother?\n\nThis situation overturns the basis of slavery altogether. When chattel slavery was revived under Christian auspices in the New World, it took a massive set of rationalizations to make it comfortable enough for most believers. They either had to dehumanize their slaves or somehow convince themselves that they were "uplifting" them by hard correction.'
'Christ was chill with slavery. Then Jesus Christ is Putin? '
'Slavery in biblical times was much different than the slavery we know now. Slaves were to be treated as part of the extended family. Jesus was not chill with human trafficking, he was chill with indentured servitude.'
"Well, not to nitpick, but I don't remember any accounts of Jesus condoning slavery. I think your quote is from a letter one of his disciples wrote to a church well after Jesus had been executed, so that may have been more their thoughts than Jesus'.\nThere are parts in the Gospels that contain Jesus talking about slavery, but more so using it as the backdrop of his stories rather than directly condoning it."
"[Wrong.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRmc9IPGmiA)\n\nThe Pharasees were his enemies both literally and figuratively. He challenged their authority by teaching that people could speak directly to God. That was *their* job. He was about to put them out of business. If the Pharasees had beef with someone, they'd usually get their strongmen to start a stoning. That's how it was done. Since they couldn't appear to be the bad guys here, they needed a straw man. Enter Pontious Pilate. Roman governor of a shithole province in the middle of nowhere.\n\nThe Romans didn't *really* give a shit about Yeshua the Nazarene. Just another swarthy 5' tall Jew running around preaching on street corners. The crowds he gathered raised a few eyebrows but that was nothing Roman soldiers weren't used to. With a trumped up charge of Yeshua claiming to be a king, he was sentenced to death. Common under Roman law. That kept the peace amongst the conquered, you see? No leaders of the subjugated means more compliant, tax-paying subjects. Crucifixion is a **ROMAN** method, not Jewish. Pure & simple. Yeshua was set up and the Pharasees covered their asses. They were in power because people believed they were in power. The Romans were in power because they'd fuck you up if you crossed them. Better to make it look like it was another Roman execution. \n\nPersonally, I don't think the historical 'Jesus' was a deity of any kind. Just a dude. A nice dude with some good ideas for an otherwise savage, brutal world. I don't think he died while he was nailed up like a painting. Scripture says he was up there for a few hours. Then a storm came around. Or an earthquake. Something crazy happened. Crazy but natural. Dumb luck. Remember that it takes **days** to die from crucifixion, not hours. That's what made it so terrifying. His buddies probably made the most of the confusion and hustled his ass out of there. A few days later he could totally be walking around saying goodbye to his friends. Clearly, he'd have to skip town quickly or he'd be dead for real. Can't embarrass anybody by being alive if you've been executed. Of *course* he'd still have holes in his hands/wrists/feet from being nailed up. No way wounds would close up that quickly particularly in light of large, handmade Roman nails. Makes the resurrection totally believable to ancient people.  \n\nI'm a former catechist and current atheist/amateur historian. My explanation makes a lot more sense than church doctrine. "
'Nope. Apparently he is the root of narcissism and evil liberalism in modern society according to [Fox News](https://youtu.be/29lmR_357rA).'
"My point wasn't about whether or not it's an accurate description, it's that using that description pigeonholes him as *just* evil, *just* the Antichrist, which prevents us from scrutinizing his real world motives. We need to understand why Trump does what he does in order to fight it, and acting like he's evil gives us an excuse not to understand him."
"So, if the Jews hadn't brought him to court and pushed (multiple times and threatened civil unrest) for the death sentence, the Roman court, who saw no real problem and found no reason for punishment, would have sentenced him to death? I'm sorry, but I guess from a rational standpoint, I have to disagree with you."

"Here's the first time I remember this being reported:\n\n[Donald Trump offered Chris Christie vice president role before Mike Pence, sources say](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-offered-chris-christie-vice-president-role-before-mike-pence/)\n\n>Manafort had arranged for Trump to meet with his first choice for the job on July 13: Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Afterwards, the plans was for Trump and Pence to then fly back to New York together and a formal announcement would be made, a campaign source said of Manafort’s thinking.\n\n>What had previously been reported as a “lucky break” by the New York Times was actually a swift political maneuver devised by the now fired campaign manager. Set on changing Trump’s mind, he concocted a story that Trump’s plane had mechanical problems, forcing the soon-to-be Republican nominee to stay the night in Indianapolis for breakfast with the Pence family on Wednesday morning.\n\n>Swayed by Pence’s aggressive pitch, Trump agreed to ditch Christie and make Pence his VP the following day, according to a source."
"He's not wrong, but Jesus Christ, George Will can go fuck himself."
"You could be correct, but it's worth exploring. So far, I haven't seen any concrete evidence that Pence is directly involved in anything but I find it hard to believe that he was not aware. The whole firing of Flynn for lying to Pence (when Trump already knew) thing is suspect. I'd like to see some more theories and evidence on this. "
"As much as I wish they'd all go down with Trump, for some reason I feel like Pence is too principled (if misguided) to get too wrapped up with that stuff.\n\nIn D&D terms, I'd say Pence was lawful evil while Trump is chaotic evil.  I think Pence has a consistent set of values that includes abiding by the law he probably adheres to pretty strictly.  I'd guess he does so mainly because that is what he thinks a good Christian would do.  \nThis isn't a compliment -- I also assume he's not very smart because he relies on simple rules.  I actually think fluidity of beliefs and actions depending on context and payoff are signs of intelligence.\n\nMy point is: I think Pence is too stupid and morally rigid to be caught up in any of Trump or Manafort's shenanigans."
'Pence is too close with too many already indicted people not to be involved in *something*. I don’t recall any specific allegations against him yet, but they’re all rotten, so he’s gotta be too.'
'Figures the NRA would be involved somehow.  Corrupt bastards would sell an AK47 to a 6-month-old if they could.'

'"For the sake of argument, let\'s leave legality aside for a minute"\n\nWhy? If we aren\'t talking about a crime then what\'s the point of investigating it further? Seriously people have rights and I am not okay with people, groups or organizations being searched without probable cuase for the suspicion of a CRIME. Doing so would violate the 4th amendment of the US constitution and would itself be a CRIME. \n\n"What possible reason could anyone in Russia have to support the NRA" \n\nI have no idea, most likely becuase they don\'t have a reason, but IF they did I wouldn\'t be able to comprehend why, just like I can\'t comprehend why they they would donate 500k to the Clinton foundation. \n\n" I submit to you that what they wanted was to influence the US election"\n\nSo what? That is not a crime, and I know you said to set that aside an all but I just can\'t help but harping on it because it is pretty important, we are talking about something that *may* have happened as if it where the end of the world, when it\'s not only NOT a crime but its something *our* government does to other countries all the time. It\'s not illegal. Sorry but it\'s not.\n\n\n"Do you agree that that\'s probably why Russians would give money to an American gun-rights organization? If you agree, then please tell me, does that bother you?" \n\nIf it\'s true, and that\'s a big IF, no. It doesn\'t because that sort of shit has been probably going on sence the dawn of the cold War. Did the Russians cast counterfeit votes at the ballot office? Did the Russians infiltrate the election HQs and rig the number? I\'d certainly care about that kind of shit. but the Russians allegedly donated money to an American activist organization who advertised for one American candidate over another that the American citizens had the choice of weather or not to vote on? So fucking what.'
"[When Paul Manafort met Ferdinand Marcos in the 1980s, each had something the other wanted. . . . Marcos earmarked huge sums of cash for Reagan’s 1980 and 1984 campaigns — as much as $57 million, according to one claim made to Philippine investigators. There’s no evidence that any cash ever made it into Reagan’s coffers, which would have been illegal since U.S. election laws ban donations from foreigners. And, despite extensive government investigations on both sides of the Pacific into the freewheeling spending of the Marcos regime, there’s never before been much serious inquiry of what ultimately happened to the cash intended for political contributions. ](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/2016-donald-trump-paul-manafort-ferinand-marcos-philippines-1980s-213952)\n\nYeah, that Manafort.

">Uranium deal just heard about last week, not yet investigated at all\n\nNo... this was written about years ago in Clinton Cash.  The article about the FBI colluding with clinton is what came out last week.\n\nLocking up politicians has to be approached carefully.  You can end up with far more corruption if opposition parties are locked up.  You also end up with the current stupidity of trying to overrule the vote via impeachment.  It's a complete waste of time.\n\nIt's all a pointless distraction.  Nobody is going to jail except maybe some lackeys."
'Political leaders should be given a fair degree of leeway, certainly. We can\'t have lawyers breathing down their necks all the time and expect them to do their jobs. But if Trump did work with the Russians to "influence" (steal) the election, possibly promising them something in return, he has massively exceeded this leeway and should be in prison. We\'ll see what Mueller turns up. At this point it\'s too early to tell exactly what happened, remember that the Watergate investigation took about three years. \n\nRight now we know that Russia did meddle in an effort to help Trump win. We know that Trump\'s people (including Don Jr, Kushner, Sessions, Flynn, Manafort, and several others) had several meetings with Russian representatives which they conveniently forgot about when legally required to disclose them. We know that Trump pressured the director of the FBI to stop investigating the whole affair, and fired him because of the Russia investigation (in his words). We know that Trump\'s campaign manager has had secret illegal deals with the Russian government in the past. All of this, taken together, should be enough to raise an eyebrow for anyone, even if it\'s too soon to say what exactly happened and who did it.\n\nIt\'s also misleading to pretend that this uranium thing is in the same league as what Trump\'s accused of. Go ahead and investigate it sure, maybe they\'ll turn something up, maybe they won\'t. It\'s a deliberately misleading "both sides" argument which just doesn\'t hold up. The Russia investigation has found a lot of damning evidence, the uranium thing hasn\'t. And regardless, both Hillary and Trump can be criminals. Pointing fingers at the "other side" is deflection.'

'Conspiracy with a foreign power to influence an election through either direct compensation or quid pro quo is a federal crime. Depending on how deep and detailed and repetitive the acts of conspiracy and any exchange of money/influence then it is prosecutable. that is basically what they seem to be investigating. \n\n\ne.g. you agree for Putin (or some other foreign power) to peddle out their disinformation campaigns in exchange for Russian sanction relief then that is bad stuff and probably is conspiracy.\n\n\nthe word “collusion “ is a journalistic term. conspiracy is the more legal term and is what would be prosecuted.\n\n\nso yeah the “collusion isn’t illegal “ is really just not worth arguing. it’s when government officials start using the term conspiracy in proceedings then shit is about to go down.\n\n\nBasically there are myriad anti-influence statutes probably being compared versus all the testimonies and plea agreements and investigations. So they are seeing what may apply and to whether it is of such a degree to warrant charges and prosecution. in general, foreign powers involved in us elections is legally wrong. there was somewhat of a dust up around saudis raising campaign money in the 90s/00s ... but i forget at the moment and too lazy to look. :P'

'Growing up as a “white minority” is certainly nothing like what the cowards are afraid of.  You fit in the way people do- befriend people with similar values and have a spine.  The fear of black Americans is in some ways understandable, there’s a higher poverty rate in black communities and crime follows poverty.  Add that nearly all ethnic communities tend to be tough on outsiders and you have the stereotypes. All of which is manageable and not an issue if you’re thoughtful and capable.  \n\nJust as there are some places that black Americans don’t leave the car, the same is true for whites.  Both are wrong and need changing, but there’s definitely more history and prevalence in modern society of white on black racism.  Whites have blocks to avoid, blacks have cities.\n\nThe hysteria is simple to understand through a historical lens.  If you’re simultaneously calling a group weak and dangerous, you’re pretty well a sack of racist crap and not a viable modern human.  Be thoughtful when encountering problematic elements and you’ll be ok regardless of what angle you’re coming from.'

"you left out the most likely possible outcome: there was no collusion with Russia by the Trump campaign.\n\nAnd by the way EVEN IF THERE WERE it wouldn't break any law, according to constitutional expert and liberal lawyer Alan Dershowitz.\n\nHe should not be impeached just because he makes you mad or you disagree with his policies, because he was duly elected as President. Suck it up and work on voting him out, just like many of us did when we had to suffer through 8 years of destruction from Obama.\n\nThe FBI/DOJ are clearly political and used their power to try to prevent Trump from being elected and when that didn't work they used their power to try to stop Trump from succeeding by hanging the special counsel around his neck.\n\nYou think you're being rational but you're not."
'Then Trump should cooperate fully and give us the whole story. He’s confronted with these people in his inner circle who were clearly compromised and he claims not to know him. Irrefutable proof comes out that he in fact personally worked with them, and he changes his story. He could put this whole thing to bed, but instead he works actively to discredit the people investigating him. Why?\n\nIf the meeting allegedly taking place in Trump tower over the Magnitsky Act actually took place, Trump and his ilk would be guilty of violating section 957 of the Espionage Act, but that’s not really the concern here. How comfortable are you with a candidate allowing the electoral process and America sovereignty itself to be violated by one of our rivals *just to get elected*? Do you see why people care that the investigation continue unimpeded? Even if Trump isn’t impeached, we don’t want this to happen again.\n\nI first heard that talking point about the FBI when GOP congressmen started pushing that narrative about the memo that turned out to be a pure Nothingburger. Again, why the push to discredit an investigation that’s already indicted several accused Russian assets and convicted another? Why is the president so terrified of what will come of it?\n\nSuck it up and let the investigation reach its verdict.\n\n\n\n'

"The reason I posted the article is it is the same method of gathering that got the Clinton emails. Its proof they gave it to Cambridge. Since the Clinton emails follow that same line, its easy to see. Israel went to war with America over JCPOA and Clinton was a key diplomat. To kill jcpoa israel enlisted Russia uae Saudi to help smear democrats and get a republican who would end it and push Palestine off Jerusalem and a 2 state solution. That's why trump Kushner are bent over for Netanyahu and why we see a move in Russia's support in Syria and Iran at the behest of Bibi. That's why Iran has gone to the EU, Russia's enemy. Its why all prozion democrats weren't effected despite having top seats in the DNC. Only democrats who supported JCPOA were leaked hacked. It is why Mueller has indicted a few Israel is and subpoenaed 17 Israel is on the matter. Why come to the Mueller sub to discredit the investigation as only Russia. It's much bigger.\n\nhttps://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/spying-israel-congress-netanyahu-217207\n\nhttps://www.haaretz.com/whdcMobileSite/us-news/.premium-trump-russia-mueller-probe-the-israel-connections-1.6116639"
"Treason: the crime of betraying one's country, especially by attempting to kill the sovereign or overthrow the government.\n\nLet’s assume he got information from the Russians. How exactly is that betraying ones country? It’s not a tactic I prefer, but it’s not illegal and certainly not treason."
'Trumps ego is way to big to step down. I imagine he will try and drag everyone down. When Mueller announces his findings trump will complain on twitter about it and i hopw not but he could only stoke the fire of us vs them. '
"I think it's that Russia isn't a hive mind. It's perfectly reasonable for a representative to tell the truth when asked a question. That's all that this is. It doesn't necessarily mean it's a tactic.\n\n\nAnd I also think Russia has already got what it wanted. It doesn't want the US to destabilize. The world's most powerful military being led by a destabilized government is likely no major nation state's desire. That just makes Russia a target even more.\n\n\nI think Putin just wanted to be taken seriously. I think the Russian people, after a humiliating collapse and then economic depression and embarrassing alcoholic leadership, and *then* geopolitical embarrassments like Iraq, Kosovo, color revolutions... Russia and the Russian people just wanted to be taken seriously so that their threats (like during Iraq and Kosovo) will be taken seriously.\n\n\nI also think the US and the West in general is ludicrously naive sometimes. First of all, the US 100% has more efforts to sway Russian public opinion than *anything* Russia did. Simply, Russia isn't a true democracy so the results aren't as dramatic. And second of all, we all do our best to blame Russia or whoever for the fact that, undeniably, tens of millions of our neighbors and family members intentionally voted for a complete idiot that was caught bragging about sexual harassment on tape. Like anywhere else in the developed world our situation would even be *possible*."
"No your right. And both sides are playing right into they're hands. We need to arrest the corrupt, and prosecute them. But sadly I don't think any politicians will be jailed, besides a handful of trump admins. We need to also Start an actual dialogue with the other side, but its hard when both sides are in hysterics.

'I think that thinking Putin "just wanted to be taken seriously" is ridiculously naive. Russia has goals. Putin has plans.'
'The Russian people didn’t work to undermine our election. Their government did. That sort of rhetoric is a barrier to the fact that people in general don’t hate each other. Governments get belligerent towards each other, politicians amplify the emotions, and people pay the price. It’s just a big geopolitical and financial game to these people. It’s corrupt and negligent.'
'The Russian people are, by all accounts, very supportive of the current regime in Russia. Russia is a sprawling diverse federation of many different communities. Sure, any semblance of dissent is crushed instantly. But if there was widespread dissatisfaction, that system would collapse. Easily.'

"First of all, Bannon isn't a neo-libertarian anything, the man is an outspoken fascist. His views and his positions align almost exactly with those of any garden variety fascist, to the point of racial and ethnic hatred. Secondly, I am firmly of the mind that he'll strike a plea deal. He's compromised through and through, knew everything about the meetings with the Russians, and likely arranged a good bit of it.

He believed he could control Trump, and now that he's out this seems more like burning Trump out of spite, not an anarchist plot."
"He's not a huge fan, but I don't think that's the direct reason why. I would guess Rand's underlying philosophy of objectivism and atheism (rationalism, whatever) doesn't sit well with him.

I think not.\n\nTrump is not only a crook, he\'s a huge dick to **everybody.**  He\'s probably insulted you as part of some larger group already and you haven\'t even realized it yet.  That\'s why everybody (including the FBI whose director Trump appointed) hates him **now.**  In the past he was clearly *just* popular enough to win the presidency, but all the man knows how to do is fuck up.  He\'ll fuck up right up to and through the mid-terms, he\'ll fuck up until he gets impeached or 2020 rolls around after two years of a lame duck.  \n\nThen again, Trump passed one bill in his first year, so he\'s already the first first-year lame duck president.  All he\'s done beside that is repeal and destroy and tweet from his shitter during "executive time."  Oh, and spend way more money golfing/vacations than Obama, whom Trump berated for the same thing.  Not to mention Trump security detail is spending that money at **Trump properties**, meaning he\'s lining his pockets with taxpayer money.  I\'m surprised that people aren\'t more outraged by this fact alone.'

By having the government strictly pick what food is included and delivering it, it does multiple things in the dumbest and least conservative way possible... it removes the free market because the government will have contracts with a handful of food producers and one distributor, while current food stamps spreads out evenly to food producers. Dole competes with Del Monte for canned foods, but only one would win the gigantic contract to provide for the prepackaged food. It cuts out the grocery store. Local economic activity will decrease. Lastly, picking what people get with no regard to their needs isn’t just tone deaf, it’s dangerous.

'This isn\'t a smoking gun against Trump or his campaign campaign in its entirety. Evidence does not equal proof. For example, in a trial the burden of proof is met by providing sufficient evidence. This is just one piece. \n\nThat said, this is proof that at least one member of his campaign (Papadopoulos) was attempting to collude with the Russian government; he admitted to doing so. It is also evidence that higher-up campaign officials were aware of his actions, and the campaign supervisor ([subsequently identified as Sam Clovis](http://www.businessinsider.com/sam-clovis-polite-trump-russia-george-papadopoulos-2017-10)) urged him to continue in those efforts, telling him to "make the trip [to Russia], if it is feasible."\n\nIf it can be shown that this chain of events led to campaign finance violations or other crimes, or even that a significant step was taken in that direction, both Papadopoulos and Clovis can legally be charged with conspiracy to commit those crimes. But the main point is that Trump can pound on the table screaming there was "no collusion" by his campaign team all he wants - it\'s already been admitted by someone that was on his campaign, and by legal standards, resulting conspiracy charges can be brought against his campaign supervisor, Clovis, as well. \n\nThe "no collusion" argument is dead and buried. The only question now is how many members of the campaign were involved, and whether Trump himself was aware and/or participating.'
'Yes and no. "Collusion" isn\'t a crime, per se. It\'s being used as an ordinary word with its ordinary meaning. The document actually does show collusion, but it may not have been illegal collusion ("illegal collusion" could take a number of forms, but in this context it\'s most likely to be criminal conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws by obtaining "dirt" on Hillary Clinton). I picked those quotes because I didn\'t want the comment to be too long. If you read them in the context of the rest of the document, they are far more damning\n\nThe main theme of the stipulations is that Papadopoulos was talking to Russians in an effort to obtain "thousands of emails" with "dirt" on Hillary Clinton. That constitutes a violation of 52 U.S.C. § 30121 (by soliciting a contribution from a foreign national). That was the substance of the meeting Papadopoulos was trying to set up. The document is unclear about whether Clovis or any other campaign members were aware that this was the purpose of the meeting, but it seems likely they did.  Also, Papadopoulos lied about all of this when interviewed by the FBI. If he\'s willing to commit a crime to lie about it, it stands to reason that he was attempting to cover up a crime. The footnote also indicates knowledge of wrongdoing, since the higher level campaign officials wanted to use a low-level campaign member to avoid "sending a signal." Finally, Papadopoulos was communicating with his superiors about setting up an "off the record" meeting between the Trump campaign and Russia. Why would it need to be off the record? And to tie in others in the campaign, he was urged to "make the trip, if it is feasible."'
"Trump drafted the response his son would use to address the revelation of the meeting. Trump was adamant they say it was only about adoptions. If anything, that can signal a desire to mislead the public and investigators, which could be another case of obstruction.\n\nAlso, why be so adamant the meeting was about a particular subject when Trump wasn't there or had no clue of the meeting? Or he did, which signals the meeting was never disclosed and a Presidential candidate didn't think it was bad to coordinate meetings with Russians for damaging intel."
"You can move the goalposts all you want. It doesn't matter. Papadopoulos was on the campaign. [Trump even tweeted out a picture of himself meeting with the guy](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/715725628465680386). And Sam Clovis, a major campaign official, was directing his actions. If he, for example, intended for Papadopoulos to push for the release of those emails, he's guilty of criminal conspiracy."
'>conspired\n\nThank you. Can we stop using the word collusion and use a word that has actual criminal implications?'
"The quid pro quo is illegal, if they exchanged help from Russia for dirt on Hillary that would be illegal yes hands down.  But accepting dirt on an opponent as collusion is not a crime, giving something in return for it is.  Now that I think about it, there's no way there wasn't a quid pro quo for that dirt, they most likely did do that"
"Which was how I thought it would've been received. \n\nGuess I pissed off someone."
"i was banned for posting numbers and links to report voting fraud back in november 2016.  things like the DOJ's voting hotline.  "
"Also for any talk that an idiot might interpret as a call for violence, rather than an observation that violence will occur if situations get worse, which is why I'm *perma*-banned.\n\nThe *perma* is what really chaps my chittles. Fuck that judgmental, sneering little clod. If he wanted to get off on his power, banning me for a couple of weeks would have sufficed."
"The death of a person's narrative is more devastating and less cause for the ban hammer.\n\nYou can do it.  I have faith."
'Though I would agree that there is probably dirt there and that it is likely that collusion took place (if the signal was for Russia to back off, there\'d be no reason to lie about it), however, the explanation doesn\'t need to hold much water, it only needs to provide a shred of plausibility and it\'s enough to provide reasonable doubt.\n\nSo it would be my position that this does not represent "proof of collusion", it just looks and smells a hell of a lot like it.'
'Collusion in this case is a term the media is using to describe the situation where the Trump campaign agreed to give Russia some kind of favorable treatment in return for Russia helping the Trump campaign through propaganda and/or other illegal activities, such as hacking. \n\nThat\'s what we\'re discussing when we say "collusion." \n\nThis document doesn\'t show collusion in that sense, or in any sense, really. Talking with Russians isn\'t illegal in any sense and political candidates regularly meet with other foreign leaders; it\'s not illegal at all to meet with Putin or to have a campaign setup that meeting. \n\n>The main theme of the stipulations is that Papadopoulos was talking to Russians in an effort to obtain "thousands of emails" with "dirt" on Hillary Clinton. That constitutes a violation of 52 U.S.C. § 30121 (by soliciting a contribution from a foreign national).\n\nPossibly, but that hasn\'t really been established. Papadapulous hasn\'t plead guilty to that; he plead guilty to lying to the FBI. That also doesn\'t provide any evidence that the Trump campaign told Russia they\'d give them favorable treatment (such as dropping sanctions) for doing so. The Russians could have done it on their own, out of hatred for HRC, and some underlings could have told Papadapulous. \n\n>Papadopoulos lied about all of this when interviewed by the FBI.\n\nIt\'s not clear what he lied about. it seems like he lied about some meeting, but it wasn\'t clear that he was asked about all of this. \n\n>If he\'s willing to commit a crime to lie about it, it stands to reason that he was attempting to cover up a crime.\n\nThe court of law doesn\'t work that way.

'It’s conspiracy to defraud the United States.  That’s what the Russians were charged with.  That’s the crime that collusion is.'

You just picked one of many allegations of collusion - the hardest one to prove -  and decided you got to use that as your goalpost. Just because a quid pro quo has been alleged doesn\'t mean it has to be proven for collusion-related crimes to be proven. Hell, the Special Counsel\'s mandate instructs him to investigate (among other things) "any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump."  "Links and/or coordination" is a more accurate summation of "collusion" for our purposes.\n\n>This document doesn\'t show collusion in that sense, or in any sense, really. Talking with Russians isn\'t illegal in any sense and political candidates regularly meet with other foreign leaders; it\'s not illegal at all to meet with Putin or to have a campaign setup that meeting.\n\nYou\'re not going to use reasoning skills even a little bit? Talking with Russians in an effort to obtain damaging information about a political adversary is a crime. Do you think there\'s any chance whatsoever that Papadopoulos wasn\'t trying to get Russia to turn over or simply publish those emails?\n\n>Possibly, but that hasn\'t really been established. Papadapulous hasn\'t plead guilty to that; he plead guilty to lying to the FBI. That also doesn\'t provide any evidence that the Trump campaign told Russia they\'d give them favorable treatment (such as dropping sanctions) for doing so. The Russians could have done it on their own, out of hatred for HRC, and some underlings could have told Papadapulous.\n\nDo you know what the point of a plea bargain is? Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to a lesser offense in exchange for helping the FBI as a cooperating witness. And when did I ever say anything about a quid pro quo?\n\n>It\'s not clear what he lied about. it seems like he lied about some meeting, but it wasn\'t clear that he was asked about all of this.\n\nWrong:\n\n>>*False Statement: PAPADOPOULOS Met the Professor and Learned About Russian "Dirt " Before He Joined Lhe Campaign*\n\n>>During his interview with the FBI, defendant PAPADOPOULOS acknowledged that he met the Professor and that the Professor told him the Russians had "dirt" on then candidate Clinton in the form of "thousands of emails," but defendant PAPADOPOULOS stated multiple times that those communications occurred prior to when he joined the Campaign. Defendant PAPADOPOULOS told the FBI: "This isn\'t like he [the Professor]\'s messaging me while I\'m in April with Trump"; " I wasn\'t even on the Trump team, that wasn\'t even on the radar"; " I wasn\'t even on Trump\'s orbit[] at this time"; and "This was a year ago, this was before I even got with Trump." He also said it was a "very strange coincidence" to be told of the "dirt" before he started working for the Campaign.\n\n>The court of law doesn\'t work that way. Mueller will need something concrete. He will need explicit evidence of the terms of the conspiracy. Saying "he lied about X, therefor, he\'s guilty of every accusation thrown at him" doesn\'t hold up in court.\n\nFirst of all, we\'re not in court. We\'re debating what we believe is likely to have happened, not what can be proven by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.  That said, apart from your strawman at the end there, that is exactly how it works. A crime may be proven by direct and/or circumstantial evidence. That alone may not be sufficient evidence to get a conviction, but we don\'t know everything that Mueller knows. It would absolutely be part of the case against Papadopoulos if this went to trial. If Papadopoulos was on trial and he was cross-examined on why he felt it was necessary to lie to the FBI, he better have a good reason or it\'s not going to go well for him.\n\n>Again, not illegal. I am allowed to communicate with any Russian through any channel I want, whether it\'s TOR, or some kind of encrypted email communication.\n\nIt\'s not illegal in and of itself. We\'re using our critical thinking skills here to determine his motivations for setting something up off the record. Knowing what we know, is it likely that he and the campaign were trying to hide something illegal? It\'s not a slam dunk, but it\'s some pretty bad circumstantial evidence when combined with the rest of the facts in the Statement of the Offense.\n\n>The court of law doesn\'t work that way. Mueller will need to prove why a meeting was "off the record," not just assume the reason.\n\nWhich he would do by putting this evidence together with other evidence to lead the jury to the conclusion that it was for illegal purposes.\n\nMaybe try not to lecture a lawyer about how a court of law works next time, especially when we\'re not actually talking about proving up a case in court.'

Mueller doesn't have to do this and neither does rosenstein so that argument is totally flawed. He seems more reasonable but I don't think he understands the fundamentals of how this works. They would have no incentive at all to continue this if it was totally fabricated bullshit. "
'If Comey was only fired because he was "pursuing a BS investigation that began under Obama" then why did Trump say he was fired because of "this whole Russia thing" even he was never prompted to talk about Russian-related aspects of the investigation in an Interview with Lester Holt. You could argue Trump fired Comey specifically to bring on Mueller. I don\'t really see your brothers argument here?'
">Comey was only fired because he was pursuing a BS investigation that began under Obama.\n\nThis logic only works if you believe that Comey was investigating Trump. Truth is, he never was. Obama and those within his administration had been giving a general warning by the Intelligence Community that the Kremlin was trying to interfere in the 2016 election. Both party nominees for president were also warned. Obama wanted to warn the American people at large, but Mitch McConnell got in the way of his desire to issue a joint non-partisan statement. Regardless, Comey's FBI was investigating this issue, as they should have been.\n\nFast-forward to the transition, Trump was further warned by Obama that the guy he tapped to be his National Security Adviser, General Michael Flynn, was possibly compromised or could at least be easily susceptible to blackmail by foreign powers. Trump ignored this warning. He was warned again after taking office by Acting Attorney General Sally Yates. He ignored it again and fired Yates shortly after. With no accusation towards Trump himself, it was clear to people investigating the general issue of Russian influence that something was not quite right about Flynn. Flynn was only fired after it became public, but he was still the target of an investigation by the FBI. As the months passed, it was becoming clear that more and more members of Trump's inner circle were involved in the alleged interference. The investigation into Kremlin interaction was turning up too many links to his associates (like Manafort, Prince, Kushner, Don Jr.) for it to all be one big coincidence. Again, there was still no actual accusation towards the now president and no active investigation into him. Regardless, he fired the FBI director who was heading the investigation that was quite clearly getting oddly close to him. He then went on to say that that was the exact reason for the termination in and interview with Lester Holt. Since Sessions had already recused himself because of the fact that he was one of the people that the investigation noticed was having contact with the Kremlin, Rosenstein was by default in charge of all things Russian interference investigation, and thus had the power to appoint a special counsel. He could have left it to the now Acting FBI Director McCabe, but there's a noticeable conflict of interest in the FBI investigating why their own director just got sacked. And that's why we have Mueller.\n\n**TL;DR:** Trump was afraid of an investigation not even directly about him. Whether he himself is guilty or just paranoid and saw it as an attack on his legitimacy as president is something that deserves to be investigated, because he took action that indicates that one of those two things is true in firing Comey."
'* You can start with the fact that Comey was a republican, and most of the FBI has been republican. Mueller wasn\'t hired as response to Comey being fired, but as a response to the intel community finding evidence of Russian interference by way of fake news posts and advertising on social media.

'They are gonna be in quite the crisis when Trump is inevitably taken out by a cheeseburger.'
'The worst part for me is that... even if you *do* engage a Trump supporter in a dialogue it never ends well. This was me the other day, paraphrased:\n\nMe: Child prisons are bad\n\nTrump Supporter: Obama did it.\n\nMe: Obama did bad things but not this, and also that\'s irrelevant to our current conversation.\n\nTS: Media blowing this out of proportion.\n\nMe: Here\'s court documents showing children being tazed, sexually abused, and injected with drugs.\n\nTS: The kids are being coached, fake news.\n\nMe: Here\'s three sources showing you that you\'re wrong about that.\n\nTS: I don\'t want to argue any more.\n\nMe: Also here\'s a source about the head of ICE saying that these children are basically being tortured to scare other immigrants into leaving.\n\nTS: Fake news, MAGA!\n\nThis is an **actual conversation** I had at work. It is in no way exaggerated. He literally said at one point he didn\'t want to argue any more and then when I pushed back with even more evidence that what he was defending was indefensible, he literally said "MAGA!" in an attempt to piss me off. Which I mean it did. How *utterly fucked in the head* do you have to be to want to destroy the constitution (even foreigners get due process here) **and** want to torture children just to "own the libs?" It\'s disgusting.\n\n“Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.”\n\n-Jean Paul-Sartre'
'>How *utterly fucked in the head* do you have to be to want to destroy the constitution (even foreigners get due process here) **and** want to torture children just to "own the libs?" It\'s disgusting.\n\nThey have nothing else. All their go-to talking points (pro-life, anti-LGBTQIA anything, small government, gun rights) are shown to have awful consequences for people that aren\'t them. \n'
'I just tried to reason with a redhat (i know, mistake) and then he spewed at me that 5/6 people who come here are rapists/coyotes/ms-13 and that ALL the men were guaranteed to be all 3, also calling the child internment "daycares", had to stop and walk away because there was going to be no convincing to be had, then get some cultist saying i was schooled, probably because hit a faux news nerve (can read my comment history), painted me as a blind "librul" who only watches "fake news", irony is im a huge freespeechtv supporter. Nothing will convince these people cause they dont care and dont want to care'
"Ugh, yep. I feel for you there. I get along with my parents really well so long as the subject stays in life or hobbies or memories, but sooner or later the radio goes on or the computer comes out, and then it's nothing but outrage over wild, easily disproven lies they don't seem to have any defenses against.\n\nI remember one day when I was in town my dad had clicked himself off Drudge into god knows what and was going on about how Obama had sold Yellowstone to China. As usual I called him on it and insisted you can't just make wild claims like that without proof from reputable sources, and he dropped it, but immediately stumbled into more fake shit.\n\nIt's so disheartening to see someone whom I always regarded as very intelligent (and whom I still think is in many areas) so helpless and acting so immaturely. No checking sources, no quality independent research, no attempt to frame the issue from the opposing side to see if a position holds up to scrutiny, no bullshit radar.\n\nI love them anyway, but damn."
"Sounds like my parents, but amplified and with the roles reversed. My dad died in 2003, however. I have zero doubt in my mind that he would be a Trump cultist right now, had he survived.\n\nYour mom sounds toxic. You should consider not subjecting yourself to that.  You don't have to, after all."
'No presidential candidate in American history has ever colluded with a foreign enemy to subvert our own democratic elections.'

'Facts are not so much kryptonite to them, as many supposed; they’re chess pieces on the game board of our team. They simply choose to knock their “truth” pieces off and use whatever else they can find around the room instead - all the while saying that the as-agreed-to rules at the outset of the game are not the rules at all.\n\nIOW - it’s no different than arguing with infants.'
'Peculiar, no. It is infuriating, gross and unfathomable how so many people can be so blind.'
"It's hypocritical, isn't it? We are getting tired of Toxic Trump"
"Trump and the Republicans, creating today's terrorist, and now, by traumatizing kids, tomorrow's terrorist, today.\n \nPSA:  Trump and the Republicans are what you get when you don't vote.\n \n**Make sure you are registered, because the Republicans have been deregistering people all over the place, and**\n \n##VOTE##\n\n**Because nobody in America should be considered too poor to live.**\n\n**Pass it on.**"
'I mean, we all saw the way the committee treated Agent Strzok. They literally went on the aggressive as soon as they got a chance to, every single one of those old fucks. Republicans are not the party they claim to be but I have been able to dupe idiots into believing they are patriots. Crooks.'
"Manipulating people's fears and exaggerating their beliefs, essentially turning them to extremists, or y'allqueada, can't be down played how you're trying to do it. Especially not with a party as hippocritical and weak minded as Republicans, those ads worked on them, not on Democrats. The hacking to expose corruption you mention has led to exactly 0 indictments and has been dismissed by everyone but the feeble minded Republicans who, I repeat, are hippocritical to their core. You can't take people who blindly follow a leader who represents everything they claim to be against seriously. "
"Repeating this bullshit doesn't make it true"
'Obama did what he did with the best intentions suited to what he judged to be the gravity of the situation at the time while being advised by the intelligence community.\n\nTrump takes his advice from the Russian plotters in spite of what the intelligence community advises.\n\nIt’s what should be done now that matters. Trump is blaming other people for not knowing how serious his crimes were or how serious they were but ignoring his current contradictory and treasonous actions. \n\n-edited some typo-voodoo '
'Because most people know the facts. The results of the election were not affected, even Obama says this. Its not the Republicans fault that Hillary Clinton used an insecure email server. Russian and Chinese actors have been trying to hack our stuff for 20 years. But Rosenstien also failed to mention that the Republican assets were attacked also. There is not as much there there as what the leftist media is claiming. Which is usually the way it turns.'
'Damn right, fuck her.'
"Yes, because she was working for Putin to split the vote on the left, thus weakening Hillary. First keep in mind that Stein has been seen eating dinner with, among others, Flynn and Putin himself.\n\nSecond, Jill Stein stayed in race much longer than would make sense if she were actually running legitimately. She has extensive ties to Russia and has been given a disproportionate amount of screen time on RT the English language Russian propaganda channel.\n\nAnd then there are the places she campaigned. She basically campaigned in areas she had a snow balls chance in hell. It doesn't make sense unless her motivation was weakening Hillary turns out that's EXACTLY the right places to hurt Hillary.\n\nWho would have thought.\n\nStein works for the Russian gov't. Plain and simple."
"The physical voting apparatus was not compromised, that has nothing to do with what we're discussing.\n\nDig your head out of your ass.  You're being lied to and you're loving it because the liar has a red hat."
'I wouldn’t waste your time with them. Everyone they dislike is a Russian troll. '
'My kid just got a subscription to MAD magazine triggered by this. '
"This is funny, but I think with Rosenstein's resignation this investigation is in danger and may end very soon. \n\n[For Impeachment Referral, Mueller Would Need Rosenstein](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/for-impeachment-referral-mueller-would-need-rosenstein)"
'Will you actually respond to him if the memo is a failure and the bullshit most people think it is? '
'Oh? Tell me what could be in that memo that makes trump anything but a national embarrassment that is dangerously destabilizing the world. '
"This comment hasn't aged very well, and it has only been 4 days. What mental gymnastics will this sub pull now to excuse their hate for Trump?"
'What exactly do you think you’re gloating about? You people got a memo released that did nothing to hinder the investigation. We might just get another indictment. Also, Trump is a dumb cunt, that’s why we (and might I add, a lot more than half of your fellow countrymen) hate him. I’ve already stated what’s wrong with him, though I’d imagine it’s hard to see that while his cock is shoved all the way into your throat. '
'If I’m retarded, that makes you something even less flattering. Tell me, what is so obvious that I’m missing, or, as usual for your lot, do you only have  weak ad hominem?'
">You people got a memo released that did nothing to hinder the investigation.\n\nWhat?! The whole investigation and Russia story was shown to be manufactured from the very beginning by the DNC. What the hell. Do you seriously think it's okay having the FBI colluding with a political party to spy and gather dirt on another candidate? \n\nLook, I get that you might not like Trump because of his attitude and/or some things he might have said or done and I respect that, but you cannot seriously defend the collusion and corruption of the DNC. This whole thing makes Watergate look like child's play."
"No no this ones about the FBI staging a coup with Hilary and they found a memo about it or something. It's all bullshit. I know there's plenty of bullshit produced by both sides to attack the others, but republicans always create the most outlandish bullshit because their base gobbles it up. It's because they are so desperate to be right that they don't even think to check facts after Fox News hypes them up."
'I don’t trust just about any media source, and nice job trying to look into my history to make up some more ad hominem, really solidifies your position on the high ground there. Trump is a narcissistic moron that has no place in our political system. I don’t think the whole Russia thing is entirely true, mostly because the man is so damn incompetent that it’s not feasible for him to collude. I do think, however, that in his ego, he has done everything he can to impede the investigation. \n\nBut then we get to his supporters; you aren’t a bunch of docile safe border activists. You’re the most insufferable group of ignorant asshats to disgrace this planet’s surface. To you, everyone who disagrees with you is simultaneously an evil degenerate and a complete moron, you accuse everyone else of being in a safe space while you plug your ears and retreat to T_D to complain about how everyone else is so mean to the dear leader. You people literally cannot comprehend a perspective different than your own and use that as your own personal proof of how you’re right, because nothing else makes sense to you. You fucking go out of your way to shit on everyone that doesn’t agree with you. You are complacent in the further degradation of this country and our political system because for some reason you think you’re winning. Even as we get even more oligarchic, even as our allies talk behind our back, even as your genius of a leader TAUNTS a megalomaniac with a goddamn nuclear missile. '
"So trying to stop a phony investigation, which the sole purpose is to undermine his name and actions, makes him the bad guy? Well shit. Time will show the truth. Trump will be vindicated as he has been numerous times before. I'll tell you again, he's not the enemy."
">nice job trying to look into my history to make up some more ad hominem, really solidifies your position on the high ground there.\n\nWut?\n\n\n> You’re the most insufferable group of ignorant asshats to disgrace this planet’s surface. To you, everyone who disagrees with you is simultaneously an evil degenerate and a complete moron,\n\nNot really. That's just what you think. Also you're kind of proving my point with this rambling. Making me question your sanity.\n\n> you accuse everyone else of being in a safe space while you plug your ears and retreat to T_D to complain about how everyone else is so mean to the dear leader.\n\nMy sides. There has been dozens of anti-trump subreddits created this last year all of them meant to circlejerk and bash against Trump but god forbid there be one pro-Trump sub.\n\n>You people literally cannot comprehend a perspective different than your own and use that as your own personal proof of how you’re right, because nothing else makes sense to you.\n\nThat's some mighty projection. The same way you can't accept conservative views? Again, not helping your argument at all.\n\n>You fucking go out of your way to shit on everyone that doesn’t agree with you.\n\nWhat?! THIS IS LITERALLY WHAT ANTI-TRUMPERS AND LEFTISTS DO! You absolute fucking retard.\n\n>You are complacent in the further degradation of this country and our political system because for some reason you think you’re winning.\n\nYeah, now I know for sure you're an absolute idiot.\n\n>Even as we get even more oligarchic, even as our allies talk behind our back, even as your genius of a leader TAUNTS a megalomaniac with a goddamn nuclear missile. \n\nOligarchy?! Do you even know the meaning of the words you use? The very existence of the constitution prohibits an oligarchic regime from existing in the US. \n\n>even as our allies talk behind our back,\n\nAnd you'd know that how? Are you a spy or are you just dramatizing the situation? Also, like allies don't plot and talk behind each others back, welcome to the real world.\n\n>even as your genius of a leader TAUNTS a megalomaniac with a goddamn nuclear missile. \n\nSo much so that South Korea officials have admitted Trump has been of great help in establishing more conversation between the two Koreas. If you for one single second believe Kim Jong Un would DARE fire a nuclear missile into South Korea or the US then you'd have to be out of your damned mind. It would be literal suicide for their entire nation and himself. It's all NK propaganda to bolster his popularity and credibility.\n\n\n\nBut all in all thank you. You really helped me prove my point. That angry salty rant of yours only solidifies what I said about you. One useful idiot that has no idea how the real world works."

'I do not want to get into the details, but a side of my family is descended by people who have actually been executed for treason. The circumstances surrounding that shitshow were alot more hazy and minor compared to raging shitstorm going on right now. Boggles the mind '
"For good reason, I think. Execution is, in many ways, pretty barbaric.  I don't think an eye for an eye is ever the right choice - and I'm much more in favor of rehabilitation than the death penalty, but I think treason being one of the greatest crimes a person can commit, should be punished by death.  I think it's hard not to argue what Trump has allegedly done is treasonous. "
"Mueller's team is mopping the floor with these two-bit crooks, but not even the dream team can force a judge to take white-collar sentencing seriously.  What's all this truly for if they're indicted for felonies, eviscerated in court, but only get parole?"
'Anyone else been watching holocaust/Nazi documentaries and finding scary parallels, with almost identical-sounding rhetoric? Frightening.\nI\'m mostly worried the Trumpian base\'s excuse of "Well it\'s the parent\'s fault" excuses the admin to do WHATEVER they want with these people..mistreat them torture them, kill them...We\'re already seeing egregious human rights abuses. You don\'t think Trumpers love this? Head on over to r/AskTrumpsupporters, where every single response to this question is in favor of the policy. If American\'s don\'t wanna boycott every financial institution, organization and corporation that plays even a slight part in this, then they are complicit. Because Fuck you, Americans.\n\n--Sincerely, a really, super pissed-off Canadian.'
'Just like the Russia investigation. Trump fired James Comey, said he did it to stop the Russia investigation, ordered the firing of Mueller, and now says he has the right to pardon himself. He causes his own problems. His own Twitter feed is incriminating.'
'Crisis actors!'
"Not yet, but they didn't even imply people were being tortured and killed, just that this rhetoric and behavior could easily lead there."
"I've never made my way to that circle of hell, I'd just always assumed if you really hated liberal people  you'd spell it right lol"
"You think Pence will stop this shit?  He's itching to continue everything Trump is doing but make it religious.  We'd jump out of the fascist frying pan and into the Theocratic fire."
"That's because this sub often got brigaded by our crazy older sister sub via concern and both sides trolling. For example, there was a shitposting of Trump made it to the first image search of idiot that made it to the same page. No one questioned why it fit to our sub's purpose. The next time someone shitpost that Trump made it to the first image search of moron suddenly everyone 'concerned' for why that post made it to political sub and declared this sub went downhill.\n\nBut yeah, i know one of the guy that got upvoted constantly by me that got downvoted hard occasionally, and i think some crazy liberal community that got duped by Taylor  Mensch brigaded this sub sometimes too."

'If he does actually end up answering questions in some capacity, I honestly can’t foresee a scenario where he doesn’t lie about something. Trump and people of his ilk are *compelled* to lie because they’ve spent their entire lives lying, in both minor and major ways, to maintain their high-level status. Dad wants to know where that $60,000 went? Better not tell him I blew it on hookers. Business failing? Better make up some shit to get the bank to still give you that loan. \n\nTrump can’t not lie. The stakes are the highest they’ve ever been in his entire life and, god only knows what kind of shit this guy has done to get where he is today. Conventionally unattractive, objectively uneducated, profoundly shallow - he has had to compensate for this stuff his entire life. No way he did all that by being an honest person. '

'Why are all authoritarians basically cartoon-levels of evil and stereotype? '
"Dont be so sure. I hate Trump more than most but if you think he's somehow just going to roll over and let this happen you are most likely mistaken. I think this subreddit constantly underappreciates the power that trump wields. If the election were held again today he would 100% still win. His supporters just don't care what he has done (illegal or not). He is the head of a cult of personality. I think we had better prepare for the worst and start planning how to defeat him in 2020. Endless circlejerking doesn't help the situation one bit. "

If I was a troll I’d have some garbage line about Hillary and uranium, or fusion, or whatever shit they’re shilling now. \n\nImo if there was any chance of impeaching trump it should have occurred dozens of times already. The fact that every crime he’s committed since being in office has been ignored is where I’m basing my skepticism.

"I can't imagine that Trump doesn't immediately pardon Kush or Jr. We need to be ready to scream bloody murder when he does. "
'I gotta imagine Kushner would flip on Donny in seconds, if he hasn’t already. Wouldn’t you do everything in your power to put the guy who rapes your fiancé behind bars?'
'This works the other way too, though.  For a lot of these guys, just 5-10 years is pretty much a death sentence. When you are in your golden years and people are mentioning your name on Reddit, would you rather the responses be "I can\'t believe that old bastard got off with probation!" or "Could we please stop with the prison rape jokes?" '
"Not exactly true - Mueller can bring charges and prosecute up to until the executive level.  That leaves him plenty of space to tear the house down.  When Trump's son, campaign manager, national security advisor, etc. are all convicted, it will be hard to stand any longer."
'A motherfucking criminal conspiracy '
'Do you know what happened to Nixon? Only after the pawns had fallen did he admit defeat and resign before the inevitable - impeachment proceedings'
"Here's the thing: Even if Trump were indicted and arrested, he wouldn't lose any of his presidential powers unless he was impeached by the House and removed from office by the Senate. The Constitution simply doesn't allow for presidential powers to be stripped any other way (edit: also with the 25th Amendment, see below). Conceivably, Trump could be convicted in criminal court and sentenced to prison for the rest of his life and still have the power to launch an unprovoked nuclear strike."

'While this may seem absurd to the point of hilarity (because, in truth, it really is), I am worried they are making a fuss about this memo as groundwork to fire Rosenstein and install a Trump stooge as the one with oversight of the investigation. That person could then try to stymie the investigation by trying to narrow the scope, smother it financially, leak to the White House anything he/she knows, and ultimately decide the investigation is no longer worth having. \n\nRosenstein might be the only current stop-gap keeping Mueller and his team in place and functional. Even if Mueller and company aren’t fired, there are ways another DAG could stifle their work. \n\nAlso, can someone please tell me why no one is looking at Nunes for obstruction? This guy is acting like Donnie and his administration have a pee tape on him. '

"Not exactly. The R's are seeking the release of a memo that, presumably, criminally implicates the D's, the DOJ and the previous administration. If the D's had their own memo that criminally implicates the R's I would say the same principle applies. However, that's not what is happening. The D's are seeking to release a memo that seeks to discredit the Nunes memo as fictitious. Which raises the question: If what's in the Nunes memo is fake and false, why do the Ds feel the need to block it? Moreover, why do the Ds want to release their own memo first to preface what's in the Nunes memo if what's discovered will ultimately be found to be false? Why not call the R's bluff, let it be released and let the chips fall where they may? Why the panicked response? It would seem the only reason the D's would fight against this as hard as they are is because what's in the Nunes memo is incredibly damning. "

'Captain Picard would disagree. He’s probably guilty of a wide and deep ocean of bullshit, but this is not the reason.'
"Totally. An investigation could potentially be very grueling and burdensome, especially in the case where it's conducted by someone who is aggressively trying to take you down with literally anything they can or by almost any means possible. It could even go as far as to almost be harassing. At some point all of it is going to become stressful and actually take away from your normal everyday life and even being able to do your job.\n\nFor example, look at how fervently some people were trying to attack Obama over his birth certificate. Not a perfect example as it was never n investigation, but more to highlight how ridiculous and borderline harassing some people can be just to try to hurt someone else. No doubt Obama for tired if that shit.\n\nFor example, Bill Clinton and the whole Lewinsky thing. The whole background and motivations for the whole situation are much now complex but what it ended up boiling down to at the face of it was that Republicans tried to back Bill into a corner and impeach him for lying about having sex with someone. Like, who the fuck cares? But these people were so crazy to try to pin him with anything to try to get out of office that they resorted to that. That's some pretty shitty tactics.\n\nSo simply expressing distaste or contempt for an investigation doesn't necessitate guilt. It might just mean that those accusers/investigators are assholes."

"The exact line of witch hunt is pretty bad though. It implies that he doesn't trust the DOJ and doesn't want other people to trust it either. He isn't just denying claims that he may be guilty, he's trying to de-legitimize the organization investigating him without giving a good reason. "

"You're completely wrong (one time when you'll be happy to hear that).\n\nThis investigation has been going on for 1.5 years - 7 months of that time with Robert Mueller leading the way. Mueller flipped General Flynn, who was below only Trump and Pence in importance. Remember: General Flynn violated the Logan Act, violated FARA (was working for the Turkish government at the time he was working for the US and didn't register as a foreign agent), and was also conspiring to lead a clandestine operation wherein he would kidnap and extradite an American resident (a Turkish 'opposition' leader who lives in Pennsylvania) to Turkey in exchange for money...and he was only charged with lying to the FBI. That's not a coincidence or oversight; he sang the sweetest tune to Mueller and the only people Mueller would've wanted info on would've been Trump and Pence. In a criminal case you *always* pin the most crimes on the guy who's highest on the food chain.\n\nIndeed, Trump will not go away quietly. Once it's evident he's completely cornered with no way out (we're likely 6-12 months from there) he'll go [Hitler-In-The-Bunker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7PmzdINGZk) and fire acting Attorneys General until he can get someone who fires Mueller...or he'll take actions that'll require the courts to slap him back down to reality. But back down to reality he'll go, and either in jail or exile he'll end up."
"Yes two indictments with one of them pleading guilty is nothing. This thing isn't just about collusion. If there is anyone in office that has committed any kind of crime then they need to go - or was drain the swamp just another Trump campaign lie? I don't understand what an FBI investigation has to do with a hate mob. Everyone is going to get their due process this isn't some backwater county pulling drug busts and railroading people just to look busy and keep the funds flowing. The scrutiny that these cases will have to endure is unheard of. If there is so much as an uncrossed t in a warrant somewhere you can bet we will hear about it. There is no downside to this, bring all of the money laundering, bribe taking, self dealing, lying pieces of shit that are working at the highest federal levels and bury them in their own crimes. As I said this is the only swamp draining that is going to happen in Washington. "
'I agree. The FBI shouldn’t be immune from criticism however the way Nunez and the other Republicans are going about this is wrong. They are waging a public war on the agency instead of going through the appropriate committees. They are attempting to publicly discredit the agency and its leadership in an effort to undermine the Trump-Russia collusion investigation. '

'**Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act**\n\nThe Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, commonly referred to as the RICO Act or simply RICO, is a United States federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization. The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering, and it allows the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes which they ordered others to do or assisted them in doing, closing a perceived loophole that allowed a person who instructed someone else to, for example, murder, to be exempt from the trial because they did not actually commit the crime personally.\n\nRICO was enacted by section 901(a) of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 (Pub.L. 91–452, 84 Stat. 922, enacted October 15, 1970), and is codified at 18 U.S.C. ch.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

Around that time, the Russians re-assessed the profile of the kind of people they look for in espionage against the US. By that time, communism had a very bad reputation, and there weren't any prominent communist idealists in the US to exploit by Russia. Instead, Russia decided that people who had low morals, cheated on their wives, were narcissistic with grandiose ideas, who had problems with money would be the ideal targets to turn against the United States."

Don't gimme that concern trolling about dividing the country. Trump is a criminal and he will be held accountable for his crimes."
"Minus 19 indictments, 5 guilty pleas, and the fact that it's incredibly obvious besides all that. I mean let's think back to when he fired Comey, what did he do immediately following that? I'm paraphrasing, but he said that immense pressure had been taken off of his shoulders, and later bragged about it on national television. \n\nIf you're here on Reddit and you don't see how obvious it is that he's guilty of all that and more, then you are either a troll or you have your head in the sand. "
"Over 19 indictments under a year at a 1/10th the cost of trumps golf trips. Comparatively this investigation has far more results, much quicker and cheaper (magnitudes cheaper) than that stupid ass email investigation into Hilary Clinton.\n\nI'd much rather pay to preserve democracy than float a dictators golfs trips for 10x as much. Fucking obviously.\n\nFinally an investigation with results and the hyper partisan fucks are crying foul, surprising literally no one."
"You couldn't be more wrong.  Trump's golf trips have cost WAY more than this investigation.  Melania living in NYC for the first year cost more than this investigation.  \n\nAnd they have more than nothing, Flynn, Manafort, & Gates have all plead guilty just to name a few.  \n\nThis investigation did not divide this country, Trump's racist views has divided the country.  He gave a legitimacy to people whose views are backwards and wrong.  When he said good people on both sides about Charlottesville, he welcomed racists and bigots.  He, his rhetoric, and his supporters (you) have done more damage to this country than whatever perceived damage Mueller has done. \n\nThe rest of the world thinks we're stupid for electing him, we fucked up bad.

It would take a super majority to impeach anyways. So what is there to be afraid of?"
"Didn't he lead some sort of stupid war on ferret's when he was mayor?"
'Ok but you completely glossed over the main part of my comment. They have had multiple people plead guilty and have a good amount of evidence on others that have not plead yet.

'**Terrorism in the United States**\n\nIn the United States a common definition of terrorism is the systematic or threatened use of violence in order to intimidate a population or government and thereby effect political, religious, or ideological change. This article serves as a list and compilation of acts of terrorism, attempts of terrorism, and other such items pertaining to terrorist activities within the domestic borders of the United States by non-state actors or spies acting in the interests of or persons acting without approval of state actors.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'
'Yup. When the bots and trolls are on the warpath, it\'s like when the animals in a forest lose their shit before an earthquake or run for their lives ahead of a wildfire - batten down the hatches mateys, thar be a *shitstorm* abrewin\'. \n\nAnd you can often tell exactly what kind of bombshell is incoming, if you pay a little attention. Like you said, when they lose their shit over a seemingly minor story - or when they chatter about a specific person (and not one of the usual suspects like Hillary / Comey / Podesta / etc) out of nowhere, or when a whole bunch of similar stories appear with only the name of the person involved changed. \n\nFor example, a while back there was suddenly a bunch of chaff about Comey / Podesta / Debbie Schultz Wasserman (?) / Oprah / Hillary / whoever getting arrested in a predawn raid. Fast forward a little while later, and it turns out *Manafort* was the one getting a rude awakening. \n\nOf course, it\'s not a hard and fast rule, for example when the Papadopoulos thing broke everyone went "who?", but it works on a general principle.\n\n(See Russia? We can do the pattern analysis stuff too!)'
'\n\n\nSpecial counsel Robert S. Mueller III has added a veteran cyber prosecutor to his team, filling what has long been a gap in expertise and potentially signaling a recent focus on computer crimes.\n\nRyan K. Dickey was assigned to Mueller’s team in early November from the Justice Department’s computer crime and intellectual-property section, said a spokesman for the special counsel’s office. He joined 16 other lawyers who are highly respected by their peers but who have come under fire from Republicans wary of some of their political contributions to Democrats.\n\nDickey’s addition is particularly notable because he is the first publicly known member of the team specializing solely in cyber issues. The others’ expertise is mainly in a variety of white-collar crimes, including fraud, money laundering and public corruption, though Mueller also has appellate specialists and one of the government’s foremost experts in criminal law.\n\nZainab Ahmad and Brandon Van Grack have handled some cybercrime issues in the past, though they are recognized more for their work on terrorism and national security.\n\nMueller was appointed in May to investigate any possible links or coordination between the Russian government and the Trump campaign to influence the 2016 election, and any matters that might arise out of that work.\nHe has charged or negotiated plea deals with four former Trump campaign or administration officials, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign manager Paul Manafort, though Manafort’s charges have nothing to do with his work for Trump.\n\nFlynn and another former campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, are now cooperating with the Mueller team. Mueller recently indicated to Trump’s legal team that his office is likely to seek an interview with the president, though Trump offered ambiguous comments Wednesday as to whether he would be willing to do that, saying, “It seems unlikely you’d even have an interview.”\n\nMueller’s work has long had an important cybersecurity component — central to the probe is Russia’s hacking of Democrats’ emails in an effort to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system and help Trump win. The original FBI counterintelligence probe was launched in part because a Trump campaign adviser was said to have told an Australian diplomat that Russia had emails that could embarrass Democrats, and in July 2016, private Democratic messages thought to have been hacked by Russia began appearing online.\n\nMueller also is in possession of information from Facebook about politically themed advertisements bought through Russian accounts. \n\nLegal analysts have said that one charge Mueller might pursue would be a conspiracy to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, if he can demonstrate that members of Trump’s team conspired in Russia’s hacking effort to influence the election.\n\nSome in the legal world had wondered why Mueller had not previously tapped a cyber prosecutor to join his team.\n\nTrump has long denied any wrongdoing and has decried the probe as a “witch hunt.” He tweeted Wednesday: “The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues. There was no collusion, everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion, & yet on and on it goes. Russia & the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. Republicans should finally take control!”\n\nDickey, who previously worked as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, has participated in a number of high-profile computer-crime prosecutions — including the ongoing case against the file-sharing site Megaupload and the investigation of the Romanian hacker known as “Guccifer.”\n\nGuccifer, whose real name is Marcel Lehel Lazar, penetrated email, Facebook and other online accounts of celebrities and political figures, including former secretary of state Colin Powell, former Bill Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal and a family member of George W. Bush. His hacking inadvertently revealed that Hillary Clinton was using a private email account when she was secretary of state.\n\nSomeone using the moniker Guccifer 2.0 in June 2016 claimed credit for hacking the Democratic National Committee’s network, though the intelligence community later assessed that the Russian spy agency GRU had used the persona and two websites to release data hacked from the Democrats. Lazar had long been in custody by that time; he was sentenced in September 2016 to four years and four months in U.S. prison.\n'
"I've seen it be done over and over. I respect your intentions but I still wanted to give people a heads up. Trump is so dumb that he comes over as comical at the same time he's poisoning America and stripping decency by catering to whomever praises him. Trump allows scum to come out behind rocks and demonstrate their stupidity. Racism is simply stupidity. Assange can wait. Trump needs to be destroyed along with his band of merry men. Trump's about racism. So along with his utter stupidity we need to shout out our objection to him. And we're not even halfway there. \n"

Russia as an entity isn\'t inherently evil (unless you\'re involved in the evil) and progressives try to keep an open mind.

"Because treason has a very specific meaning and people who use it come off seeming that they don't know the law and are embellishing the crimes the president is accused of.

Once American streets become Fallujah for the US military, everyone that doesn't wear military camo and proper insignia or markings with weapons in their hands are going to be treated the same as Iraqi insurgents and ISIS.\n\nWe won't have a Second Amendment after this, I don't think."
"No. Referring to cutting off Japan's oil as essentially already being at war would be legit. This would be more like if cutting off most of the oil, but leaving just enough so that they weren't quite motivated to bomb Pearl Harbor. "
"What's your take on it?  I've fought in a war against the unruly and the insurgent.  We just use Hellfires instead of rope nowadays to demoralize a population through executing their leadership.  Because we can always say we didn't specifically target Americans, since Hellfires tend to kill everything in that area over there, so happy little accidents."
"Number one, we aren't Iraq and there isn't going to be a superpower that comes in and over throws our government and sends the country into chaos. Number two, people here live a life of comfort and the fact that people fetishize the civil war on Twitter or Facebook and talk about their guns doesn't mean they are actually going to do anything at all.  You're being ridiculous. "
"You're confusing being invaded with this civil war the Trumpers are threatening, that are already being checked by anti-Trumpers threatening to meet them on the streets, with some foreign invasion force.\n\nIt's not going to be an invasion.  It's going to be the US military being allowed to operate against Americans on US soil to put an end to the chaos if anti-Trumpers decide the Trumper's threats to wage war to protect their President means having to decide the future of America by destroying the opposition.\n\nI'd like to think we can be civil about this, and Mueller can bring this guy down.  But if he can't, or he's fired, then a combination of the recession coming in October time frame, the blame game for it, and the feeling that there is no justice after Mueller is out of power, may very well lead to violence.\n\nAt this point, if they DID fire Mueller, then that means we have no power to change things anymore against what we see as evil.  And that leaves us with no other recourse to change things quickly enough to save our future than to bring the system and anyone that supports it down, clean the slate, and rebuild it from scratch.\n\nThe people on the opposite side are seeing the same thing: we're the enemy of their America, and thus they may have to end us totally likewise."

Sanders supporters were protesting\xa0CNN\'s coverage of the\xa02016 United States presidential elections, specifically in regards to the lack of airtime Sanders has received. Known as Occupy CNN, protesters claimed that\xa0major media networks\xa0have intentionally blacked out Sanders\'\xa0presidential campaign\xa0in favor of giving much more airtime to candidates such as\xa0Hillary Clinton.\n\nDonna Brazile and Roland MartinEdit\n\nIn October 2016,\xa0WikiLeaks\xa0published\xa0emailsfrom\xa0John Podesta\xa0which showed CNN contributor\xa0Donna Brazile\xa0passing the questions for a CNN-sponsored debate to the Clinton campaign. In the email, Brazile discussed her concern of Clinton\'s ability to field a question regarding the death penalty. The following day Clinton would receive the question about the death penalty, verbatim from an audience member at the CNN-hosted Town Hall event.[14]\xa0According to a\xa0CNNMoney\xa0investigation, the debate moderator\xa0Roland Martin\xa0of\xa0TV One\xa0"did not deny sharing information with Brazile."CNN severed ties with Brazile on October 14, 2016.\n\nWikileaks emailsEdit\n\nCNN anchor\xa0Chris Cuomo\xa0said on a live coverage of the 2016 elections that downloading the\xa0Podesta emails\xa0from the\xa0Wikileaks\xa0website was illegal, and that only the media could legally do so. The statement drew criticism to the network for being false.\n\nTrump administration coverage\n\nOn January 10, 2017, CNN reported on the existence of classified documents that said Russia had compromising personal and financial information about then President-elect\xa0Donald Trump. CNN did not publish\xa0the dossier, or any specific details of the dossier. Later that day,\xa0BuzzFeed\xa0published the entire 35-page dossier with a disclaimer that it was unverified and "includes some clear errors".\xa0The dossier had been read widely by political and media figures in Washington, and had been sent to multiple other journalists who had declined to publish it as it was unsubstantiated.At a press conference the following day, Trump referred to CNN as\xa0fake news\xa0and refused to take a question from CNN reporter\xa0Jim Acosta.\n\n\n\nOn June 26, 2017, three network investigative journalists; Thomas Frank,\xa0Eric Lichtblau, and Lex Haris, resigned from CNN over a false story, later retracted, that connected\xa0Anthony Scaramucci\xa0to a $10 billion Russian investment fund. The network apologized to Scaramucci and stated that the online story did not meet their\xa0editorial standards.\n\nOn November 6, 2017, CNN ran a story entitled "Trump asks Japan to build cars in the U.S. It already does."\xa0The story included only a partial quote from President Trump stating that he would like Japan (more) to make cars in America. However, CNN originally omitted the remainder of his statement congratulating two Japanese automakers for investing more money in the US to build another factory. The Washington Post took notice and criticized the report.The Post called the headline "snarky," and told the network, and others, to stop "cherry-picking the quote." CNN later changed the quote and the headline, issuing the following correction: "The original version of this article and its headline did not make clear that President Trump had praised Japanese automakers for expanding existing U.S. facilities and for making new investments in the U.S. The article and headline have been updated."\xa0\n\nThe Washington Post again fact-checked a CNN report regarding Trump on December 8, 2017: CNN ran a story that claimed two sources told the network that the Trump campaign received an email that gave Trump and his son Don Jr early access to Wikileaks documents on September 4, 2016. CNN had not obtained the supposed September 4th email. The sender was "Michael J. Erickson", who CNN was not able to contact.\xa0The Washington Post, however, did obtain the email, which showed that the email was actually sent on the day after the hacked documents were released by WikiLeaks--September 14, 2016.\xa0CNN issued a correction their story.\n\nThe network also imposed new rules on Russia related stories being published to social, video, editorial, or MoneyStream without going through the chain of command within CNN.\n\n\nPersian Gulf War\n\nDuring the\xa0Persian Gulf War, CNN was criticized for excessively pushing\xa0human interest stories\xa0and avoiding depictions of violent images; the result of all this being an alleged "propagandistic" presentation of news.\xa0A report by\xa0Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting\xa0(FAIR) quotes an unnamed CNN reporter as describing "the \'sweet beautiful sight\' of bombers taking off from\xa0Saudi Arabia".\n\nCoverage of Iranian protests\n\nIn 2014, the network was criticized for an unusual absence of live coverage of a large set of protests that followed the\xa02014 elections in Iran.\n\nOperation TailwindEdit\n\nIn 1998, CNN, in partnership with sister\xa0Timemagazine, ran a report that\xa0Operation Tailwindin 1970 in Vietnam involved the use of\xa0Saringas to kill a group of\xa0defectors\xa0from the\xa0United States military.\xa0The Pentagon\xa0denied the story. Skeptics deemed it improbable that such an extraordinary and risky\xa0atrocity\xa0could have gone unnoticed at the height of the\xa0Vietnam War\'s unpopularity. CNN, after a two-week inquiry, issued a retraction. The story\'s producers were summarily fired, and one of them has been highly critical of CNN\'s handling of the story, saying that the network bowed to pressure from high-ranking officials to kill the story.\n\n\nJeff Zucker\n\nCNN was criticized for its coverage of the\xa0Boston Marathon bombings, after erroneously reporting that a "dark-skinned male" had been arrested in connection with the attack. In the aftermath of the broadcast,\xa0Jeff Zucker\xa0– who became president of CNN in 2013 – lauded the coverage, claiming that "CNN shined this week",\xa0and boasted ratings success that CNN achieved during the coverage, adding that "viewers respected the network\'s accountability when it admitted its mistakes". Jon Stewart criticized Zucker\'s comments after calling CNN\'s coverage of the\xa0Washington Navy Yard shooting\xa0"breathless wrongness", claiming that "The lesson they take from this is – it doesn\'t matter how much they betray our trust."\n\nFredricka Whitfield\n\nOn June 13, 2015, while discussing the\xa02015 attack on the Dallas police headquarters, host\xa0Fredricka Whitfield\xa0referred to the gunman, James Boulware, as "courageous and brave, if not crazy". The comment received immediate backlash and calls for her to apologize. The next day, Whitfield stated on air that she misspoke and in no way believed the gunman was courageous or brave. After the backlash continued, she issued another on-air apology on June 15, saying she terribly misused those words, now understood how offensive it was and was sincerely sorry.\n\nM.I.A. Interview\n\nIn June 2009, musician\xa0M.I.A.\xa0stated she did an hour-long interview with CNN condemning the mass bombing and\xa0Tamil\xa0civilian fatalities at the hands of Government forces in\xa0Sri Lanka\xa0in 16 weeks the same year, "and they cut it down to one minute and made it about my single\xa0Paper Planes. When I went to the\xa0Grammys, I saw the same reporter from CNN, and I was like, \'Why did you do that?\' And she said, \'Because you used the G-word.\'" "Genocide. I guess you\'re not allowed to say that on CNN"\n\nSteubenville High School rape case coverage\n\nCNN revealed the name of the 16-year-old victim on March 17 by broadcasting unedited footage of one of the convicted rapists\' post-conviction statements. This practice is against the\xa0Associated Pressguidelines for coverage.\n\nMilwaukee riots coverageEdit\n\nDuring the\xa02016 Milwaukee riots, CNN showed a clip of Sylville Smith\'s sister, Sherelle Smith, urging rioters: "Don\'t bring that violence here," and referred to her as calling for peace. The rest of her speech, which was not included in the broadcast, included the following: "Burning down shit ain\'t going to help nobody! Y\'all burning down shit we need in our community. Take that shit to the suburbs! Burn that shit down! We need our weave. I don\'t wear it, but we need it." After being called out for selective editing, a CNN reporter involved in the story tweeted that they had "shorthanded" the quote and posted a link to a corrected video on CNN\'s website, which began with the screen shot that read: "An earlier version of this story mischaracterized what the victim\'s sister was trying to convey. She was calling for peace in her community, urging the protesters to go elsewhere."\n\n\nSome controversy was created by the use of CNN on-air staff for fictionalized reports and broadcasts in the science-fiction movie\xa0Contact.\n\n\n\nIsrael–Gaza conflictEdit\n\nDuring the\xa02014 Gaza conflict, hundreds of protesters came to the\xa0Time Warner Center, where CNN\'s\xa0New York City\xa0production facilities and bureau are housed. Various people accused CNN of biased coverage during live interviews on the network.\n\nSemi-automatic weapons\n\nCNN apologized for a May 15, 2003, story in which CNN\'s\xa0John Zarella\xa0and\xa0Broward County, Florida\xa0Sheriff\xa0Ken Jennedemonstrated the rapid firing of\xa0fully automatic\xa0firearms while covering the federal\xa0Assault Weapons Ban, due to expire the following year. The Assault Weapons Ban was concerned solely with\xa0semi-automatic firearms, not fully automatic ones, which had already been restricted by the\xa0National Firearms Act\xa0of 1934, and the subsequent 1986\xa0Firearm Owners Protection Act.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'

"Up until this tweet in particular, a small, *very* small part of me thought that Trump was somewhat of a good guy. Like, behind closed doors, you know? \n\nThat's gone.

'Wow! That has got to be the most lucid description of insanity that I’ve heard in years. Two opinions with neither of them describing any version of reality that I can think of. The question is not whether or not Trump talked to the Russians. The question is how in debt is he to the Russians that they are able to influence his decisions.

Can\'t we have a moment to mourn the victims?"\n\n-----\n\n(Another shooting happens)\n\n"This happened because the FBI is investigating Trump"\n\nGTFO!\n\nIt\'s insensitive to look for solutions to this reoccurring problem but it\'s ok to push your political agenda?!\n\nAnd now on the Donald they\'ve got a picture of a young boy learning how to shoot a gun and a lot of other pro gun dumb shit.  This is ridiculous, they don\'t talk about guns at all until a shooting happens and then all of a sudden it\'s "look at this girl shooting a gun", "here\'s a store owner that has guns, guess who\'s shop didn\'t get hit in a riot?" Etc.\n\nIt\'s so fucked up, and it\'s like, how long til the next one?  Nothing will happen, the news cycle will move on to something else until the next massacre and we get to see *all of this shit* repeat itself.'

"Who knew that a career in plumbing prior to politics wouldn't help in running a criminal investigation. "
"Actually, yes it does.  The guilty pleas were related to lying to the FBI about the 2016 election.  The Russian indictments were related to the 2016 election.  It's only by some weird twisted logic that you guys try to claim victory for every prosecution that isn't directly targeting the president....when the investigation was never targeted at him to begin with.  But I'm arguing with a 3 month old account, so I don't expect this to translate well into troll or Russian."

And criticized the President for acting guilty as fucking sin.  Who rightfully sang praise in defense Robert Mueller when everyone else seemed to have turned on him.\n\nBut after seeing how he did his “finish it the hell up” bullshit for the cameras, I’ve lost all respect for him and the integrity I thought he had.  Now he’s just pandering, going against his previous intentions.  You have to wonder, what the fuck does he stand for then if he’s so inconsistent.  Going wherever the wind fucking blows.'

Not sure what his endgame is since he’s retiring soon(?). Maybe it’s to be a consultant on Fox News perhaps? Who the hell knows. '
'No  that is incorrect, he was  entrapped by a devious prosecutor asking the same question different ways multiple times and if you answer just one time differently it is perjury, that is why the President will never have a deposition with him.

"Yet you don't have a source and ask for me to search it for myself? That's your first problem. I have read 1984, I believe you haven't because you are so emotional about it.

It seems to me that the US is pretty divided right now.\n Also the idea that Trump is playing 4D Chess and purposefully bombed that Syrian airstrip because it was unimportant to the Syrians seems a little silly because  Trump proceeded to carry out missile strikes against Syria  3 more times.\nAlso, Trump has continued to enforce sanctions on Russia\nand the US announced that it would stay fighting against Syria "indefinitely". So "Trump is a Putin puppet" but under Trump The US is in permanent War with one of Russia\'s only allies in the middle East.\n\nI\'m no fan of Trump and I think his shady dealings with the Saudis, Israel and everyone else who put money in his pocket needs to be exposed, but it seems unlikely that he is a Russian spy for god\'s sake.'

">thinking critically\n\nYou're literally too dumb to argue with"
"How can you even remotely claim / believe that that's thinking critically? I mean, seriously? Is thinking that the earth is flat, thinking critically? Is thinking than mankind never went on the moon?\nThinking critically means doubting what is believed to be true by seeking for further explanation / evidence, and then finding new / asserting old conclusions. Not just babyscreaming bullshit without a shred of proof, all the while evidence is in place of the contrary, and never admit wrongdoing or consequence. If a schoolmate / colleague of yours were to call you a rapist ifo everybody, would that be thinking critically? And once proven wrong, would you not want him to admit it publicly? Would you be ok with him/her walking away clean, while your reputation has been stained?\nIf all this doesn't give you goosebumps, you are lying to yourself, because trump, his people, and their rhetoric do this stuff ALL THE TIME!"

The bar is rock bottom, and now people will accept anything he does so long as its not illegal. \n\nTrump isn't a middle finger to the establishment, he's proof we need politicians who can be held accountable for their actions and have something to lose if they do something dumb.

"Of course.  Just more 5D chess.  Some days the investigation's secretly working for Hillary Clinton.  Other days the investigation's secretly working to put her in prison.  For months, Trump and his supporters have attacked the legitimacy of the investigation.  Now that they can no longer pretend it's partisan, they have to pretend that Trump *secretly* loved it all along.  \n\nDespite the predictability of these childish tactics, it always remains disturbing watching adults concede to them."

'I know Trump can fire Mueller. What I don’t know is, why does he have such powers? All one has to do is wait to see where an investigation is going. If it’s unfavorable, just fire. Seems a little stupid '
'He won’t do this. I swear he puts shit like this out there so he can then yell “fake news” and of course his idiot base buys it hook line and sinker. '
'Question from a Brit here.  What if Trump creates a serious distraction at the same time... Such as..er... Declaring war on NK taking attention away from firing Mueller. How would that affect things?'
'It will simply not trigger a constitution crisis. The president is explicitly able to order the AG to fire the special counsel. A new one will be found if he fires Mueller.\n\nBut they won’t; Mueller is now a weapon for Trump because of the scandals that have cropped up during his tenure as investigator. Trump and the GOP would much rather have him be the one to present evidence of wrongdoing than someone else because they can attack the credibility of the investigation.'
"Only if President Bill Clinton don't get them 1st ! Btw, is the UN gun grabbing invasion fleet that magically was on its way at the beginning of Obamas 1st 4 still at sea ? ( poor devils)"
'The investigation still continues without Mueller. Trump is desperate, and firing Mueller won’t do anything but sink his own ship faster. It also isn’t something that can just happen overnight— Rosenstein is the only only who can fire Mueller, and he said last week that there is no cause to do so. The process is more complex than we realize. We have to remember that we are not living in The Apprentice. He can’t just call Mueller into his office and gesticulate with his tiny hands while he proclaims, “You’re fired.”'
'It’s scary that people weren’t already scared.\n\nThis is why we’ll never see true revolution. What is it going to take? \n\nIt turns out, there’s no actual limit to how cowardly we are or what they can get away with. '
'Trump can’t fire Mueller, though. Rod Rosenstein is the only person with that power, and he has said on the record that there is no cause to do so. This isn’t something that could just happen in the dead of night. Abramson is stirring the pot. '
"My hunch is it would not really change the political dynamic here at home. The left will call it out for the smokescreen it is and be outraged that he is risking American lives for a distraction. The Trumpistas will parrot Republican talking points and whine about unpatriotic liberals not supporting the president in wartime.\n\nAt this point, I don't know if it's possible to create a distraction that would change the dynamic and the division. If North Korea attacked us, people would still (with some justification) blame it on Trump. To really change the game there'd need to be something happening to us outside of anyone's control or influence. Giant meteor? \n\nAnother theory might be is it would make it more likely for Republicans to decide they're ready for President Pence. Trump clearly could not handle a high-stakes conflict like that, so they'd need to keep a tight leash on him (which despite Kelly's efforts hasn't been successful) or get him out of the way."

The actual and alleged donations didn’t take place within the timeframe that the purchase was being discussed or voted on. The one exception being a guy who hadn’t worked there in close to 10 years and no longer lived in Russia.

'Boohoo.  Fat idiot Trunp and his pathetic band of losers are under investigation for money laundering and conspiracy against the U.S. and I\'m so mad that I cry about funny things.  Why don\'t you call "mother" and ask how she feels about Trump?  "Disgusting" and "vile" were the words, I believe.  It didn\'t stop those  sycophantic hypocrites from living in One Observatory Circle, you\'ll note.     \nAgain, I explained my username\'s origin, but still you continue to attempt to use it to attempt to justify your weak position.  When you have nothing to argue, you resort to childish taunts.  I\'d expect nothing better from you and am certain that no one else in your life outside of here does, either.'
'He’s harmless if he’s neutered because of a blue house and senate (which is difficult but possible). And he doesn’t have the cult of personality that Trump possesses. He would be a lame duck because no one on the fence is voting for hard right fake Christian who is suspected of Russian dealings after the Original president is gone for the exact same thing. The only danger is if the house and senate is still red after 2018. '
'I agree that pence is more inherently evil and black-hearted, but trump is still more dangerous because while he\'s an empty-headed buffoon, he still thrives on the same harmful policies that people like pence promote. The same policies would still be pursued, but with trump, you have the incredibly unstable irrational "IM GONNA NUKE NORTH KOREA" outbursts and twitter tirades that make everyone hate America.\n\nHowever, I do fear that if pence is POTUS, the resistance movements will die down or seem more delegitimized/desperate. Because it\'s easy to yell at a literal clown like trump when he boorishly mocks celebs on twitter or brags about sexual assault. pence carries a strong, albeit phony, air of dignity as if he\'s some kind of saint that will bring a lot of people on the fence over to his side.'
'I think Trump is more inherently evil and black hearted IMO. Remember the central park 5, kids accused of rape, he put out this HUGE AD in the newspaper calling for them to be executed, DNA evidence proved them innocent. A normal person would say "shit, I\'m so fucking sorry what have I done". An evil asshole would say "well, OK but we are too weak on criminals still! I was trying to make a point! Even if it wasn\'t them this time we need to be less soft!" What did Trump say... um... well he wouldn\'t accept they were innocent and insisted they should be killed.\n\nDid I mention the central park 5 were KIDS one as young as 14? Oh and they are black... but you knew that.'
'trump is a racist prick motivated by his own self interests. He wants to inflate his ego, get people to like him, and never admit he was wrong. And xenophobes are easier to manipulate into liking you. While he has plenty of inherent xenophobic views, they are more of a compliment to his ego-driven actions, rather than the main fuel (like pence, et al.) It\'s that small difference between "I hate you" and "I don\'t give a fuck about you".\n\nSo that\'s why I say people like pence are more pure evil. They genuinely HATE those who are different and want them to suffer (e.g. gay conversion therapy). That\'s why you\'ve seen trump\'s stances flip flop over the years and how he can claim to be more pro-LGBTQ than Hillary. He\'s lying to fuel his own ego.\n\nBut don\'t get me wrong, trump is still genuinely a MASSIVE xenophobe, it\'s just he\'s an even BIGGER egomaniac.'

">Trump frequently makes false statements, and Sekulow and Dowd are concerned that talking to Mueller could expose him to charges of lying to investigators, the Times reported.\n\nYou know you're in a bad place when your argument is that your client lies too much."
"I can't believe there are people who actually believe Trump will speak with Mueller. No attorney in the world would let their client speak with the prosecutor- doing otherwise would be tantamount to malpractice or ineffective assistance of counsel. This is fake media drama to fill time until Mueller actually makes his move. If Trump gets subpoenaed, he'll plead the fifth (just like any reasonable defendant would, regardless of guilt) and that will be that. Democrats and the left will forget all of the times they defended the fifth as a vital safeguard for the criminally accused (which it is), and claim that pleading the fifth is an admission of guilt (it isn't).  Republicans will suddenly forget all the times they claimed only guilty people plead the fifth (because they're hypocritical trash)."
'> no one can ignore a subpoena without consequence\n\nThe problem here is that Trump is someone who is entirely willing to say "Or what?" \n\nSeriously - what happens if a "I don\'t give a fuck" President refuses stuff like a subpoena?  It *should* trigger rapid impeachment and removal, but with complicit, enabling, anti-Constitution and anti-rule-of-law Republicans in Congress, there may be no teeth with which to enforce laws on Trump.'
'A US Marshal will force him to go-operate. Sure they could stop a Marshal going into the White House using some convoluted interpretation of the law but once he leaves the grounds it’s fair game.\n\nEven disregarding all the shit that a president needs to do off White House grounds, Trump would NEVER be able to not hold rally’s and campaign events. He’d rather die.'
'I think Mueller will pick the low hanging fruit and amass enough evidence of RICO that Trump’s business organization will crumble and he will exit office as a disgraced carpet bagger. His sons (maybe daughter) on the other hand will pay for the sins of their father. '
"No one to hold him accountable? Are you unfamiliar with the balance of powers? The issue is they've investigated for a year and have no collusion. When your job is to find illegal activity and you haven't found it, this is what you resort to hoping for. "
"In literally any other case, there wouldn't be a huge group claiming that indictments, a guilty plea, and who knows what else Mueller is keeping secret is nothing.\n\nAnd sometimes you have to go for whatever charges you can get. Al Capone had to be federally charged for tax evasion since the local authorities were complicit; are you telling me he was innocent?"
'1) Will it? He put Gorsuch there. I don’t trust him to rule fairly.\n2) Even if he testifies and fucks up horribly and perjures himself (which we know he will) - shit, even if he admits to everything, Congress still has to do something about it and I don’t think they will. He has their pen. \n\nI’m not trying to be cynical and I hate that I am but I’ve seen nothing that makes me think anything other than he’s gonna get away with all of it. \n\nWill probably be re-elected too because we’re in the darkest timeline. '
'Whatever charges you can get? Is that how sad a year long investigation is? This is the most leaky administration ever and they still have no evidence. The left is so desperate to find something on Trump that this is all they can do now. Let\'s interview Trump and knowing his stupid antics for running his mouth, let\'s hope we can get something.\n\nYou do realize the investigation was for Russian collusion. We are so far beyond that now that the left has turned it into "we gotta find him guilty of something". That\'s what\'s wrong here. '
'> I still have faith that they would not allow our democracy to be completely destroyed because of partisan bullshit\n\nOh, you have FAITH, huh?  Let me know when you unbury your head from the sand.  Our \'democracy\' has already been subverted, and frankly it\'s the attitude of people like yourself who still have "faith" contrary to mounds of evidence otherwise, that have enabled the destruction of everything that matters.\n\nLiterally nothing can be done to a president who refuses to obey the law unless Congress impeaches him and removes him from office.  Without that *critical fucking step*, all the subpoenas and declarations by the SUPREME COURT (also controlled by fucking republicans) don\'t mean dick, shit, or piss to reality.  And as long as you\'re waiting for people who have demonstrated their complicity and devotion to fascism to step up and oppose it, then I know you\'re not a person I can count on to actually do any goddamned thing about this country falling. '
'I\'m not a lawyer, but my understanding is that law enforcement officers like US Marshals have authority over people within the US.  The issue is that there are a few specific exceptions.  There are limited circumstances under which foreign diplomats can be arrested (though there is not "infinite" diplomatic immunity.)  \n\nThe legal question is wether there is some sort of exception for the POTUS when he is refusing a lawful court order such as a properly issued subpoena to testify.\n\nKeep in mind that the Secret Service are just another federal law enforcement agency.  They aren\'t some magic Presidential guard.  They also do stuff like bust currency counterfeiters.  I would think that everyone would try to avoid having the President\'s USSS detail be the ones to arrest him and bring him in, but it\'s entirely possible that a judge could order it, and they would carry out a lawful court order.'
'Getting elected was the worst thing that could have ever happened to him.\n\nFor him.  I\'ve been saying this for a while.  How fucking vain.  You run for the highest office in the land, knowing, that you can\'t win it?\n\nWhy?  According to Wollf\'s book it was because he wanted to parlay it into some kind of media giant.  I only kind of see how you get from one point to the other.  I guess the thinking was he could capture an potential audience of tens of millions and then play the aggrieved victim of a "stolen" election on TV till the end of his days.  With his base eating it up and buying Chinese Trump merch.\n\nHow\'d that work out for you, Donald?  Now you\'re in a place you never wanted to be.  Even you have to know you\'re so far in over your head.  Most of the country finds you to be somewhere between an embarrassment and a vile criminal.\n\nThe end result will hopefully be a conviction.  But that\'s exceedingly had to do, no matter the evidence.  The next best result would be the never-ending deep thrust of shame and humiliation that almost anyone would feel when they were exposed, like he will be.  But this isn\'t almost anyone.  He\'ll never allow himself an honest reckoning, internally, of the how and why.'

In Wolff’s book, obtained by the Guardian ahead of publication from a bookseller in New England, he suggests White House hopes for a quick end to the Mueller investigation are gravely misplaced.\n\n“You realise where this is going,” he is quoted as saying. “This is all about money laundering. Mueller chose [senior prosecutor Andrew] Weissmann first and he is a money-laundering guy. Their path to fucking Trump goes right through Paul Manafort, Don Jr and Jared Kushner … It’s as plain as a hair on your face.”\n\nLast month it was reported that federal prosecutors had subpoenaed records from Deutsche Bank, the German financial institution that has lent hundreds of millions of dollars to the Kushner property empire. Bannon continues: “It goes through Deutsche Bank and all the Kushner shit. The Kushner shit is greasy. They’re going to go right through that. They’re going to roll those two guys up and say play me or trade me.”\n\nScorning apparent White House insouciance, Bannon reaches for a hurricane metaphor: “They’re sitting on a beach trying to stop a Category Five.”'

'Well, according [to this article](https://www.dailywritingtips.com/jail-vs-prison/) (which is specifically meant for writers) the two are interchangeable as a colloquialism only.  Meaning that if you don\'t know any better then, by all means, feel free to use it.\n\n>When the words are used in reference to actual places of legal confinement, there is a distinct difference between a jail and a prison.\n\n>In most US states, jails are short-term facilities operated by local authorities, whereas prisons are long-term facilities operated by the state or federal government.\n\n>When people are arrested for anything, from drunk driving to murder, they will be temporarily confined in a jail. For lack of more appropriate facilities, mentally ill people are often placed in jail.\n\nThe article ends with the following admonishment:\n\n>Most speakers will probably continue to use jail informally to mean “a place of incarceration.” ***Professional writers, on the other hand, may be expected to observe a distinction between jail and prison in formal contexts.*** ^(emphasis mine)\n\nPlease keep in mind that the jail/prison differentiation is specific to the US.  If you are in the UK then the meanings are slightly different and jail is spelt "gaol".'

Doesn't the 1) being approached mean Russian associates might have actually attempted other avenues of undermining our election and 2) show that Jr at least was interested in entertaining such a lead?

Those that fight them back get a pass because someone has to. Turning a blind eye perpetuates and let’s the hatred fester and unfortunately sometimes you have to put rabid dogs down.\n\nFrom my POV the GOP are a bunch of fucking morons because this is a recipe for a Democratic Super majority in house and senate that could last at least 2 Democratic Commander-in-Chiefs being voted in for the next 2 decades...That could also be just as bad because Democrats are just as bad at fucking up (look at Debbie Wasserman Schultz and how she screwed Sanders out of being the nominee) ....

'>Lifelong Conservative/Republican. \n\n>Criticized Trump from day one, was immediately branded a liberal and ostracized. \n\nSame here. You\'re not alone friend. I disliked both Clinton & Trump. I didn\'t feel right but I caved into voting for Hillary due to being the lesser of the 2 evils. When Trump won figured, "lets give him a chance." \n\nThen he started pouring in Goldman Sachs into his cabinet, then he starts selling weapons to Saudis that end up in the hands of terrorist. As soon as I mention these things to Trump supporters I\'m labeled as a liberal/leftist or an SJW cuck from family/friends. What the hell happened? All these people said they didn\'t want Hillary to win for these reasons but now that Trump does it than you turn a blind eye and dehumanize anybody who brings it up? If anybody is losing consitency in their political views its obviously them, not me. \n\nI\'m glad I saw your comment. It feels good to know there\'s other conservatives who aren\'t completely ignoring the warranted criticism of this admistration. Gives me hope during a time I feel like I\'m losing it. '

I can get pissed at the Trumpettes when they're railing against something important and current like immigration or gun control or basic human decency, but when they're just whining about an image that will outlive all of them, and that represents such a good era for America, I can't get that mad. In fact their cries made me smile, cause they can't and won't be able to do shit about it."
'A completely non-tech explanation I like to use is this.\n\nRight now, you pay your water bill, and you use your water for whatever you want. Washing dishes, showers, baths, using the sink to wash your hands, flushing your toilet, etc.\n\nNow... Imagine if your water utility company could individually charge you for the different uses of water in your home. By default, toilet flushing, showering and using a sink are included. Want to take Bath? Gotta pay extra. Want to use a dishwasher? Gotta pay extra. Want to water your grass? Gotta pay extra. Oh you want to heat up your water? Gotta pay extra for that... And you still have to pay for the energy required to heat your water. \n\nI think you get the idea. Right now, you pay for internet and you can access every and anything you want.\n\nWithout net neutrality, ISPs can chop up the internet into packages and limit your access. \n\nThis goes even further... For example, Comcast is more often than not the only option for a person\'s internet. Comcast owns MSNBC. Comcast could decide to block any news outlet completely that they deem a competitor to MSNBC (including local news)  they could either offer those news outlets for a fee, or block them completely. They could completely prevent you from seeing any MSNBC competitor websites, social media, etc. \n\nYou know on YouTube, every now and then you\'ll run into a "this video is not available in your country" message? Now imagine that when you try to access CNN and see a "this website is not available with Comcast internet" message. Scary right?\n\nThis is a dangerous road considering the lack of diversity in the ISP market. Nothing good will come with the removal of net neutrality.'

'how are they still not aware of this is beyond me. From the very beginning they have been saying that no votes were altered. It was done through manipulation of information, fake websites and "FAKE NEWS".  These fucking morons can\'t even be bothered to actually pay attention, but we are supposed to take them seriously? '
"There were reports of malfunctioning computers used for voter roll. These machines might have been hacked by Russia and the day of the election they mysteriously crashed, disabling the vote for hours.  And surprise! It happened in dem territory.\n\nYou do not need to change a vote if this vote couldn't be cast in the first place."
'I think the issue is they get hung up with the word “hacked”, for a long time we kept saying that they hacked the election. To them this is false, because it would only be hacking if they hacked to change the votes. They don’t consider the leaks part of the election. I’m sure they’d change their mind if trump had been the victim, but what-ifs don’t help.\n\nNow every time we say that Russia manipulated our election, IE through fake news and propaganda, they respond “no they didn’t, nothing was hacked”. It’s an argument about definitions, and if you use their definition they’re right. Since they know they can win using their definition they default to this argument when talking about Russian interference, even if it’s not what we’re talking about. '
'> Let me get this straight, you want us to care that they "interfered" even though ~~not a single vote was changed~~ there **isn\'t yet any evidence votes were changed**, so you can justify the WORST candidate in the history of US elections \n losing to ~~a guy you don\'t like~~ **the worst president in American history who is actively making our country weaker**?\n\nYep.

Look how rabidly yall downvoted me because of a differing opinion... do you even want this country to get better?'
"You're right, for the most part he has been kept in check. But the fact that this complete con man is still in office and does have supporters makes people like me not satisfied or comfortable until his dumb fuckin ass is out. Him publicly hinting at wanting to be a dictator  (as most of us already knew) and there not being COMPLETE 100 percent uproar from all sides, bothers me. "
'Also, from what I saw in other threads he apparently thought no one knew about it and tried to keep it under wraps, but the Kremlin was going to let people know so they leaked the story?

'I mean to be fair, there needs to be a clearer line made for this if you want them to rule otherwise. Though with that specific incidence you could argue that it wasn\'t of the owner\'s concern, as making a LGBT friendly cake doesn\'t effect you (other than arguably reputation as you could be associated with supporting something you don\'t because you made it), you can inflate a similar case to being someone ordering a cake from you to protest your business. Should you be required to make a cake that says "Bob\'s Bakery is overpriced and bad! Call them at 888-888-8888 and tell them they suck!"? Or should a gay baker be forced to make a "kill the gays!" cake? There has to be a line somewhere, especially as the baker didn\'t reject the client for being gay, but rather what they requested the cake to be.'
"Trump gutted the administrative board that handles punishments for federal employees who violate ethics so they can't reach a quorum so there's no real recourse unless what they do is criminal.\n\ntldr: nothing matters any more"

'Decades of Fox News happened. The Civil Rights Act happened.

Eight years of having a black man, a black Democrat at that, broke these people, and they were frothing at the mouth to get a chance to get back at him for the biggest crime of all in their eyes: Existing while not white. And then along comes Donald Trump, a living caricature of their utter contempt for anyone and everyone not like them, a base simpleton who can barely string a sentence together, and they loved it. These people, they will never not support their Don. Frankly, if an when Donald Trump gets removed from office, I see great strife occurring. These people may not be smart, they may not have many, if any, applicable life skills, but there are two things they have an abundance of. Guns, and ammunition. As a result, I would not be surprised if mass rioting occurs if and when Donnie gets removed from office.'

We don't all have to resort to whataboutism as a defense. "
"A woman just turned down selling plan b to a woman who wanted an abortion.  Will that excuse work if I object to old people being drug addicts?  Gluttony is a sin after all.  Pain is part of life, so why should I allow another to hide from the realities of life.  If I were a pharmacist, I could pass judgement on those I feel lacking.  See, it opens a door into denial of service.  You can't just make it a special christian law that works only to favor the religious over the regular joe.\n\nhttp://www.wifr.com/content/news/Walmart-Pharmacist-denies-a-local-woman-an-emergency-contraceptive-for-religious-beliefs--444760553.html\n\nI'm a lapsed catholic.  If I start judging you all for failures to adhere to bible law, I'd have very few customers, if I ran a business or offered a service.    If we're going back in time, where's the time machine?  We used deny service to black people, now it's gays, why not the religious too?  Attendance at church doesn't make you all saints and now maybe those sins will have a price-tag."
"It's an ethics violation, not a law that carries a criminal penalty. The story is shit is my point. You people are very slow. The story is intended to keep the deranged anti Trumpers pissed off. You have Democratic reps encouraging harassmentand violence against the opposition. And we're the fucking Nazis? Learn about the national socialist party of 1930's Germany. Now study Democratic platforms like gun confiscation, nationalized medicine, centralized government. See how they seized control of the media first?  See a commonality?"
"Once again, none of what you have said has to do with the customization of a product. It is already illegal to reject service most of these ways. A pharmacist is not an artist, so they have no argument here. Also, this is not a special Christian law, a gay person can refuse to make a cake of Jesus Christ because they think that the Christian community oppresses them and it would effect their reputation in the community. However, in neither case can they refuse to make a cake that is more generic, or that they previously have made. Also, notice I said there should be better legislation dictating what is and isn't acceptable, because currently there is a lot of interpretation. However, in the case of an artist, as is currently the enforced law, you have to be allowed some extra room, as you sign your name or have yourself tagged in your work, so it becomes an indirect reflection of you. "
'That is where you are not seeing the point, it isn\'t just a religion thing. As quoted in the supreme court case it is "religious and philosophical objections" in "forms of expression", so this is not just a religious matter, but a philosophical one as well, and only pertaining to forms of expression. ( https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-111_j4el.pdf ) Also it is objections to the work, not the person, which you are failing to notice. If I refuse to offer service to a gay man, that is illegal. If I refuse to do something I am philosophically against, regardless of who asks, that is legal. Your argument is that I should be able to make anyone who does wedding photography shoot my porn because it is their job to take pictures, or a wildlife painter should have to paint themselves sucking hitler\'s penis as a practicing jew, which if you think is how law should work is quite extreme and objectively wrong. However, if the porn star wanted their wedding photographed, or the nazi wanted a wildlife painting, then they would have to provide those services.'
"The baker passed judgement on the sin of marrying for gays based upon a religious ideology.  The supreme court didn't talk about philosophy, it said the man's religious rights were tread on.  \n\nNow you're changing the equation by going from saying creating something to refusal of service which is a denial of service based on a philosophical argument, but a few comments ago, you were agreeing with me that doctor or nurse or pharmacist can't refuse service as isn't customized, so which is it?  \n\nSee how blurry these lines are that even you can't keep it straight?    It's now legal to discriminate based upon vague religious and philosophical definitions?  Muddy waters you're all wading thru, but a huge difference between denying someone a cake and say a surgery or transfusion.  If someone dies because someone's sky-god said don't help that guy and we're tossing civility out the window.  \n\nNext time I see a man floating down the river, should I ask his philosophical beliefs before I call for help or should I help because it's the right to do?  Is it the right thing to do to help someone who only helps their own?  Maybe I let the guy drown. "
'I actually think it\'s quite interesting that they blame Obama for everything and then for Trump\'s first year the rallying cry was "look at the stock market". \n\nThe first year of any presidency these sorts of things mean next to nothing because policy changes happen slowly and there\'s still a lag between policy change and economic effects.'
'Putin has journalists, political opponents, and basically any citizen who threatens his power murdered or imprisoned. \n\nThis isn’t up for debate from a geopolitical perspective; it’s just the facts. Everyone who works in contact with Russia knows it. He doesn’t even need to be personally ordering these assassinations for his regime and thus himself to be culpable.\n\nThat’s what’s wrong with supporting Putin. Any leader of any nation has probably ordered the deaths of other human beings, but if you can’t maintain control without doing it to *your own* people who have committed no crimes...'
"semi trump guy here. Love the tax reform, border wall, hate how he wants to handle immigration and the denial of climate change. People need to stop talking about this stormy crap. He was a celebrity when he fucked her and what have we learned about old celebrities the past few months?Also he probably didn't even know he would be president and she's just using this situation to desperately try and maintain some relevance. If he wasn't potus would she really be doing this? There are actual issues and this pornstar thing is just one of those distract the media situations. "
'I hope this doesn\'t get her killed or something like that. With all the spies being killed by russians and Trump having a "close" relationship with Russians.. man, she\'s in a dangerous spot.\n'
'There is one thing I don\'t get in this whole saga: \n\nWhy did they bother to pay her off? \n\nShe was shopping the story right after the access Hollywood Tahoe came out and he was being accused of assault by 19 different women to which the denial was "they are so ugly I\'d never assault them". If this story came out them it wouldn\'t have gotten two minutes. Hell he would have said "see I can bang porno stars i don\'t need to groupe anyone, I didn\'t, but I could have, wink"\n\nI feel like if the story was true he wouldn\'t bother hiding it. '
"i'm suppose to feel bad for someone sleeping with a married man and being paid $130,000 to not talk about it? \n\ni mean, it's not like we don't believe her. we all believe her. idk what else would come from this if she just says she did it. we know she did it. what's the point of all of this?"
"this is where i draw the line. There's plenty of other shit to kick his ass over, she doesn't need money from me to expose his infidelity. \n\nGo fuck for the money, whore."
"What exactly do you want to hear? Everyone already knows Trump fucked her while married, you're gonna give her money for what purpose?"
"She's trying to finance a lawsuit that if won, would release her from the NDA. That's the court fees and such she's talking about. But also just in general, the penalty for breaking an NDA is you get sued and have to pay a shit ton of money, so breaking the NDA wouldn't be legal, you just probably wouldn't go to jail for it, you'd face a financial penalty instead. "
'The penalty for breaking an NDA is financial and being in court. Basically she is asking for money that Trump would demand to be paid as his part of the contract she broke.  '
"Knowing the story doesn't mean you know the details. For all we know, they could've had  an abussive relationship were he did whatever he wanted because he was rich. That, for a president, is very very bad. \n\nObviously I doubt it's that, she probably just has naked photos of him(wich is equally bad for a president, he will become a bigger joke than he is already)"
"Or like the rape claims in Trump's divorce you mean?\nOr the 17 others?\nOr him admitting to literally grabbing whomever he wants by the pussy?\nYah, you don't care about rape victims. Nice try though."

'you werent even alive back then, the fuck do you know?'
'We want to hear the payoff was authorized by Trump.  I highly doubt his attorney would sign an agreement in his name without fully making him aware of it, as that would be fraud.  So if they payoff was authorized by Trump, and Michael Cohen out of the goodness of his heart made that payment, then that’s an in-kind contribution to his campaign and Michael Cohen goes to jail.  If Trump authorized the payment, and Michael Cohen made the arrangements on Trumps orders, and Michael Cohen was reimbursed with campaign funds, then that’s against FEC campaign laws.  Then we are in a constitutional crisis because how do you charge a sitting president? '

"No, im not saying it didnt happen, but lying about a blow job sure as shit is meaningless compared to Trumps wrong doings. Why the fuck do you think Clinton should have any bearing here any way, did you see me makign excuses for him? Did i point at someone else to distract from Clinton? No see thats how you operate, because your a fucking partisan fucking jack ass. and a brainless one at that. Clinton WAS impeached. Do you actually think it makes any difference to me? Do you actually know how the world and politics really works beyond your own toe the party line bullshit? \n\nNow go take more english lessons. you're usign the wrong dialect for an American, fuck wit."
"Help how? it is just  a boring sex scandal with some campaign finance issues. He has done and will continue to do much more heinous. And no I don't want him impeach on that. The whole dereliction fo duty and stealing multiple orders of magnitude more money and using office for personal enrichment are issues worth actually discussing impeachment over. Stormy Daniels is nothing but stupid salacious headlines to cover the real theft because it gets to talk about sex instead of actual policy. \n\nAnd fuck off with that problem with america bullshit. It won't work because it shouldn't. Impeach him for the things that matter. Don't be like the republican scum who force impeachment on technicalities. "
'Why is this comment being downvoted? I think fullofwind is right. The FBI could’ve charged Trump with something by now but they want to build the whole case and charge the guy at the top by the fullest extent of the law.\n\nIf there was treason and/or deleriction of duty involved then THAT should go into  Congressional record.\n\nBut yes if he’s out of office he gets little to no chance to further damage the US and the world. Things are delicate as it is and we are inching toward war here with the recent nerve agent attack. We really need to be asking tough questions about deleriction of duty if not conspiracy.'
'Yes you have a point about crimes against the state and criminal proceedings, but this is not a criminal proceeding (minus the legal hot water Cohen could be in with the FEC and potentially the Bar)'
'First of all it’s not just consensual sex, an affair is classed as adultery in the state of New York, where Trump was a resident at the time. \n\nSecondly Trump used his lawyer to set up an illegal LLC in Delaware 11 days before the election, specifically to pay a porn star hush money so she wouldn’t announce that they had an affair. He broke numerous laws by doing this, so it’s not about the affair, it’s about the illegality of his actions after the affair. '
"Then you won't mind admitting he puts a penis in his mouth and sucks on it and then swallows cum, right? I mean, only a Russian would be bothered by typing such a crazy ass lie on social media, right? Go ahead. Say it..."

"Clinton is not in the same league as Trump. Most of the anti-Clinton stuff is bullshit by the Right, so it's hard to tell what's real. The Clinton Foundation is highly rated by every independent charity rating organization, so ever time the Clinton's secured a large donation, they were doing charity. Trump had a Trump Foundation. It was literally a slush fund for Trump's legal bills and shut down by the NY authorities. The GOP investigated Hillary for years with Ben Gazi, it was all political and they came up with nothing. From Whitewater onwards, nothing except Bill's lie about a BJ. The Clintons had actually spent part of their lives in public service.  \n  \nTrump is an erratic, lazy fraud, an extreme narcissist who only ever did things for his own benefit. Trump is bigoted and racist, and very  ignorant, with bad judgement. Trump sucked at business, crashing and burning into bankruptcy often. What money he did have depended on ripping people off, fraud, and money laundering."
"You're right about the state charges, so it comes down to if Cohen is willing to go to prison for Trump. Trump has a lot of resources. My feeling is a deal will be struck.

It's important not to be like those right wing idiots who said that Obama was submitting to Japan."
'The anger just kept building for a moment there, and then I remembered:\n\nAt the end of the day, this guy is going to be remembered as a disgusting national embarrassment, like a mustard stain on our flag.

The difference between Democrats and Republicans is the same as a salesman swelling quality goods, and one selling snake oil.\n\n\nQuality sells it's self. \n\n\nSnake oil needs clever arguments, fallacies, lies, fear of not having it, and charisma to sell. \n\n\n\nThe left didn't need to scream and yell about every fuck-up and constant fear mongering to get voters.

'Also, some defendants get very anxious or are terrible at speaking, which could be misconstrued as indicatin guilt by a jury. The 5th keeps that from happening as even the most innocent of people can get nervous or jumpy when being grilled by an experienced prosecutor.'
"That's a Miranda warning, based on the 5th Amendment but it's not the 5th Amendment. If you're being arrested then you're already on the criminal side of things, not civil.\n\nThe actual 5th Amendment is pretty clear:\n\n> No person... shall be compelled **in any criminal case** to be a witness against himself"
"IANAL, but I don't think the 5th applies to only to criminal charges or even pending charges.  You can plead the fifth to civil charges as well.  And it has nothing to do with whether charges are pending or not... say you're called to testify in a trial, and you're not the defendant.  Some lawyer asks you a question that would force you to admit to a crime... even though you're not on trial, and no charges are pending, you still have the right to plead the fifth and not incriminate yourself.  This keeps you from having to perjure yourself."

The fact he’s hated by both sides of the establishment should be a wake up call to anyone that understands the rot infesting our government, and the one man in our lifetime who can do something about it is being attacked at all costs by those who want to keep their power to rape this nation’s constitution.

'Did you just say that Trump being hated on by both sides, [which is not true in the slightest,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-are-coming-home-to-trump/) points out how bad *other* people are? Is that not ironic? The FBI members you were just talking about have been appointed by Trump himself, *according to a Republican.* Is it not sketchy in the slightest that Trump is hating on the only group of people who can prove his innocence? They investigated the Clinton emails right before the election date, so that didn’t help them push their evil liberal narrative.\n\nI find this argument to be a red herring. The massive agencies failure to look at some mass shootings in one area does not mean that people who investigate politicians suddenly have less of a leg to stand on.\n\nAlso, if Trump got kicked out of office, they will replace him with Pence, so I don’t understand why the 🅱️eep state would want to bother with him in the first place.

Cohen\'s lawyer responded:\n\n>Hendon responds to government\'s suggestion that Cohen is "not a real lawyer." **"That may be right,** that may be wrong," she says, but adds someone who "holds these views and expresses them publicly cannot be counted upon" to vindicate attorney-client privilege.\n\nThings you don\'t want to hear a judge say to you:\n\n>Judge Wood, to Cohen\'s attorneys: "It’s not that you’re not good people.

"Hannity pretends to be a journalist.  One of the most influential conservative media and Trump's biggest cheerleader on Fox News.\n\nA journalist discloses when they have a personal relationship with someone they are reporting on so people know they may be biased.

Any reputable news organization would fire you for this."
"If we're being honest, it's not likely to be significant at all. Unless there's some tie wherein Trump and Cohen used Hannity to advance their crimes (which would mean Hannity was a co-conspirator, not a client of Cohen), the worst it's likely to do is highlight a conflict of interest for Hannity. \n\nThat could undermine his journalistic reputation, but he has no reputation anyway, and his listeners aren't likely to care about any conflict of interest unless it contradicts his message. \n\nEdit to note that u/AllUrMemes is correct.

Unfortunately, they have rationalized that if they speak out, they won't get re-elected and therefore won't be able to do anything about it.\n\nIt's craven cowardice and will be remembered going forward.\n\nSome will claim that the Democrats, in a similar position, would do the same.

"No, we were pissed that Comey made it public so close to the election - which even he has said was a bad move. \n\nThis whole two sides to the same coin shit is why we have total chaos in the executive right now. If you actually knew anything about presidential history you would know that none of the shit that is going on in the WH is normal or acceptable. It's destructive to the office and is setting dangerous precedents for the future. Please actually learn how to put current events into CONTEXT beyond what happened last year. "
'You’re lying - The FBI/Comey did not draft a letter clearing Clinton before the investigation was complete. \n\nYou’re wrong - there are no secret societies and no evidence. It’s an insane idea. \n\nYou’re wrong again: The FBI texts show nothing of what you say they show. \n\nI can debunk your stupidity more carefully if you’d like to show me the bullshit conspiracy theory blogs/websites you’re reading. '
'The problem is Obama didn\'t fire Comey, Trump did. Instead of having a bi-partisan investigation in to the actions of the FBI director he instead took it upon himself to fire Comey for the "Russia thing".'
"Because the emails had already been investigated by the time of Comey's announcement right before the election. The other computer was never likely to add compelling enough information to warrant the announcement.\n\nThe FBI is historically Republican and right-leaning. Comey is a Republican. After the years of desperate searches for something on Hillary, after way more hearings on Benghazi than on 9/11, after all the desperation you guys have shown to bury the Clintons, you got nothing.\n\nYour politicians are way dirtier. They handle their security way more carelessly. They behave like the law doesn't apply to them. How many people in the White House don't have security clearance and handle top-secret information? How many current staffers are using private email servers today? How much money is Trump pocketing off the Presidency? You thought Hillary was corrupt so you voted for a casino-owning gangster? The hypocrisy is ridiculous. "

"I'm saying the democrats didn't fire the head of the fbi because they hated an investigation. If you don't see how that is different I can't help you."
'Seriously dude? The FBI director collecting final information to draft a letter? That’s you’re “evidence”? \n\nOut of two investigations into her emails and like 9 investigations into Benghazi, there were no indictments, no firings, no nothing.  But corrupt Hillary got off easy.  \n\nBut during the investigation into the “Russia thing” we’ve had 4 indictments and two guilty pleas.  But this is a biased investigation pushed by the dems.  \n\nLet me give you a recap of how we got here.  A Republican FBI director started an investigation into a Republican presidential candidate because his republican staffers got drunk and ran their mouth about meeting with Russians, and once elected the Republican president fired the Republican FBI director which was then replaced by a Republican special council who was appointed by a Republican Deputy AG that was appointed by the Republican president they are investigating after the Republican AG, also appointed by the Republican president, after he recused himself for being involved, all the while a Republican controlled house and a Republican controlled senate look on and create memos that only make them all look worse and complicit in the whole thing.  \n\nBut the dems are totally behind this and making up this fake news, totally.  '
'Ok sure, but Comey was just doing his job, the man isnt political, i think thats obvious, he forwarded the info to congress and the rats there leaked the info to the media.\nTo try and influence the election, people should have been upset at chaffetz, the rat fuck that leaked the info.\n\nBut dems were crucifying Comey, as though it were his fault. He was just doing his job, but when he rightfully went after Trump, dems were riding his dick, i hated that.\n\nAnd it wasnt weeks before election day, it was a day or 2 before it i believe.'
'Oh, I\'ve read them all. Here\'s some fun ones:\n\n\n"So look, you say we text on that phone when we talk about hillary because it can\'t be traced, you were just venting bc you feel bad that you\'re gone so much but it can\'t be helped right now"\n\n\n"Maybe it should just be the first meeting of the secret society"\n\n\n\n"He changed President to \'another senior government official\'"\n\n\n"An investigation leading to impeachment?"\n\n\n\nI see no way you can read through these and not come to the conclusion they want to do everything in their power to fight Trump, be it illegal or not.'
'No, you obviously haven’t read all the texts. For example, the “secret society” message is a joke - I.e she was joking trump would be a dictator so a “secret society” would be formed. \n\nYou seriously think a conspiracy in the FBI would be so stupid and blatant? Man you’re dumb '
'>you didn\'t come to the same conclusion as me so obviously you\'re lying.\n\nThis is an example of a logical fallacy known as "affirming the consequent." Affirming the consequent means you are assuming there is only one explanation for the observation you are making. The fact of the matter is: he may be lying to you, he may not. But it is wrong to assume he is simply because he arrived at a different conclusion than you.'
"We're probably splitting hairs but I think Dems are still mad that police depts politicize at all. The FBI still did Clinton dirty, and it's a shame that Trump had to royally piss them off to get them to look into his dealings when he's been a crook for decades.\n\nThis country doesn't prosecute our elites, liberal or conservative, and it's a problem. The only reason Enron or Bernie Madoff went down was because it turned out they had run out of money and so other rich people got screwed. When Trump has run out of money in the past he got out of it through bankruptcy, branding and eventually Russian financing. His deep debt to foreign interests should have been a red flag to the FBI pre-election. But it's like the FBI has been told to stand down on elites for decades now. "
"And you could have called him out for his ad homenim attacks. You're not stupid for believing something. And making it seem like you are doesn't win that guy the argument. It degrades his own. "
"This is so backwards  \n  \nEdit: I looked at some old AskTrumpSupporters threads on Steele's credibility. The mental backflips necessary to arrive at this point of view is mind boggling. Steele is a competent former MI6 agent, with sources who betray Russia. He found out about a Russian conspiracy to mess with our election, and told the FBI. On the other hand, the Trump Team meets over and over with Russians, just like Steele's plot would indicate, and nobody from Team Trump goes to the FBI. Even though Team Trump was specifically warned about Russians who will try to infiltrate their campaign. Instead, the Trump people concealed their Russian contacts/meetings, and lied to the public, the FBI, and Congress."

'I\'m from the UK, and so I have a slightly different perspective on things. I have a pretty terrible opinion of the Clintons. I also think Trump is a rubbish president. So to me, all of this Whataboutery is irrelevant because I hold them both in disregard. \n\nThe way I see it, if you get caught shooting somebody in the face, shouting "That guy over there is a rapist" doesn\'t make you any less of a murderer. In any case, Hilary is not the President, Trump is and should be held accountable for his behaviour. He certainly appears to be acting helluva guilty so I say let the investigation run its course and see what the outcome is.'
'You’re creating a false equivalency here.  The Clinton investigation, was one point.  The dreaded evil server from which she was storing classified information.  That’s it.  It was a simple question of did she intentionally mishandle data on a personal server.  And the resounding answer from the FBI and the inspector generals report of the investigation of the investigation is a hard NO.  If you’re that worried about Hillary releasing classified data, why aren’t you protesting Trump when he in person told Russian ambassadors about an Israeli spy, releasing classified information and burning an intelligence asset in one conversation.  \n\nWith the Trump  investigation, it’s a web of stuff each in its own right bigger than the entire Clinton server scandal.  Each point of the Trump investigation, in a typical presidency, would have garnered its own special counsel investigation.  \n\nManafort and Gates, regardless of the crimes they have committed and been indicted for, and in Gates case, pleaded guilty to, Trump hired two unregistered foreign agents to run his campaign.  \n\nFlynn, also an unregistered foreign agent that was hatching a plan to kidnap a Turkish refugee and ship him back to his pal Erdogan.  \n\nTrump Jr, his own son.  Setting meetings with Russian Assets for the express purpose of getting dirt on Hillary.  And also, meeting with some other bad actors from the Middle East offering help on a disinformation campaign.  \n\nKushner, his own son in law, taking meetings in his official capacity with bankers, that just so happened to bail his ass out with a few hundred million in Loans.  Also he met with a Russian ambassador seeking a back channel to the Russians.  \n\nOr Michael Cohen, his personal lawyer.  That set up a consulting company weeks before the election and starting accepting bribes, I mean consulting fees, to give “insights” into the Trunp administration on Healthcare, telecom, and aerospace.  Cause his years of being a two bit lawyer and Taxi operator has given him experience in this.  \n\nVanderzwaan, some Dutch banker.  That just so happens to be married to an Oligarchs daughter.  The same oligarch that owns Alfa bank.  The same Alfa bank that was communicating via a private server in Trump Tower.  99% of that servers traffic was made up of Alfa Bank and Betsy Devos’ husbands company.  You remember our friend Betsy? Our education secretary? \n\nSpeaking of Betsy, her Brother Erik Price, mercenary Guy. Well he had a meeting in the Seychelles with a Russian with the purpose of setting up a back channel to Putin.  The president doesn’t need a back channel.  He has a specific phone directly linked to the Kremlin, anytime he needs to check in.  \n\nAny single one of these chance encounters or friendly chats is a bigger issue than whatever Hillary did on her email server.  \n'
'It’s not helpful, even trump supporters have a right to give an opinion on how their country is run.. I am British, and voted remain in an 80% leave area.

The "Alt" label is a mark of shame, and for the most part the left doesn\'t have that gaping fucking chasm of a divide that the right has.\n\nThe right using the term "Alt-left" is like a kid getting mocked for having glasses, turning around and saying "No, YOUR glasses are dumb!" to a bunch of bullies that aren\'t actually wearing glasses.

"Maybe, but I've read plenty of strongly left leaning opinion pieces that say the same thing.  I'm no lawyer, so I can't be certain.\n\nIn any case with 5 conservative justices any SC case regarding Trump will have to be bullet proof.  I doubt Mueller would take the risk.

"This would be a bad thing for Trump, arguably worse than not being pardoned. At least if he's not pardoned he can work a legal battle to avoid state level charges (which the NY AG will undoubtedly pursue) because accepting a pardon is legally considered the same as confirming guilt for whatever crimes were committed. As a pardon only cleanses federal charges, guilt on the state level for anything which might also be applicable at the state level would be an issue, especially as being pardoned (iirc) would disallow you from being able to plead the fifth.

I read the news articles waiting to hear that maybe they hacked a voting machine or something worth extreme outrage, but all i hear about is their facebook campaigns and twitter accounts. If democracy can be subverted by  shitposting then we have a lot more to worry about than what Trump does.'
"One side is fighting against it. We acknowledge and accept that it has happened. We aren't calling people out as Russian trolls and idiots as an attempt to divide the nation, we are doing it because we are trying to combat the belief system that the Russian trolls are still actively spreading. They aren't spreading a message of tolerance and understanding, they are spreading and are convincing willing Americans to spread a message of hatred and fear. They have convinced one side to happily spread fake news and to call anything against their belief system fake news. We call them out because they were able to convince people to put someone at the highest levels of government who would spread those ideals.\n\nWe are calling people out as Russian trolls because it is literally still ongoing on this website, and across the internet. We are tired of people ignoring the problem, or brushing it aside, or even denying it is happening. \n\n"
'You seem out of touch or intentionally ignorant. We’re not here to feed you, go catch up on some news if you fail to see what’s going on.'
'That’s it? You think that the only people that could be involved in this scam are the ones who know how to code?'
"Lol you've been consuming so many conspiracy theories that your paranoia is now uncontrollable. You guys need to take a serious look at your lives though. You're a laughing stock to most already and quickly becoming one to the rest of the world to. There's still time to recover and maybe win the next presidential election but not if you keep up like this. It's time to recognize that you failed miserably in 2016 and it's only going to continue that way if you use keep Russians or Nazis or Trump as scapegoats. Pls."
"Man, T_D's faggots are invading."
'Guys look it’s the democratic version of Obama as a monkey. \n\nToo bad nobody here is empathetic enough to be able to see that people who are fine with this are no better than the Obama racists. \n\nLong live the two party system! As long as I have a choice I’m not just getting unilaterally fucked right!!?  '
'You\'d think with all this fake news circulating about "trump-russia collusion", they\'d at least have something better than this shitty meme.  \n\nWho\'s gonna post about Clinton\'s ACTUAL russian collusion, that has been PROVEN?   \n\nRule # 1, if the leftists accuse others of something nefarious, they are in fact the ones who are guilty of the exact thing they project.'
"No, it's a sub for both following the investigation and mocking T_D.  You seem desperate and/or confused."
'Hating someone because they chose to be a piece of shit is the same as being a racist.\n\nReichwinger logic.'

'As for the delusions of Trumpkin snowflakes, I am having a nice brunch and there is a working class couple brainwashed by the cult of Trump loudly annoying everyone.  Here is what I learned.\n\n1.  Apparently Trump is going to break up all the evil pharmaceutical company.\n\n2.  Bob Mueller is corrupt because of uranium.\n\n3.  Obama should be waterboarded.\n\n4.  Everyone who has not swallowed the Kool-Aid in Chicago is a Clinton-tron.  And also people totally like his Trump bumper sticker in, you know Chicago.\n\n5.  Sessions should be fired for not investigating Deep State corruption.\n\n6.  Deep State is trying to kill Trump.\n\n7.

'I disagree, only in the sense that letting the dirt eating morons in to spout gibberish is really, really funny.\n\nPlus compounded by their being thin-skinned, weepy little pussies about everything... \n\nIts like a perfect storm of lulz.

Same way when wanna be islamic terrorists try to buy weapons and bomb making materials and it turns out their contacts are fbi agents. They have talked about armed uprisings, 2 of them have already done stuff that would put them on the fbi radar. "
'And yet people say Fox News is as bad as MSNBC. "Hitler, thumbs down! Brushing your teeth after drinking OJ, thumbs down!"'
"> They're openly brigading us. Why aren't we issuing bans?\n\nHaving managed forums that have been targeted by trolls, a few things helped;\n\n* Ban early and ban often anyone who is part of a brigade or who uses terms that trolls use exclusively, and remove the threads and comments of those that are banned.   This helps if the bans are aggressive (within minutes not hours) as it removes the payback the trolls so desire; they can't report back and demonstrate their dickishness to other potential trolls.\n\n* As there can be mistakes, let any account that is banned know up front that they can request the ban be lifted.  \n\n* Make it visible, at least to the moderators, that a post is from a new account on Reddit or from someone who has never been on the forum or if the person posting a new thread is a suspected troll.\n\n* Use a bot to report possible trolls to the moderators so they can review and act on that information in real time.\n\n* Encourage people to report abuse to the moderators and have the moderators actively review reports of abuse.\n\n* Depending on the forum and the actions of the abuser(s), let the community sort it out.  Trust the regulars on the forum to pummel the assholes when they misbehave.\n\n* Always treat trolls as technical problems, not personal ones.  The goal is to have a good forum, not to troll the trolls.\n\nNotes: Overt trolls tend not to request a ban removal ... and they just make new accounts to continue the troll.  Yet, even trolls get bored making new accounts and intentional abusers can be reported to the Reddit admins.  If this is done carefully, and with enough evidence, the Reddit admins will act on the serial trolls and boot the person (not just the accounts used to troll) from Reddit or shadowban them."

'The issue I have with them is they are armed with made up controversies and stories to shove in your face as evidence you can’t instantly say “that’s not a thing” or “that’s a non issue”.\n\nIt hard to be informed of facts as it is. let alone when you have to know the conspiracy theories that are being touted as fact and the facts of that as well.

'TD is a pro Trump only subreddit. It says so in the rules. It is NOT A forum for debate. Plenty of people are banned from r/Hillaryclinton for polite rebuttals. \n\nThere is nothing deluded about that. It’s cut and dry.'
'A long time ago (decades, it seems, in Trump-time) one of the brigading dipshits from dipshitstan got confused about which sub he was on, and reported me to the mods here for being a dissenter.  He wrote a bunch of comments (later deleted) about how I was about to have my ban handed to me.  \n\nIt was soon after that I was banned from shiteatersville (without ever having visited), and targeted for brigading on every comment I made for the next several days.\n\nGood times.'
"A: For the most part, the people that come in from that subreddit aren't the ones banning anyone.\n\nB: The fact that the ones who frequent here repeatedly enter what is a hostile space implies that they can in fact handle dissenting opinion. If you want to call the ones who only stay in their safe space a snowflake, that's one thing, but the same label doesn't really fit to those who frequent subreddits that are very hostile to their opinions.\n\nAnd by the way, for those of you who will inevitably call me some sort of T_D shill, I was banned from there more than a year ago for being vocally critical of Israel, so that label won't apply, either."

Not only are they under pressure to find the 1 of 5 to keep the forum going, at times they may be 1 of 5.  If there\'s a way out for reasonable people, then that\'s what should be emphasized not taking offense from people who aren\'t being paid and who still want to do the right thing.\n\n> I\'m wary of automatic bans,\n\nI didn\'t say \'automatic ban\' as if no matter what, some characteristic automatically kicks in a ban.  So, don\'t mischaracterize what I did say.  Fair?\n\n> especially over the use of words that are "trolls use exclusively." I just don\'t trust people\'s judgment to make that call accurately.\n\nExcessive leeway gives trolls cover, and encourages them to increase their abuses.

"In all honesty, McCain's capable of changing stances whenever he feel the situation too insulting. He went into total hawk mode after he got screwed by Bush with Bangladesh baby false rumors, he became 93% Republican after Palin shit blasted his possible presidency before Magnitsky fiasco turned him moderate again, and he actually had decent stances in many things that required common sense.\n\nToday McCain's unfortunately not the same. He took the most NRA money and some other shady donations. There were even rumors that he agreed with the tax cuts because he wants to leave his family the necessary money on his death. I've read many of his statements and i could see that his heart still has that same compassion, but it seems that he had been roped by many things he could not escape.\n"

"That's the thing with how the law is set up in most places (at least in the US).  Technically, virtually everyone is almost always committing some sort of minor crime, in the most technical sense, often subject to the subjective viewpoint of the arresting officer.  What this means is that if the officer wants to, they can pretty much arrest anyone they want at any time, even if it's not going to hold up in court.  They can still ruin your life for a week or so, minimum, and a lot of poor people are in such tenuous financial straits at any given time that a week's disruption in their ability to work would directly decimate that person's family's ability to eat and meet other basic necessities on a day to day basis.  This is where the rubber meets the road when it comes to police enforcement, especially amongst the poor.  If you don't show the proper respect and deference to the officer in question, and they decide they don't like that, they can essentially ruin that person's life, even though they have committed no crime, perhaps other than lacking the interpersonal attitude that the officer would've preferred.  It's a real problem, and it should be addressed.  How to do this will be left as an exercise for the reader. :)"

'I could not agree more. The justice system affords the police and procecutors lots of discretion. It always reminded me of the eye in Lord of the rings. Always looking and searching.

'Trump paid for the Stormy Daniels payoff. Therefore it\'s not a campaign finance violation.\n\nTrump wanted Comey to investigate Russian collusion within his campaign if it existed. So says Comey in his own memos. He fired him because Comey refused to tell the public he wasn\'t personally under investigation. Therefore it\'s not obstruction.\n\nHe has every constitutional right to fire Comey and Sessions or Rosenstein.\n\nA sitting president can\'t be indicted. \n\nThere\'s no collusion.\n\nIt\'s clear Mueller knows no more than what has been reported already and is fishing given the questions they plan to ask.\n\nMcCabe, Comey others in the FBI and DOJ and even the Obama whitehouse have either been caught doing illegal things are acting in a partisan way to attack a democraticly elected president and it\'s them who have used "evidence" gathered from Russia to be used to first influence an election and then to remove a democraticly elected president.\n\nSorry I\'m I missing something. Why do you think this is going to end up with impeaching Trump?\n\nThere\'s just no way. Muller doesn\'t have a thing and when the American people realize it\'s all been a witch hunt I think they will finally be able to see the man behind the curtain.\n\nThis will go to the Supreme Court and Trump will win easily.'
"Gosh, I hate to break it to you folks, but the Stormy Daniels thing happened long before Trump was president and wasn't breaking any laws.\n\nAlso, why are we still talking collusion? Clapper, Yates, Brennan, Comey, Feinstein etc... ALL SAY THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION.\n\nNow the OIG report on the other hand... "
"I hate to say it but as someone who took care of his parent with Alzheimer's the last years of his life, there are parellels here that are not being unnoticed by some.\nFred Trump passed away at around 93 years of age, suffering from Dementia brought on by Alzheimer's. Apparently according to most news sources, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's around 8 years before at the age of 84/85. But back in the day, the onset of Alzheimer's was not noticeable as it was not studied as much, the onset of dementia is the final phase but even longer before that, it manifests itself with changes in personality in that its victims become impatient, are more argumentative and seem to be more closed minded about their opinions. Sound Familiar?\n\nI watched this in my father over the years and before that my grandmother, so I am at risk, and I take it seriously, hoping that recent science advances may cure this disease. I was tested recently and was classified as not having the gene that promotes this, however it's not known if the genes is a classic indicator of the disease or just coincidental.\n\nI do not think Trump has Alzheimer's, at this time, but he may have some precursors, that I am sure others are looking at to. It might not manifest itself in someone who is in his early 70's, but the initial personality changes can happen at this time.\n\nWith all the fal-der-all with the only two physicians to actually examine him, may be another bullet point. Doctors have a confidentiality oath to their patients, but Trump has a known history of punishing and awarding those who have intimate knowledge of his weaknesses.\n\nIn his last two years of his Presidency, Ronald Reagan was identified with Alzheimer after the fact, and in his last year, it had gotten so bad that there were days were he was not cognizant of where he actually was, according to Nancy Reagan. This leads me to believe there may be more and more professionals looking at his behavior and his decision making process at this time under stress.The problem is, is that his behavior, while boorish, is not anywhere near being close to dementia or an early onset Alzheimers, so we may see the end game her processed by an very stubborn person whose behavior no one can explain."
"Holy shit.

When the pee pee tape is finally popped in by Mueller to watch for the first time, he's greeted instead by\n\nTOWER OF TWINS subtitle STORMY & RUDY'S WILD RIDE subtitle UNRATED UNCUT UNPRESIDENTED\n\nand we're all going to be cucks who, after all this time, got btfo.

'Yes, him sleeping with Stormy Daniels happened before he was president.  The illegal campaign contribution/pay off was done during his campaign.

"A candidate can spend his own money. Ross Perot spent a fortune of his own money. It's not a violation.\n\nNone of the indictments have anything to do with collusion. Manafort and Gates are to do with money laundering and the others are due to lying to the FBI but there's no evidence or even suspicion either men colluded with Russian.\n\nI think there's a possibility Manafort did. I think even Trump suspects he may have and he wanted Comey to investigate this. I think this is what he meant when he said he wanted Comey to investigate the issue with respect to his campaign.\n\nIt's your version that has no basis in reality.\n\nWe are all waiting for the smoking gun but it's clear from those questions that were leaked there is no smoking gun."

We just don't have a right to know. There's no law saying a politician needs to release this and the American people didn't care since they voted for him.\n\nThe reason this is a witch hunt is because normally.\n\nAn investigation is into a specific crime looking for a perpetrator.\n\nThis is an investigation into a specific person looking for a crime.\n\nIt's a massive abuse of the justice and political system and when Mueller finally is forced to the supreme Court to get his subpoena this will all be exposed."
"If he directed the activity of his campaign then he is guilty of violating federal election laws. \n\nThis has everything to do with echo chambers.

It was more biased for Trump than the Clinton campaign was for Clinton. "

'Too bad for him, there\'s no "bitch" running in 2020....If he makes it to 2020.'
"The law isn't clear at all on the point. What you're saying has always been the assumption, with the key argument being that a criminal case will be too distracting to the President. However, the long dragged out impeachments (ref. Clinton) - especially as it hampers Congress too - goes counter to this argument. For this reason many want to challenge that principle and have it tried before the courts."
'I used to get mad, but now I just feel sorry for people like this. Clearly so many things had to have gone wrong for someone to end up this clueless. And this is exactly why the GOP are actively sabotaging public education: they don’t want critical thinkers.

It was a political circus, and there was no way the Republicans would have allowed the criminal courts to take the lead.\n\nHere we're seeing the opposite. The crimes (if proven) are very serious crimes, and Congress doesn't want to pursue it for political reasons."

Clinton may not have been responsible, but she didn't win friends with her dismissing questions of what the cause of the attack *was.\n\nI'm pissed that Trump won.  The only consolation is Clinton lost.  Bring on the third parties."

'Are any of you going to ever mention that ALL of the evidence to get Papadopoulos was provided by the Trump white house? That they knew his was dirty and turned him in? That they cooperated with Mueller completely to get a bad guy? That they led Mueller to the indictment?\n\nNo?\n\n'
'Reminder: The Manafort and Gates indictments have no relation to Trump or the Trump campaign.

"Yeah it would have been awkward to keep them on after they flubbed colluding.  It's a bad look. "
"If there's evidence they're guilty of something, sure.\n\nI don't think you Redcaps get the point here. We (aka Real Americans) aren't treating this like a game. If a conspiracy to undermine American democracy was carried out, we want the people involved to face justice. We don't give a shit if they were right or left, if they worked for the RNC or DNC - if they betrayed the country, they should be in prison. That's what The_Mueller's working for, and if it involves the Podestas then great!\n\nIt just so happens that the Republican Party has essentially become a front for a criminal organization, so it seems a lot more likely that indictments are headed for that camp. But if they (or rather the rest of them) don't - no skin off my nose. I just want the criminals behind bars."
'And?  That won\'t stop the investigation.  Or absolve any crimes committed by the Trump administration.  It just adds a few Dem scalps to Mueller\'s pile.\n\nAnd just a reminder.  Clinton was impeached over perjury about a blowjob.  That Special Counsel was investigating a land deal from a decade before he became President.  \n\nAs long as all these politicians haven\'t done anything or lied in the last 20 years they\'ll be safe.  But if they "forgot" something on a government form somewhere, established a quid pro quo with a foreign agent or took laundered money, they\'ll be going to prison.  I expect that Rob Mueller will be far more thorough and impartial than Ken Starr ever was.'
'You will find the brains of that victory in Moscow. Trump is a fooking Moron. His only possibility of not being guilty is that he is too much of a Moron to even understand what is happening to him.'
"Dude, what kool-aid are you drinking?\n\nTwo people got arrested today for their ties to Russia. Manafort was Trump's campaign chairman, and Gates was his deputy. A third indictment was unsealed and said Papadopoulous was a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign who repeatedly tried to set up meetings between Trump and Putin. Papadopoulos plead guilty months ago.\n\nIn what world does high-ranking Trump campaign officials getting arrested for taking Russian bribes, trying to set up Trump-Putin meetings and lying to the FBI about it connect them with Clinton?"

I think the facts surrounding the Manafort trial open that idea up to a bit of speculation. The judge in the Manafort trial threw a fit about how Mueller\'s team were handling things. Manafort attempted to argue in court that Mueller\'s scope of work shouldn\'t pertain to events prior to the 2016 election. The thing is, Mueller\'s scope of work is still classified, the memo setting his scope, is classified. After Manafort tried arguing, the judge ruled that Mueller\'s scope was to include ANY illegality of individuals involved in any way with the Trump campaign during the 2016 election. This means that Mueller\'s scope is larger than just the election. \n\nWhat do you know about the potential FISA abuse leading up to the 2016 election?\n\nI know that the charges being laid against Manafort at this point in time were known and investigated by the DOJ, I think prior to or in 2015. Manafort argued that because these allegations were part of separate DOJ investigations, Mueller shouldn\'t be allowed to include them as part of the "Special Counsel Investigation". \n\nThink about that one for a second. The charges that Mueller is charging Manafort with, were investigated and known long before the 2016 Presidential Election. Long before Manafort was a chairman of a presidential election campaign.\n\nAnd now Mueller is applying those charges.\n\n'

The jet was hit while flying over Iran's territorial waters in the Persian Gulf along the flight's usual route. Vincennes had entered Iranian territorial waters after one of its helicopters drew warning fire from Iranian speedboats operating within Iranian territorial limits.According to the United States government, the crew of the Vincennes had incorrectly identified the Airbus as an attacking F-14 Tomcat, a U.S.-made jet fighter that had been part of  the Iranian Air Force inventory since the 1970s.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28"

"The Trump campaign had no involvement in 'Russian meddling.' It has become apparent over and over again that establishment politicians were in touch and possibly actively colluded with foreign actors to create not just the narrative of Donald Trump doing 'something' that might have been unappealing or perceived as unethical business-wise when the crimes committed by a larger ring of people to influence the election are getting more serious. It raises the possibility that illegal activity can be traced back to the previous administration. Very serious."
"That's the fundamental truth in this. What gets in the way is the narrative(s) that people *want* to pursue. The underlying problem with this sub is that 99% of the people who subscribe and post here think that Donald Trump is guilty of some outrageous crime when everything leading up to the 2016 election reeks of political insider manipulation and with every peripheral revelation (the Fusion GPS testimony 'leak' the most recent) the pool of guilty names grows larger, deeper and darker. My views on this go back to Bill Browder's testimony to our government about Russian influence and collusion with specific people within the US government to overturn the Magnitsky Act.

It is an objective fact that he blabbed intel to people he should not have blabed it to, his lawyers hate him because he says things constantly to make his situation worse. He is bad at his job, thats why we want him gone. No one wants to overturn an election. Impeachment doesn't mean we revert to hillary being president. This comes down to whether or not people can face facts that Donny is no good at this. Plugging your ears and pretending it isn't happening isn't helping our country. Leave everything else alone and you still have this fact: Donald can't do the job properly. He has to go. "
'Holding classified documents on a private server is a crime, and if it isn\'t, then it should be. Don\'t forget about the purge of their emails.\n\nhttps://www.factcheck.org/2016/09/the-fbi-files-on-clintons-emails/\n\n>FBI Director James Comey on July 5 announced that although Clinton and her staff were “extremely careless” in handling classified information, the FBI did not find evidence that their actions were intentional. He declined to pursue criminal charges.\n\nA bit further down:\n\n>It turned out that Keilar’s assumption was accurate. The 31,830 personal emails that Keilar asked about were deleted “sometime between March 25-31, 2015,” according to the FBI. That was about three weeks after Clinton received a House subpoena on March 4, 2015.\n\nLooking at these and the rest of the events surrounding her emails, it is very clear that she was hiding something. Hillary is not squeaky clean like you are trying to say she is. Even just being "extremely careless" with handling classified information shows incompetence, and do you really think she is dumb enough to have honestly made that mistake?'

"One is blaming your opponents for the crimes you're committing. For example, if you're guilty of colluding with Russia/Mafia accuse your opponent of the same. Also accusing dissenting media of lying/fake is a classic Russian dictatorial play"
"Clinton won the primary by 4 million votes, 16m to 12m -- How the fuck is that rigged? I'm so sick of reading this bullshit narrative, especially on anti-trump subs."
"> if the people's will wasn't subverted in the primary\n\nThat's fake news, kiddo.  During the primary, right at the end, there was about a three week period where although it was mathematically impossible for Bernie to win, he was refusing to concede.  Dems needed to get behind one candidate fast and Bernie was slowing things down for no good reason.  That was when that email was sent that this fake news is based on.  Ya'll are acting like the entire primary was tilted for Hillary, but it wasn't.  Do your homework and check the dates on the email that started this whole fake story.  You are being played by fake news.\n\nWake up.\n"
'So it’s like projection.\n\n\nI’m a selfish jerk so I see and accuse you of being a selfish jerk (for example)'
'Ahhh.. you sound so reasonable and sincere....

"I'm cascadian, Man, I hate NY as much as I hate Russia. All I know is the country stops working if we all stop trying. \n\nEDIT: also, bot? For real? X'D"
"What's a Cascadian? What's your point? \n\nPeople wake up and TRY every day and nothing gets better... and their efforts are perpetually wasted on corrupted institutions like the DFL. \n\nAmericans will continue to work and try...and continue to fail because our political/economical institutions have failed. \n\nWhat in God's good name are you talking about?"
'So no real arguments, just more namecalling?  Classic Trumptard.'
"How and why is it broken?? \n\nSeriously... if you're so aware then why are you so easily distracted by the oligarchs - doing what oligarchs do? \n\nPutin and internationalist want to influence US elections?? Yeah... no shit.\n\nIt's not nihilism... it's a principled stance against the obvious failures of our system. How is predictable Russian/international influence a bigger story than our own DFL subverting the people's will? \n\nHow do you care more about Russian boogeymen than the real villains within?   "
"Why? Because it's an intentional distraction from the very real problem within. Because it gives Americans another finger to point instead of looking in the mirror. Because while we continue to not clean our own house, we'll continue to live in this modern neo-liberal filth. \n\nWhy are you so scared of foreign boogeymen? \n\nIt's madness... and you think you're the sane, grown-up here... smh.\n\nNew Flash smart guy: our democracy was literally subverted by the DNC.

"Yeah, Im sure the powers that be planned this whole thing as a distraction.  Lolololol.  Why am I not surprised that the Stein voter wears a tinfoil hat?\n\nAgain, what do you know about what I can imagine?  Can I get some of those magical powers?\n\nIm not scared of foreign boogeymen, but I am scared of the spread of radical ideology like ISIS.  Why do you pretend the only problem in the world is your pet problem?\n\nAll I hear is that you are mad we're still talking about the largest political scandal in American history.  And what you want us to be discussing is what we discussed endlessly at this time last year."

'Oh boy here comes the ~~crocodile tears~~ fake outrage. '
'And I didn\'t edit anything, you just lack reading comprehension.\n\nAlso:\n\n"Daddys official statement about jill recount"  \n"Daddy gifts us a new meme"  \n"When daddy trump comes to drop some truth on you"  \n"Got my first daddy dollar today"  \n\nAnd that is just from the *titles* of the *first page* of search results. It\'s cringy as fuck, and you\'re wrong.'
'I think Trump gives new meaning to the saying, "Fuck bitches, get money."'
"You're right but the law does care. These are possible campaign finance violations. Trump may very well he prosecuted for these different payments, even if the prosecution is after he leaves office. "
'He hasn’t been wrong on anything that he stated as definite that I recall.  He was also making a big point on talk shows of explicitly saying he’s never been wrong and I’ve never heard any of the hosts contradict him even when they sometimes looked irritated at his arrogance. FWIW.'
'more like "Fucked bitches get money".'
'Fuck the country, steal their money.'
'You are all so stupid! If you rearrange all the letters in Robert Miller III it clearly says Soros plant fucking idiot libtards.  Big fat **/S**'
"I doubt Mueller is a republican anymore. But despite that, he was registered as one, and Trump is a fucking idiot and doesn't understand bi-partsonship. \n\nEDIT: Fuck me for giving an opinion"
"I have missed one election/vote out of all the ones I've ever been eligible to vote in...\n\nI'll keep doing that.\n\nHopefully stupidity won't win in the end."
'used in the book World War Z, in a way crazy style '
'That picture is probably viewed the worst in Europe. Appeals to flag loyalty is the biggest fascist act one can make here. '
'The uneven line breaks are killing me'
"Honestly? Yeah. It feels overly-familiar. He just *took ownership* of the flag, as if it's his and only his, not anyone elses and assumes a familiarity with it that feels untoward.\n\n I say this as someone that generally speaking doesn't like all the flag-worship because it allows fascists like this quisling (love that fucking word) to gain power.\n\nStill, the soldier in me recoils in disgust and mild, knee-jerk rebuke just looking at a picture of him doing it. The video was every bit as bad. It's just... *gross*."
'Thats not correct. In 1905 we stopped capital punishment for civilian crimes, but at the same time we added capital punishment in the military law. We had this until the 1970s.\n\nEdit: it is correct, we also added some new laws after the war to execute Quisling, Rinnan and other scum. Unsure what law we used to give death sentence.'
"Yeah, that's kinda what I meant. That being said, it's still hard to watch this orange Tinpot Dictator-wanna-be debase it. It's a very physical and real example of the way that same piece of shit is debasing and destroying all the ideals, and principles I thought this nation stood for. \n\nI know we weren't perfect, but I genuinely thought we were making progress. Then this fuckstick, Trump, sucks some Russian cock for power and now we're a goddamned Bananna republic beholden to Putin. \n\nFuck Trump. And Fuck republicans that empower him especially. I can only pray enough sane human beings vote in November that we can neuter the disgusting sons of bitches that think this version of America is 'good'.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
'I cannot adequately express the hatred and revulsion I feel for this monster.'
'Too bad that NDA prevents any journalist from asking Bechard anything about this. With the mountain of other scandalous topics they could potentially cover this one looked to be too much effort to report on. '
'Trump sure does fuck some hot ass women!'
"they're ignorant hypocrites with no actual values or morals. they wont care. god forgives people they like and he's asked for forgiveness. fuck everyone else who has an abortion though."
'It does lie: Broidy _did_ pay the $1.6 million.  The only thing where there  is uncertainty, is _why_ he paid it. It is not unlikely at all that it was a bribe for Trump, so Trump could pay ithat amount without ever touching the money.\n\n'
'Stupid is what stupid does, right?'
"He actually isn't, and people are downvoting him because of his name. He is saying that Broidy had a vasectomy in 2010. You know, the guy tied to the alleged affair and payoff. Since he had a vasectomy it would be difficult for Broidy to get someone pregnant but since Trump has never had one he is probably the guilty party."
'The Fear. I see the Fear. \n\nGood. '
'What the fuck? So the Cohen lawyer team do get to see and review which of the raided material is attorney client privilege? Thats basically allowing criminals to choose what evidence is used against them. Am i missing something or did the judge just ruled in favor of Cohen and trump team? '
'Me earlier in the day: One more indictment. Meh\n\nMe after watching Rachel Maddow: Holy shit! This is big!'
'This woman is an Americanophile who started a political organization to bring 2nd amendment style gun rights to Russia. In this, she was opposed by Putin. Her "handler" is some guy (a long-time friend) who works for the Russian central bank and their "clandestine" communications all happened on Twitter. \n\nEDIT: Seriously, [read the indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1080766/download) and see for yourselves what an evil joke this is.'
"okay, but how about a source for her being arrested and the rest of your post's title???"
'No the issue is HRC accepting illegal donations from Russia and some bullshit story about the NRA to distract from that. '
"Jim Jones' people killed a Congressman. \n\nLet's see what Trump's people do toward the end game..."
'The enemy of my enemy is my friend - as long as he continues to troll and poke liberals in the eye, they will support him. They hate the left, it’s really that simple. '
'What the hell could Andre possibly be looking at in the source gif? What could scare the most physically intimidating man to walk the earth? '
'If they had enough to get a warrant for the raid, they already have a hell of a lot. That’s for sure.'
'Bank fraud, campaign finance violations, conspiracy, racketeering?\n\nYeah.'

'Theon Greyjoy is a character from the Game of Thrones novels/ TV show. \n\nTLDR: He starts off very cocky and self-assured, betrays his allies in war, gets too big for his boots, takes a castle, is himself betrayed and is captured.

'Yea especially the negative karma part catches a lot of bad trolls'
"The Republican party, as we know it is dead. Mark my words. This is the end to a party that once stood for putting America's interest first. That is no longer the case. They can lie to themselves and be in denial all they want, but right now every one of this fuckers is focused on what they can get while they're still there and nothing else.

'There’s a name of someone who was charged and plead guilty RIGHT IN THE TITLE.  And he’s only one of the four who have been charged.  \n\nIs there a 5 month delay in the news in Russia?  '
'why do you trumpets always push this kinda bullshit? it makes you look illiterate when you cant even see that atleast 4 people have been indicted and charged. its literally world news. '
'Lolz. 2 pleas and 2 charges. The trump tower meeting attendees are all in shit for sure (1 is looking forward to may). This has got to be slow because the team of lawyers will find any little mistake'
"because you're an idiot that thinks that the world operates on TV time lines. This inst tv, there are no montages, there is not cutting through the time line. This is reality. This is how a REAL investigation goes, and how long it takes. \n\n\nHave you bothered to stop and think about what a REAL investigation of this magnitude takes? Have you noticed that when they do plan on interviewing people, the dates are scheduled weeks, even months out?\n\n\nYou didnt think that having to do all those interviews months apart would have NO bearing on how fast we the public hear about the details behind the scenes? \n\n\nDo you really think a professional investigator is going to give away what he knows before hes done?\n\n\nThe problem here isnt how long its taking, its how ignorant and ridiculous and naive your expectations are.\nWelcome to the real world, Kid Its nothing like TV, so stop insisting it should be."
'Fuor charged. Two under house arrest, two pleading guilty.  Those alternative facts are not working for you.'
'Uh, George Papadopoulos? You know he\'s been charged, right?\n\n\n"DOH!"\n\n-You\n\n\nEdit: That\'s right, you disingenuous prick. Move those goalposts! \n'
'Because we need proof and facts to charge somebody, something this whole Russia investigation has failed to submit after millions of dollars wasted.\n\nAll they have is accusations and charges a few wrong dates etc... thus purgery... therefore discredditing their own witnesses as liars. No prosecuter would touch that as a reliable witness. How lame does a lawyer have to be to discredit his Witnesses as a proven liar from the get-go... SMH\n\n#ReleaseTheMemo and say buh-bye to Meuller'
'Because for every 10 of us who see them as obvious manipulative liars with no sense of dignity or self-image, there is always an 11th moron ready to believe their lies'
"Anyone standing by Trump is a failure and a coward.  They just didn't realize the deal would go south, which is shocking given we've seen so many people who stood by him torched again and again."
'I know your comment is common knowledge, or it should be, but every time I read it a twinge of anxiety rolls through me. I can’t stop thinking about what’s going to happen when/if trump is impeached and loads of his people go to jail. What if his family members and closest advisors all go to jail? \n\n\nLook at it from the perspective of your average the_donald user. They will fully believe the man they think was here to save them was just falsely impeached from office and his family thrown in jail via a massive conspiracy. Turn the tables around and imagine Bernie was elected and he went to work exposing big money in politics and pushing legislation through to cripple their monopoly of influence. In retaliation the big money players perpetrated a conspiracy to frame him and had the media lie to the country. Then they impeached Bernie and sent his staff to jail. \n\n\nHow would we react to that? Is it really a stretch to think there would be millions upon millions in the streets ready for bloody revolution? I don’t think so at all. This is how those trump fans view the current state of politics. When trump is impeached this country could easily be thrown into complete chaos. I’m truly worried about how much blood could flow in the streets. That above comment illustrates so well the type of ideological person that will be highly susceptible to respond in this way. Fuck. '
"They're like shit pan handlers. Every now and then one of them finds a nugget of shit and they all crow and skip over to t_d to see if it's worth anything to their shitmaster.\n\nThey struck shit in 2016 and now they're just hoping for that mythical shitlode. \n\nBut the seam is spent."
'No seriously... how do they resolve the fact that Flynn and Papadapolous have thrown their careers away by pleading guilty to a federal felony over a hoax? What fucking dragon powers must Mueller possess to make grown men with families just say "screw it, i\'ll help you frame my buddy Donald".\n\nI reeeeeally want to know. '
"Indictments for lying about dates, one hell of a lawyer there discrediting his only Witnesses has proven Liars... Yeah that'll work in court. The FBI corruption has just buried your investigation... tbh Mueller would have been a good choice if he would have been investigating Russian interference and not just baseless collusion on Trump's end, but picking up a bunch of Clinton lawyers and Trump haters killed The credibility of the whole investigation. But the FBI end doj interference and collusion, that's going to roll. That's going to be fun to watch, cheers"
"For lying about the contents of conversations with Russians, and whether the conversations were coordinated with campaign higher-ups.  Read [the confession, particularly point c on page 2.](https://www.justice.gov/file/1015126/download).\n\n> The FBI corruption has just buried your investigation\n\nEvidence is evidence, even if tainted by ethical violations by the cop.  \n\nLook at it this way: OJ Simpson was put on a trial for murder, even though detective Mark Fuhrman had made racist remarks.    Fuhrman's behavior  was not a get-out-jail card for OJ.\n\nOr Ken Starr investigated Clinton for 6 years, even though he was a partisan Republican, and regularly leaked.  Starr got Clinton impeached (but not convicted by Senate).\n\nThen again, Russian bots might not know about the OJ trial, or Whitewater."
"I can't wait until this is all done and over with so idiots on social media can stop saying shit like this.\n\nEither there's evidence it happened or there isnt, and if it did happen, we aren't going to see ANY actual evidence of it until Mueller and his team decide to drop the hammer. Then it'll all come flooding the fuck out.\n\nAnd if there isn't evidence, then Mueller will get everyone he can for lying, and then have a press conference or some kind of court appearance where he will say so."
"> Is collusion a crime?\n\nCollusion is a superset of conspiracy.    Yes, there are forms of collusion that are not crimes.  But, for example, colluding/conspiring to leak stolen computer files is probably a cyber-crime.  Accepting or coordinating services (social media campaigns) from a foreign government to benefit a campaign is campaign finance violation.   Offering diplomatic quid-pro-quos (sanctions reductions) is a crime.    Any illegal acts (money laundering) uncovered during an investigation are also crimes (remember Whitewater?).  \n\nLying to an investigator about anything that isn't a crime is a crime (remember Monica Lewinsky?)\n\n> Then why do you have a criminal investigation?\n\nBecause of the potential illegal forms of collusion outlined above.\n\n>  I went to your house without probable cause and started digging through everything for a year, I'd find something.\n\nTough cookies.  Tell that to Bill Clinton and Whitewater.  Tell that to Hillary and Email-Gate.  That's why you keep your house squeaky clean if you go into politics.\n\n\n\n\n"
"If you're colluding to, say, steal someone's emails, then you've committed a crime. Criminal charges could range anywhere from conspiracy to wire fraud or more, depending on specifics. \n\nBut you don't need a crime to start an FBI counter-intelligence investigation, which is what the Trump Russia investigation started as. You just need someone like George Papadapolous to mouth off to an Australian diplomat about Russian emails. It was only because Trump fired Comey (lol) that Mueller was appointed with special counsel powers by the ~~deputy FBI director~~ assistant AG. In other words, Trump is an idiot--he brought this on himself. \n\nFunny thing is... your analogy basically describes (trigger warning) the Clinton special counsel investigation. Ken Starr was appointed by a Republican Congress (unlike Mueller) with the mandate to investigate a real estate deal in Arkansas, years before Clinton was President. It took 3000 days to finally nail Clinton for lying about a blowjob in the Oval Office decades later. Starr who, according to you, should have focused only on the land deal, had separate departments for the Lewinsky affair. There is your witch hunt."
"Here's an article about one of the quotes (which in the image is attributed to Don Jr but should have been attributed to Eric, as others in the thread have pointed out):\nhttp://www.wbur.org/onlyagame/2017/05/05/james-dodson-donald-trump-golf\nIt happened back in August 2013 during a conversation with golf writer James Dodson. There is no recording of the conversation, so we have to take Dodson's word for it. Eric Trump denied he said any of it. \nI believe Dodson but I thought everyone should know the full details."
"Really unfortunate this wasn't recorded. But considering how specific these quotes are, it would be very hard for them to claim that it was taken out of context. That whole family needs to be branded for the traitors they are."
'Well turns out the quotes are reversed which will just be used to discredit it. I understand that may not matter much to most of us here but it’s important to be factual. All the other side would have to say is it’s wrong, it’s fake news they never said that. '

'Please put Farage in prison, that would make my life. I want that smug bastard in prison more than Trump. '
'Exactly this.    \n\nAnd curious that the orange idiot has no insulting nic name for Avenatti, makes you wonder.'
'Except when they do. Here, you don’t need to know the answer for the strategy to work. You just need to point out a suspicious looking event and set off speculation that the Trump camp can’t refute. \n\nThink how well this one worked: “Why won’t he release the long-form birth certificate? What’s he hiding?” The answer was nothing. But it was still enough to get some Cheeto-looking motherfucker elected president.'
'Don’t forget QHG Cayman LTD - the Cayman Islands shell company that benefitted from the Rosneft sale. Putin and Rosneft sought to hide QHG’s involvement in the deal, but Reuters caught it early: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-rosneft-privatisation-insight/how-russia-sold-its-oil-jewel-without-saying-who-bought-it-idUSKBN1582OH\n\nIf QHG is connected to Trump in any way (children, Cohen, Manafort, Flynn, Kushner, etc.), then we have a conspiracy to commit racketeering, money laundering, bribery, and, depending on who you ask, treason. Trump and his team would be accused of promising to lift sanctions, which have stopped Rosneft from selling its stake, in exchange for hundreds of millions in the deal after it happened. It’s a clear quid pro quo. And that’s not to mention the legal ramifications for making that exchange part of helping him win an election, or the fact that the exchange was in direct violation of US law (sanctions). All that is an added weight to the possible violations of laundering, tax fraud, racketeering, etc. \n\nStory so crazy we have to remember to connect the dots!'

'Avenatti and Sam Numbers were both on MSNBC one night and Avenatti very politely asked Sam a question in a very kind tone of voice.

'WHAT THE FUCK WAS THE QUESTION?!?!'
"I laughed at trump saying the Russia investigation was destroying lives. That's what happens when you are on the wrong side of the law, fuckface. You knew what you were signing up for."
'Damn Eric is ugly! '

'She’s fucked them both'
"From the [original NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/19/us/politics/trump-jr-saudi-uae-nader-prince-zamel.html):\n\n>It is illegal for foreign governments or individuals to be involved in American elections, and it is unclear what — if any — direct assistance Saudi Arabia and the Emirates may have provided. But two people familiar with the meetings said that **Trump campaign officials did not appear bothered by the idea of cooperation with foreigners.**\n\nThis will be the story of the demise of this presidency, and possibly Trump Org as well. It's laws about money laundering, bribery, corruption, campaign finance, elections: he thinks everyone breaks them routinely, so he'd be a sucker to give them a second thought. \n\nWhen he was a private citizen, he got away with it. We don't have the resources to prosecute them, so they are de-facto legal. When you're the president, suddenly your behavior goes under a microscope, and the jig is up."
">Countries other than Russia may have offered assistance to the Trump campaign.\n\nFinally, a president willing to stand up to the globalists.  Could the projection get any more pathetic?  At what point are they going to blame Democrats for them voting for Trump?  Because at this point it's inevitable.  These people don't just lack a conscience.  They lack shame as well."
"Unstable genius. Whoopsie. Trump has heard that Trump did something bad. Does the fact he refers to himself like that not signal that he's as cuckoo as hell ? Hello ? \n"
"They already are blaming the Democrat/deep state conspiracy for the Trump campaign's collusion w Russia."
'"Someone pointed out that I said something racist, so I voted for a racist as revenge." '
'"Argh! How **dare** you call **me** racist! I am the **least** racist person you will ever meet, you stupid n-----!"'
'Multiple important things to take away.  \n\nNumber 1 this was done by OPR which is not part of the FBI but rather the DOJ WHICH is under Sessions.  \n2 McCabe believes he was targeted and smeared to loss credibility as a witness in Mueller s probe\n\nThis is incredibly petty to fire the man 18 months after the incident at 10 pm 2 days prior to his retirement. '
"I'm just glad they fired him instead of strangling him or poisoning him with either a nerve gas or polonium laced tea. "
"Or, maybe (maybe), he just sucked at his job? I don't know. I mean, getting cash for his wife's political career or ignoring clearly broken laws by a 'former candidate who shall not be named' or failing to followup on rules that were bent, broken or dismissed altogether because said law breaker had the same political leanings. No. Probably not. It must have been because he knows something about the Russians. Or, he could just be a douche nozzle that nobody liked. So hard to make sense of this. "
'Sessions bears a lot of the responsibility for this. Then again maybe his job was threatened if he didn’t fire him.  '
'FAKE NEWS: OPR (Office of Professional Responsibility) is part of the FBI, OPR is basically the FBI’s own internal affairs. But, yes if you are part of the FBI you are under the DOJ, there’s no hidng that one!\n\nYou also failed to mention the findings of the Obama appointed OIG inspector.'
'INAL, but would he really have a case? I know what the administration did was shitty and i am no trump fan. But what could McCabe sue for?'
"Dude, Trump didn't fire him. It is a little ridiculous getting down votes for stating something that is clearly fact based. Don't just ignore McCabe's nonsense because you dislike Trump. The guy was fired based on the findings of the Congressional Committee which had nothing to do with Trump. "
"I mean, clearly the AG or FBI Director could fire McCabe at any time.  The President has lambasted McCabe MANY times on Twitter.  At least in the eyes of the POTUS, there was ample reason to fire the guy months ago.  I just don't see why it had to wait until a politicized report was released by the HIC to do it.  The actions taken by Sessions and the White House just scream vindictiveness.  And now because of this, McCabe will sue the government for wrongful termination, costing taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more in legal fees.  From what I understand, McCain will eventually get a pension, but it won't be for another 10 years, and it's only ~$60k a year.  That's $600k in lost income for him.  How much will the federal government have to spend in legal fees defending their actions on firing him? "
'The publicly available document? \n\nWhoever fired him (not Trump according to you) had sufficient security clearance to access the House Intel findings long before the sanitized report became available.\n\nSo #logic: this guy is a major fraud, totally compromised, a disservice to the country, a black mark on the agency, a fool, a traitor...\n\nand we’ll hang on to him for awhile longer?'
'The House Intelligence Committee took a vote on whether to read the actual documents on which they claimed to base their “report.” Democrats voted for reading the documents. Republican majority voted against — the majority’s failure to read the underlying documents meant they knew nothing of the subject matter of their “report.” The screed that the Republican majority provided was basically a list of vague resentments based on lies, written by a moron who has no idea what he’s doing, besides carrying Trump’s jockstrap.  Google is your friend, too.'
'And? Does this in any way mean Trump fired McCabe? No, or doesn’t. '
"Here's what it means: you have no idea what you are talking about, but you're willing to make shit up so you can pretend that you do."
'The tweet i saw was along the lines of,\n\n"Only a few members of the eagles arrived so we\'ve decided to cancel the event"\n\nThen a few hours later he went on another rant about how kneeling for the anthem is un-american and how staying in the locker room instead of kneeling is worse blah blah.'
"Yes, and I agree it's incorrect. An error like that could have even gotten by a quick and careless proofread. \n\nBut these are hyperpartisan times in which even grammatical pedantry  will be perceived as a weapon in the war of ideas."
'Come on Mueller. Find dirt on this corrupt fuck. I genuinely believe Nunes is worse for America than Trump. He is not loyal to the law of the constitution. '
'Nunes is guilty as fuck. '
'Damn I got really confused because I was using the new Reddit UI and apparently quotes just don\'t show at all so I just saw "SIDE BAR:"'
'Yep. He and Trump are the two who are truly terrified, and not in a financial crimes way. An existential threat way. \n\nIt’s kids. They’re both on tape with kids.'
'Same. And all I did was say Donald Rumsfeld should crawl back into whatever hole he came out of, fuck off, and die. Not sure what the problem is.'
'There was an article about Mueller getting 70 blank subpoenas for the Manafort case, a commenter said "Holy cow that seems like a ton of subpoenas." and I replied "Going to need at least 3 high capacity magazines." (I\'m pro-gun control, but even I know a high capacity magazine holds 30, so you\'d need 3 magazines, in my absurd joke, to hold 70 subpoenas).\n\nDays after I made the comment, a moderator of the sub with a stick up his ass and no sense of humor said that I made a "cut and dry" death threat.  \n  \nI tried to include a link to my comment, but apparently this sub doesn\'t allow links.'
'There are dozens of us! Some Trumpbot was parroting talking points because I showed my confusion regarding how the hell does a population not want free healthcare for all.

'How long are you going to spam this thread because people are using Reddit in a way you don\'t like?\n\nSeeing as you\'ve been banned from "every major sub" by your own admission, I guess forever?'
"I'm not a fan of partisan memes. I only wanna see criminal politicians be punished PUBLICLY and Jailed.  I can't stand the tribalism.

'No, it doesn’t.\n\nI hate Trump as much as any other, but Clinton is not innocent. Just because one of Trump’s cronies is arrested or whatever does not equate to the opposite party member’s innocence.'

'There are court dates already on the docket next Wednesday and Thursday so the plea deal could be made public as soon as the 21st and more indictments could drop on Manafort as soon as the 23rd.

'Manafort is a big fish but not the one Mueller really wants. Being the chairman of Trump’s campaign put him in a unique position to see **everything** that happened during the campaign. Manafort is going to prison that’s for sure but Mueller will and likely has offered him a lifeline keeping him from serving the rest of his life in prison. '
"They're not saying the sarcastic jokey parts I put like all of Trump's advisers being being somehow employed by Hillary Clinton, but they are saying the first 2 sentences.  When they post here, they post something similar to that too.  They've got posts up right now saying Mueller is somehow working on the Uranium One deal and going after Clinton.  I don't have the strength to make this shit up anymore."

"At best, McConnell ignored Obama's good-faith request for cooperation on fighting Russian election interference out of political posturing or personal animus for the President.\n\nAt worst, McConnell was complicit (actively or permissively) in a Russian conspiracy to achieve power for his party. \n\nIf the former is as deep as this rabbit hole goes, McConnell and the rest of the part leadership still must be removed from the levers of power post haste. If it's the latter, they deserve to rot in prison."

'Collecting the evidence is probably fairly quick. Getting them into a room, comfortably, where they lie about their crimes and evidence takes time.\n\nIt\'s a lot more slam dunk when you have them lying. if you force the issue they will say "Yes, I did that. Was it a crime? I had no intent"\n\nYou get them to lie, and then they can not claim to have not intent. They knew what they did was wrong, the evidence proves what they did, and the lie proves the intent. '

If Trump had a clue, he'd have resigned by now and fled the country. Then again, if Trump had a clue, he wouldn't be Trump."
"The court has jurisdiction on the ones in this country and can request extradition on those in countries with whom we have treaties. As for any of the indicted that may be in Russia.. forget it, Russia doesn't extradite its citizens (though, if things head too far south, I wouldn't be surprised to see them come down with a severe case of polonium)."
"Take a look at that timeline again. 4-8 years isn't an option in this case. The POTUS himself is likely guilty of high crimes. If we wait until he's out of office to indict him, he will have stolen an entire term, rather than the 14 months he's already stolen.\n\nThe system moves to damn slowly for this kind of attack."
"Our country has been barreling through problem after problem, issue after issue, scandal after scandal for almost three years now, starting with the election campaigns. I think we can all be a little sympathetic for people to want this all to be over and done with. We've been constantly been fed information about Russian interference since the election, day in an day out. It feels like forever for many with how much some of us are plugged into the news. I think that we can all empathize with that feeling."
"It's bullshit! I did not grab her in the pussy, I did not! "
'The system wasn\'t designed to withstand this kind of attack. The US needs to get its collective brain out of its collective butt and open the Constitution for amendment. We\'re naked as we are now and with the Internet, everyone just knows it, we know it, "they" know it, plus we\'re obviously too stupid as a group to navigate with an old Constitution so we need to edit.'
"I'd rather not care too much about individuals being exhausted as long as there's some consistency to the machine.\n\nNot long ago there were complaints of everything being slow, now those are immediately forgotten when convenient. That's overall behavior I expect from T_D, not here."
"I think he could indict on Obstructing right now, and when he inevitably does, Obstruction will be one of the charges, but I think he's still putting together the pieces on a rico conspiracy case and even at the current breakneck pace, I don't expect that he'd have the authority to bring that against a sitting PotUS until early next year.  Obviously, when that day does come, also expect election fraud and a long list of money laundering charges."
"Trump could only go where AF1 would take him if it was cleared through channels.  Presumably, DOD channels since it's the Air Force.  If he (or anyone) wanted to flee and there was an unsealed indictment against him, I doubt he could get out of the country.  We don't own our passports, you know.  And Trump (and any president, really) is more of a prisoner than he knows."
"I think you're just going to have to come to grips that though we are part of the same community, we're still different people with different viewpoints. *I know* that law is a slow and methodical process because without double jeopardy, investigations need to be as clear as they can possible be. Other people might not know that. They might even think that there's nothing else to discover, that Trump is obviously guilty, and he needs to be fast tracked to a prison cell. \n\nNot all of us have the same level of understanding and patience. Personally, I can really empathize with people being impatient about getting Trump out of office. He hasn't been the greatest for our country (I probably didn't need to say that on this subreddit)."
"I do not support trump whatsoever.  I am cautioning that financial motives chip away at his credibility.  If he had no financial stake in this and didn't tweet so much, it'd be pretty hard to find a reason to claim he lies.  I happen to believe him, but the potential argument for his impartiality exists and it should be acknowledged.  Don't be a sheep and assume you're obviously right because you want to be "
'Don’t make me feel insecure. Haven’t you learned that there are no dumb questions! '
"Trying to compare Comey's actions to Trump's actions by saying that Comey is potentially taking advantage of sensationalism to make money off of his experiences with Trump is ridiculous. People who experience high-profile events, such as the U.S. presidency, or being involved in a large political scandal, write books about their experiences frequently. This is certainly not out of the ordinary, whatsoever. \n\nThis is especially highlighted when compared to the ridiculous sensationalism and profiteering of Donald Trump. Comey looks like a saint in comparison. Writing a book about your experiences in American politics and tweeting criticism about a highly controversial president is not a reason to doubt his credibility. Donald Trump and his style of politics are a huge threat to our country. Comey realizes this and is trying to do his part by calling Trump out when he makes mistakes. "

"Trump is a [Trubbish](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Trubbish_\\(Pok%C3%A9mon\\)), that worthless Pokemon who is just a pile of trash. \n\n>Trubbish resembles a full, dark green garbage bag that with a knot at the top that acts like ears. Trubbish has oval-shaped eyes and large triangular teeth that resemble broken glass. Its arms that look like trash spilling out of small tears in the bag with pink and blue objects protruding out of them. Its feet are dark green and stubby.\nThis Pokémon was created when a mixture of domestic and industrial waste underwent a chemical reaction of some sort. Trubbish emits noxious, burp-like gases which, when inhaled, will render the victim bedridden for a week. As evidenced in the anime, Trubbish's ear-like tufts stand straight up when startled, are lifted if happy, and lowered if it is feeling down. Furthermore, in the same episode, it is also explained that once Trubbish befriends a person, it will cease expelling foul odors. It prefers unsanitary places, such as garbage dumps"
'It’s total bullshit. \n\nImpeachment is in the Constitution. No one is above the law. All civil officers can be impeached and removed from office by the Senate. Anyone who argues otherwise is a moron or a criminal. \n\nI repeat, moron or a criminal. '
"Just to be clear:\n\n1. Kavanaugh said that it *is not* currently the law that the president is exempt from criminal investigation/prosecution/questioning, and that Congressional action would be necessary to change that. It would be very hard for a justice who said that to later find such an exemption without congressional action.\n\n\n2. Impeachment is completely separate from criminal prosecution, which the constitution says come *after* impeachment. I would very much like to see 45 prosecuted, but Kavanaugh (and the constitution) have a point here: in theory, you need your president to be presidenting, and a criminal prosecution is distracting. The answer isn't supposed to be that he gets off, the answer is supposed to be that he gets impeached at the first whiff of criminality. Obviously, McConnel and Ryan have fucked this up, but the principle makes sense to me."
'That would make him above the law. Commit murder one year into your term? Congress won’t impeach because the investigation is “tainted”? Get re-elected ang go 7 years without standing trial for murder. That’s what being above the law looks like. '
'>I do find it amusing that he wrote that essentially defending Clinton. Saying that investigation distracted him from running the country.\nAnd some are taking it as him being a trump supporter/defender.  That’s not really the case at all.\n\nNo. He wrote that in 2009, after Bush and Cheney have been subject to controversy. Contrary his subsequent call for the exemption of the president in criminal investigations, he was in a lead role in Starr’s Clinton probe, and took an aggressive approach in investigating him. He also spearheaded the investigation into Vince Foster’s suicide and its connection to Clintons, which was basically the Seth Rich conspiracy theory of the 1990s. He drafted the Starr report, though he objected to the release of some sexual details.\n\n> kavanuagh is a moderate,\n\nJust no.'
"I understand the concern but his track record shows a record of using a lot of case law.  Now him being up for this position is also a bit scandalous.  It's coming out that Kennedy would only retire if he was given the job.  This whole thing is fucked.    This seat should have been the previous administrations at least one of them.  However I do believe that all political and personal bias do not belong in courts conservative or liberal which is why it only being 51 for appointment is bad now.\n\nI think he could've gotten the job on the old standard but this is now super political and ramifications towards a constitutional crisis.    not be allowed to appoint and the McConnell rule should be in affect since we are so close to midterms which if the democrats were smart would sue over this because it essentially became law after 2016."
'There is an investigation during an impeachment trial. For the sake of argument if  a POTUS was going through the impeachment trial for criminal misconduct wouldn\'t that count as a "criminal investigation"? I think the term "criminal investigation" needs to be defined.  Given that the term isn\'t well defined by this nominee (from what I\'ve seen posted here), I\'m not sure how you find this sensical. '
"Um, no dude. Kavanaugh is not saying the president cannot be impeached. No one with any knowledge of separation of powers jurisprudence would make that argument. He's saying the president is immune to criminal indictments while in office - which is not, for the record, a new or radical idea."
'“An impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.” Gerald Ford.\n\nThe Constitution specifies two crimes, treason & bribery, by name but also leaves room for a much broader interpretation — one that’s been used before to impeach other elected members with “charges” of abuse of power (which in & of itself is not a crime, legally speaking) or champerty, which is almost like sportsmanship during trial. A judge in the late 1800’s (Mark Delahay) was even impeached because of drunkenness. Now I highly doubt a congress would ever impeach a president over any of these, but going back to Ford’s statement - impeachment is political, it’s not judicial. If Congress wants to lodge charges of impeachment against a sitting president, theoretically it could be about anything.'
'That\'s exactly why his position is strange. He wanted to be aggressive in investigating Clinton to the point that Ken Starr rejected some of his proposed questions (he also injected some of his personal opinions on Clinton\'s behavior in his letter to Starr, which Republicans will all be howling and whining about if Mueller\'s team or anyone involved in Trump\'s legal troubles did so on Trump) yet ten years later, he thinks such aggressive approach distracts the president from carrying out his job to the fullest of his abilities and is therefore bad. Either, over the decade, he experienced a massive change in his views "with no political bias involved" or he had been worried about possible probe into Bush/Cheney as he worked for Bush. \n\nAnd about being moderate: he is more right-wing than Kennedy and Roberts, so that should be a dealbreaker as to why he is no friend to liberals.'
'I agree with the thought, but then there is this:\n\nKavanaugh wrote in an article for the Minnesota Law Review from 2009 that Congress should pass a law “exempting a President—while in office—from criminal prosecution and investigation, including from questioning by criminal prosecutors or defense counsel.”\n\n“I believe that the President should be excused from some of the burdens of ordinary citizenship while serving in office,” Kavanaugh wrote. “We should not burden a sitting President with civil suits, criminal investigations, or criminal prosecutions.” Furthermore, Kavanaugh opined that the “indictment and trial of a sitting President” would “cripple the federal government.”\n\nSo, he’s not only immune from indictments - he’s immune from investigation. How can someone be impeached for misconduct if they cannot even be investigated for said misconduct? One begets the other. \n\nWhile you are right that he is literally saying “indictment not impeachment” should be illegal, you’re kidding yourself if you think this doesn’t have the same effect. \n\nHe chose Kavanaugh to protect him from the investigation, full stop. This is a very great risk that could shut down Mueller. '
"I think the concern here, at least for me, is that this nominee seems to be concerned with the preservation of the executive powers at all costs, even in the face of grave criminal misconduct. While I believe that a judge is suppose to render decisions based on precedence, traditional practice, and the facts, we have seen other SCOTUS' rule to the contrary, Neil Gorsuch, being the most recent in his vote to overturn decades of precedence in the recent Union ruling.  I think we also have to remember this current nominee worked in the Bush administration during the most controversial time when the executive was violating privacy and human rights laws (I'm of course simplifying here), but to my knowledge he was a staunch supporter of those aforementioned Bush policies which I too find troubling. "
'Read it again. *Criminal* investigation.\n\nEdit: for clarity, think of it this way - if you take the stance that the president is immune from criminal indictment, of course he is also immune from criminal investigation with an eye  toward indictment. What would be the point of a criminal investigation of an unindictable person?\n'
'He was doing his job... it wasent his job to only investigate a little bit because his personal opinion was “this is distracting the president”.  Wouldn’t you be upset if Mueller did that now? “I’m distracting trump so I won’t push the investigation”?\n\nTbh, I have no respect at all for them to just oppose everything because trump did it.  Same as I think it was absolutely disgraceful when congress refused to even consider any justice Obama nominated.   These things should be done properly, on a one by one basis, based on the nominated persons credentials.  Not by party line bullshit. \n\nThis is why we have a dysfunctional government. And it’s just as incredibly irritating when the dems do it. '

'Here you go.\n\n*1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism*\nDJT:  While we don’t have Swastikas everywhere we look, we can look almost anywhere and see one specific slogan: Make America Great Again. This slogan that Trump created represents harmful beliefs.\n\nThis shows extreme nationalism and a want to unify people under a symbolic slogan.\n\nWe can see the slogan on hats, shirts, signs, and more apparel, and it’s only a way of spreading nationalistic beliefs and hate.\n\n\n*2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights*\n\nThere is absolutely no argument that this point doesn’t align with Trump. He has managed to convince many people that certain groups such as Muslims and Mexicans are enemies, and we need security against them. He’s convinced people that certain human rights aren’t necessary (such as basically any right that doesn’t directly help the white middle-class). Also, he convinces people that death penalties and longer incarcerations are okay and even needed. He literally fits into every part of number 2.\n\n*3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause*\n\nDJT:  "When Mexico is sending its people, they\'re not sending their best. They\'re bringing drugs. They\'re bringing crime. They\'re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."\n\nDJT:  "Islam hates us."\n\n\n*4. Supremacy of the Military*\n\nDJT:  Draft dodger who wants a military parade in his honor and talks about how big his nuclear button is....\n\n*5. Rampant Sexism*\n\nDJT:  I mean this one is a bit too easy between between “grab ‘em by the pussy”, saying he’d date his daughter if he weren’t related to her, banning funding or any programs that so much as mention abortion, looking down on and encouraging hate towards homosexuality, and many other instances of blatant sexism.  Then for fun throw in how about how he views others:\n"26,000 unreported sexual assaults in the military, and only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together.".....so rape is an eventuality when you put men and women together?!?!?\n\n*6. Controlled Mass Media*\n\nDJT:  Asserts that any negative news is fake news, wants press credentials pulled, wants limited access for press unless authorized, and controls a direct line of propaganda through Hanity and Fox.\n"The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC and @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!"\n\n*7. Obsession With National Security*\n\nDJT:  Fear has been Trump’s tactic since the start. By using the slogan “Make America Great Again” he’s convinced people that America must get better or horrible things will happen, as well as using a fear of minority groups to light fires under racists.\n"I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words."\nEssentially holds children being separated from their parents as a bargaining chip to get his wall built.  A wall that will curb only a small amount of illegal immigration and cost exorbitant amounts of money to build and maintain.\n\n*8. Religion and government are intertwined*\n\nDJT:  You have multiple cabinet members citing Bible verses as to why and how certain policies are enforced.  That is not what this country was founded on!\n"I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created."  \nHe outwardly claims that he’s a Christian, and has used religious beliefs in making his decisions and statements which carries a powerful following.  Which is sad since his actions, and statements are anything but Christian. \n\n*9. Corporate power is protected.*\n\nDJT:  It is all about money and greed.  As President he remains interwoven in private business interests and indeed profits from the Presidency.\nTrump being a business aristocrat, is what put him into office. He is the business/government relationship and he creates the power elite.\n\n*10. Labor power is suppressed.*\n\nDJT:  Haven\'t seen him specifically attack labor Unions as President but has a history of doing so in the private business world. \n\n*11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts*\n\nDJT:  "It is not \'freedom of the press\' when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want, even if it is completely false!"\nThen sue them for libel....oh that\'s right you would lose because a majority of what they are writing about you that upsets him so, is true.\nHe doesn\'t read books, he can\'t sit through briefings, doesn\'t prepare for meetings, and he is proud of that fact.......\n\n*12. Obsession With Crime and Punishment*\n\nDJT:  "If Chicago doesn\'t fix the horrible "carnage" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 42 percent from 2016), I will send in the feds!"\nFast to tweet about crimes that fit his cabinet optics and painfully silent or late to report those that don\'t. \n\n*13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption*\n\nDJT:  This needs its own post, but Mueller investigation, Cohen corruption and bribery, blatant abuse of his so called charity. \n\n*14. Fraudulent Elections*\n\nDJT:  Lies about vote tallies (when it is proven he lost the popular vote.  Lies about illegal voting numbers claiming it is in the millions when it is not even in the hundreds.

"Honestly, and this is just my random gut theory, I think the problem is numbers. We have too many people. We know at least 1 out of every 100 people is a sociopath. That would mean there are around 3.5 million sociopaths. Sociopaths would gravitate towards positions of power. With limited positions available I wouldn't be surprised if most of not all politicians are sociopaths as well as most CEOs. Even if a minority of those postions are filled with sociopaths it's damaging. \n\nThis is my unsubstantiated, really high right now gut theory. "

'The watergate investigation lasted twice as long and the bill clinton investigation lasted four times as long.

"Congratulations, you've correctly identified why this conspiracy is such a non-issue."
"You're arguing from ignorance here. Russia consumes about 9 million of pounds of uranium for it's energy every year. You can make a nuclear bomb with just 35 pounds of uranium. Meaning, Russia has absolutely no need for our uranium if it wanted to make nuclear weapons.\n\nNot only that, the United States imports about 25% of the uranium it consumes every year from Russia. We only domestically mine about 8% of the uranium we use. Russia is one of the largest producers of uranium worldwide. They have no need for our uranium to make nuclear weapons.\n\nThere really just is no scenario where this looks bad if you know enough about uranium production and imports."
"> She took a shitload of hear bc of that bs investigation.\n\nShe should have been charged with a misdemeanor and given probation, just like any other first-time offender would.\n\n> her political career is over\n\nMost criminals, even misdemeanants, suffer career-related consequences when they commit crimes. That is a normal consequence of breaking the law, even unintentionally. It sucks, but that is the way it is.\n\nHaving career consequences is not a sufficient replacement for criminal prosecution. Or, it wouldn't be for normal people like you or I.\n\n> One of the biggest factors her political career is over, and for what? For negligence.\n\nNo, sorry. It's not possible to accidentally install an email server in your home and conduct governmental business on it. Clinton intentionally had the server set up and she intentionally performed work as Secretary of State using her private email address.\n\nI think you're confusing negligence with ignorance of the law. I mean, it's very possible that she didn't realize her conduct was criminal. But, unfortunately, ignorance of the law is not an excuse.\n\nI practice criminal law, and I've had many clients who wrongly believed their actions were lawful. But that doesn't mean they avoided prosecution.\n\nI had one medicinal marijuana client, for example, who thought his medical marijuana prescription entitled him to possess several pounds of marijuana. His acts were purposeful, but his breaking of the law was accidental. He was still charged and convicted."
'My concerns with President Trump are primarily stylistic.\n\n1. **Norm-breaking.** His rejection of norms is dangerous. Most of our norms were adopted for good reasons and permit the system to function in a professional and non-corrupt manner.\n2. **Childishness.** His failure to conduct himself like an adult degrades his office and our standing in the world. Specifically, his name-calling of other people, his spitefulness, and his inability to let things go demonstrates extreme emotional development problem.\n3. **Racism.** His repeated dog-whistling to racists sets the country back decades. Like saying that a judge was unable to fairly oversee his case because the judge was Mexican. Or saying that some white supremacists are "very fine people."\n4. **Dishonesty.** His willingness to promulgate and defend completely unnecessary lies borders on mental illness. For example, claiming that President Obama was born in Kenya, that 5 million people voted illegally (and all of them voted for Clinton), that his crowd sizes were larger than President Obama\'s, or that President Obama was spying on him during the election. One of those lies actually lead to the formation of a commission whose primary goals appear to be: validating President Trump\'s lie, and suppressing the votes of minorities.\n5. **Amorality.** President Trump has no clear agenda, with a few exceptions. He appears to care more about "winning" than actually instituting specific policies. For example, during the campaign he promised universal health care on more than one occasion. He also promised to reduce the debt. Since taking office, he has supported bills that do exactly the opposite of those things. The recent budget he is celebrating actually increases the deficit.\n\nThese characteristics have lead to many problems. Most obviously:\n\n* His refusal to divest himself of his assets is my biggest concern. President Trump\'s assets should be in a blind trust, like Jimmy Carter\'s peanut farm, or sold off. I know it\'s inconvenient, but it\'s a reasonable cost of becoming the most powerful man in the world.\n\n* His pardon of Joe Arpaio was a severe degradation of the rule of law, as well as the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n* President Trump\'s threats to revoke the licenses of news organizations for airing stories he didn\'t like was, in my mind, a violation of the First Amendment. Even if no action was taken, using his position and office to threaten dissenters is egregious.\n\n* Undercutting his Secretary of State\'s negotiations with North Korea by stating: "[Rex Tillerson] is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man" was outrageous and dangerous. President Trump clearly lacks the capacity to understand the consequences of his actions. We *should* be trying diplomacy with North Korea, and the president should never publicly subvert his diplomats\' efforts.\n\n* Impulsively firing James Comey because he disliked the FBI\'s investigation of his campaign\'s ties to Russia. ("[W]hen I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said \'you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it\'s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won\'.")\n\nI hope this answers your question. I gave you five personality traits and five clear examples of dangerous conduct.'
'> Anybody who wants to charge Hillary with a misdemeanor and put her on probation is fuckin nuts.\n\nWhy? Here is what the statute says:\n\n> Whoever, being an officer, employee, contractor, or consultant of the United States, and, by virtue of his office, employment, position, or contract, becomes possessed of documents or materials containing classified information of the United States, knowingly removes such documents or materials without authority and with the intent to retain such documents or materials at an unauthorized location shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both. (18 U.S.C. 1924(a).)\n\nSo, the relevant elements are essentially:\n\n1. The person was an officer or an employee of the United States;\n2. The person, by virtue of his/her position, came into possession of documents or materials containing classified information;\n3. The person knowingly removed those documents or materials without authority; and\n4. When doing so, they had the intent to retain those documents or materials at an unauthorized location.\n\nComey stated that there were seven e-mail chains that concerned "matters that were classified at the Top Secret/Special Access Program level ***when they were sent and received***." ([Source](https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clinton2019s-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system), emphasis added.)\n\nSo, there is clearly sufficient evidence to say that Clinton sent and received classified information by virtue of her position as Secretary of State.\n\nAnd the U.S. State Department\'s inspector general stated: "Clinton never asked permission to set up the server and that use of private email to conduct state department business would not have been allowed if she had." ([Source](https://patch.com/district-columbia/washingtondc/state-department-criticizes-hillary-clinton-over-uses-private-email-server).)\n\nSo, there is clearly sufficient evidence to say that Clinton\'s storage of those classified documents or materials was at an unauthorized location.\n\nThe only question is what it means to "knowingly remove" those emails. And I think intentionally having them sent to a server at an unauthorized location would likely suffice if they issue were to be litigated.\n\nSo, why didn\'t Comey prosecute Clinton? According to him, he would only have brought a case if there was:\n\n* Clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information;\n* Vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct;\n* Indications of disloyalty to the United States; or\n* Efforts to obstruct justice.\n\nThe problem is that Comey is either: (1) adding new elements to the crime, or (2) requiring that the scale be larger than the present case. For example, there is no element that requires evidence of disloyalty to the United States.\n\nVery simply, Comey appears to have found that Clinton broke the law, but that a reasonable prosecutor would not have pursued the case because it wasn\'t that big of a deal. That is a terrible standard.\n\nThere are, in fact, small-scale cases where people brought small amounts of classified documents to their home and, despite the small scale, were nevertheless prosecuted. A normal person would have been prosecuted in Clinton\'s position.'
'You’re fuckin nuts, man. Hey I got an idea, let’s get a team of FBI agents to do round the clock surveillance, and see if we can’t catch her jaywalking or maybe a rolling stop. Ffs. Just outta curiosity, are you a bernie or bust asshole or a trashy trump traitor? Both groups bear the same irrational Clinton hate. '
"Like what? If she (or any of the nine cabinet members on the committee) had objected, the president could have stopped the deal. But there aren't any consequential implications either way.\n\nFirst, there is no shortage of uranium for Russia to purchase. In fact, we import more uranium from Russia than we mine domestically. https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=2150\n\nThey don't need *our* uranium. If anything, we need theirs. If Russia was in desperate need of uranium for some reason, it would simply stop selling to us.\n\nAnd the uranium produced by Uranium One's mines make up a very small portion of the total amount of uranium we consume. The United States imports about 55 million pounds of uranium every year, but we only produce around 4 million pounds.\n\nThis whole conspiracy is just so confusing. Russia consumes way more uranium every year for it's nuclear power plants than it could possibly need for nuclear weapons development.\n\nI mean, you can make a nuclear bomb with just 35 pounds of uranium. Yet Russia uses about 9 million of pounds of uranium for it's energy every year. Why would we be worried about them taking our uranium for nuclear weapons?"

"What are you expecting to find in his tax returns? Are you just hoping for any reason to impeach him because you have trump derangement syndrome? If Trump is a criminal, then the Clintons are demons!! Talking about grabbing a pu$$y doesn't compare to raping dozens of women and appointing judges in districts where you commit crimes to cover for you or flying on the lolita Express over 20 times with convicted Pedo Jeffrey Epstein and very obviously abusing underage girls. And no, the one girl you're thinking of that claimed that Trump sexually harassed her dropped the case. She admitted she was lying so she could get money from Trump to shut her up. Be objective about morality, not just looking for a reason to criminalize someone just because you don't like them. Atleast have a shred of evidence to believe he's criminal first! "
'It would be too much work to find it since the key words are so commonly used.\n\nAfter the election Trump ditches the media to have a family meal and the press lost their shit and condemned him for disrespecting the media and a lack of transparency and so on and so fourth.\n\nEdit: haha I found it.

"More bullshit. No, there's no law he's violating, but he is violating 1) 40 years of unanimous precedent, and 2) his own repeated promises. All for seemingly no reason, if he really has nothing to hide."
'Now fox and foes are retreating back to "Trump may have committed some minor crimes, but that\'s all ok because it\'s just part of aggressive entrepreneurship" and "the fbi is just threatening him and making confess to something he didn\'t do".  Do you remember a few months ago (some still repeat this) when trumpites were defending the notion that trump didnt know papadapolous or etc... I think that the fbi is aware that if they indict everyone slow enough, the trumpites will eventually retreat to "ok, he might be a puppet for putin and guilty of treason, but he did it out of the kindness of his heart, oh and the deep state and killary doesn\'t want you to...."

"Pal, you are in a sub full of shareblue shills. It's a dead end trying to argue with these political prostitutes."
"> currently, there's an issue where boys are performing much worse than girls in school\n\nMaybe they should stop being dumb?"
'>How do you know there isn\'t an institutional bias at play? How do you know the education system isn\'t structured in such a way that boys are disadvantaged? \n\nOkay. From my experience, girls typically keep grades consistent. Guys on the other hand, tend to procrastinate more. I know, it\'s an assumption, but just take my word for it. It\'s not really their fault. \n\nFor guys that care about their grades, typically they are probably going to miss homework and all that, but when it comes to tests, or an "imminent threat", we *get shit done*.  \n\nI\'m a guy. I do not consistently do my homework over a period of time. What I do is I binge it days before a huge test. Then I typically ace that test. \n\nI cannot speak for everyone, and I cannot say that what I do is mimicked by all male students, but what I can say is that it seems more likely that this is the case. \n\nDifferent attitudes and behaviours in students may be responsible for this, rather than an institutional bias against men. \n\n\nI\'ll now say something. [This](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/8191448) is the famous "1 in 5" survey of women sexually assaulted on campus, "debunked" by many guys on YouTube. Seriously, I\'ll save you a search. \n\nBefore you see this video, be aware of [cognitive dissonance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance). He may "attack" a web personality you\'re probably very familiar with. \n\n[Here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rc24YtUslCU).\n\nNow, if this survey is correct, how would you know that there isn\'t an institutional bias against victims of sexual assault? It is know that surveys like this have low turnout rates. \n\nNow, yes, male rape victims have a bigger social bias against them, but also understand that they are in the vast minority. That wouldn\'t make their voices matter less, they are as important, but this goes both ways. \n\nThe reason I mention this is because I don\'t want you to try and [redirect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism)   this argument to "Male rape victims have it harder". Is it possible that there is an "institutional bias" against *all* victims, regardless of gender? \n\nOr maybe it\'s just a bit more complicated than that? The survey is flawed, and does not paint a picture for *every woman in America*. But those are facts. \n\n>O, well by that logic, maybe women should work better, and they\'d earn more, amirite?\n\nIt\'s a bit more complicated. It is shown that women typically have a harder time negotiating higher pay- there are organizations that coach women to do so, along with probably a lot more factors. \n\n>Maybe women can stop being dumb and actually invent something, or win a nobel prize, etc\n\nGoddamn it. Maybe the reason why that\'s the case is because there are *less women on those fields.* *It wasn\'t like it was 50/50 back then, and men simply beat them like in a fair competition*. \n\nI apologize if this comes off as disorganized. There are claims that you seem to keep yourself in the more conservative subreddits. Please don\'t. I used to be like you, surrounding myself with YouTube channels like that. \n\nBut when I found challenging ideas that went against mine, that made me feel cognitive dissonance, I was aware of what I was feeling, and decided to listen. \n\nWhen I saw that "1 in 5" statistic, I just simply tried to ignore it, saying it was no more than 2% according to some dude I heard. I tried finding people to really debunk it, but all I found, was people simply dismissing it, or pointing out that Obama and Biden said it wrong, or pointing to a survey that says otherwise, when really that survey cites the *very* survey I didn\'t like. \n\nThat survey is flawed, but not false. \n\n'
'**Cognitive dissonance**\n\nIn the field of psychology, cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort (psychological stress) experienced by a person who simultaneously holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values. The occurrence of cognitive dissonance is a consequence of a person\'s performing an action that contradicts personal beliefs, ideals, and values; and also occurs when confronted with new information that contradicts said beliefs, ideals, and values.\n\nIn A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance (1957), Leon Festinger proposed that human beings strive for internal psychological consistency in order to mentally function in the real world. A person who experiences internal inconsistency tends to become psychologically uncomfortable and is motivated to reduce the cognitive dissonance.\n\n***\n\n**Whataboutism**\n\nWhataboutism (also known as whataboutery) is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent\'s position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument,  which is particularly associated with Soviet and Russian propaganda. When criticisms were leveled at the Soviet Union, the Soviet response would be "What about..." followed by an event in the Western world.\n\nThe term "whataboutery" has been used in British English since the period of The Troubles conflict in Northern Ireland. Lexicographers date the first appearance of the variant whataboutism to the 1990s, while other historians state that during the Cold War Western officials referred to the Soviet propaganda strategy by that term.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

'Absolutely. No one, no president especially, is immune or exempt from criticism. I had beefs with Obama, and I voiced them openly while he was president.

To me, “no collusion” is just shorthand for, “I’ve done a bunch of illegal and unethical shit that I’m trying to hide, but you won’t get me on this collusion thing.” '
'Yeah, as we come to learn more about the facts of what happened, a time will come when the media will need to substitute "conspiracy" for "collusion." Collusion is a broad term that essentially refers to under the table communications to achieve certain goals, in bad faith. Conspiracy is a crime, but the important thing is that it goes along with other crimes. E.g. Conspiracy to commit murder is a crime which exists apart from the actual crime of murder. Colluding with a foreign government to win an election could be a broad description for any number of acts which may have taken place, most or all of which would be illegal.\n\nBut until we know what *exactly* are the laws he is alleged to have broken, I think the shorthand "collusion" is probably better for everyday discussion than "conspiracy," without identifying the attendant crime.'

"The best part of it is that compared to the cover ups, Nixon's crime wasn't that big. He went from 'merely' doing illegal stuffs to fight oppositions to actually endangered constitution to protect himself. Same with Bill, who got impeached for lying under oath about...consensual blow job.\n\nTrump's initial crimes, when revealed, are going to be even worse than the cover ups."

Shit comments warrant shit responses."
"Yeah, caring that the top of the FBI is lying to attack a president is totally not normal.  Only people that really really want Trump to be guilty don't see this as a total disaster for the FBI.  One of those cocksuckers lied and will be indicted for it.  I'm sorry you are upset by the truth and not bothered by partisan hackery at the top levels of the FBI. "
"Jesus Christ how horrifying.\n\nI hate to break this to you, but November 2016 was one of the biggest disasters progressives have suffered in years. If Hillary had won, we could have talked about a progressive Speaker of the House, but in this timeline, we're stuck playing defense."
'> to Horowitz. “Lacking candor” means lying.\n\nno, it doesn\'t. \n\n"lacking candor" is not equivalent to "lying". at all. the whole issue is that apparently mccabe didn\'t sufficiently expand on his statements.\n\n> Trump had nothing to do with it.\n\nthat\'s a lie. \n\n> Don’t worry. The Big Ugly is near. \n\nof course you are very concerned about "candor", while trump and his cronies shamelessly lie _every day_. wtf.'
">Yeah, caring that the top of the FBI is lying to attack a president is totally not normal. \n\nNoone did this. And you're very obviously just looking to spew trump propaganda.\n\n>Only people that really really want Trump to be guilty don't see this as a total disaster for the FBI.  \n\nLol no, only trumpettes suck down this trumpian/Russian propaganda this hard.\n\n>One of those cocksuckers lied and will be indicted for it.\n\nYes, Trump and his supporters.\n\n> I'm sorry you are upset by the truth \n\nThe irony lmao.\n\n>and not bothered by partisan hackery at the top levels of the FBI. \n\nAh yes totally partisan hackery....from folks of the same party..."
'Fake Contributions!!!!!  \n\nTime for the orange idiot to go.'
">So many people now no longer argue their point in good faith which kills any chance of meaningful dialogue.\n\nI'm not sure I follow what you mean with that. I'm confused if you are discussing the method of the arguement, or do you mean people are miss representing their arguments or did I miss the point completely?? "
'so precise, but dishonest. Why?'
"I'd kill for an actual episode."
"Wow, this guy hates, *hates*, the concept of state secrets leaking into our enemies' hands.\n\nHe also talks here about how much he personally likes to put criminals behind bars.\n\nI cannot imagine that he thinks kindly of the many, many senior Trump officials- including, of course, [Trump himself](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-revealed-highly-classified-information-to-russian-foreign-minister-and-ambassador/2017/05/15/530c172a-3960-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html?utm_term=.ec6b770d38fb), who appear to be crazy guilty of this."
'So I watched the whole thing and was impressed with how relevant everything is today from this which was uploaded in 2009. Also found another of his speechs about [Cyberinsecurity: Crime and Terrorism in the Internet Age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEMYKDIdGkU). This speech was done Jan of 2016, Holy shit right before Russia cyberattacked our election...'
"LOL, are you blind? Russia has been meddling in US affairs since WW II. Everyone has 'cyber attacked' everyone else - whoever has the capability. And by 'cyber' that would be using whatever technological means was available at the time."
'/r/totallynotrobots\n\nBut seriously, this is getting ridiculous with T_D. I want the Reddit admins to enforce the same goddamn policies they force on everyone.   '
"Remember when Russian bots had the largest BLM Facebook group? Stupid ass BLM supporters. They'll believe anything those stupid Russians tell them."
"He's a loser, and never been anything but. He loses in business, loses the popular vote, and now will lose everything. I can't wait to see it happen."
'A trillion gone and nothing to show for it but some corporate welfare and a trade war.  Trump really does suck dicks at this presidenting thing.\n'
'My grandma voted for Trump because "she\'s concerned about the deficit" 😒. Republican politicians these days are not actually fiscally conservative, they just pretend that they are, and complain about spending when Dems are in power.'
"True but thats tied into what I meant. All they care about is in groups and out groups. \n\nIn groups: Whites, republicans, native born, christians, men, hetero\n\nOut groups: non-whites, democrats, immigrants, muslims, atheists, feminists, LGBT\n\nThey'll find a way to blame out groups (a black democrat makes an excellent scapegoat, so does a feminist democrat). But the in group/out group battles are all that matter to these people. \n\nThey'll vote for a guy who is the in group who collapses the economy, then blame the out group for the failure. "
'There\'s absolutely no evidence out there that Trump colluded with the Russians except the Manafort thing, and the Flynn thing, and the Papadopoulos pleading guilty thing, and the Roger Stone thing, and the Cohen thing, and the Kushner thing, and the Carter Page thing, and the Jeff Sessions things, and the Wilbur Ross thing, and the JD Gordon thing, and the Erik Prince thing, and the James Comey firing thing, and the Russian hacking/Wikileaks thing, and the bro-love between TrumPutin thing, and the Russian propaganda machine favoring Trump thing, and the DJT "I have zero ties to Russia!" thing, and the Eric Trump "we get most of our financing from Russian banks thing", and the Donald Trump Jr. "Our portfolio is made up of a disproportionate amount of Russian money" thing, and the DJT "I sold a $60 million mansion to a Russian oligarch known for money laundering for $120 million that he never once lived in " thing, and the Trump business ties with Putin\'s favorite sports athlete Fedor Emilianenko thing, and the Trump International Corporation\'s mysterious private server connection to Alfa Bank, Russia\'s largest commercial bank thing, and the Special prosecutor being named thing, and the I won\'t release my tax returns thing, and the Ivanka Trump\'s vacationing with Putin\'s girlfriend thing, and the 2013 Miss Universe Pageant in Moscow thing, and the Trump companies business ties to Felix Sater, a criminal felon indicted for stock fraud scheme with the Russian mafia thing, and the FL Group Icelandic hedge fund with massive ties to Putin being heavily invested in Trump Soho thing, and the Rex Tillerson/Exxon ties to Russia thing, and the Russian ambassador at Trump Tower sneaking in and out thing, and the Trump tried to roll back Russian sanctions the minute he got elected thing.Other than that, there\'s absolutely no reason to suspect anything.

'It’s one thing to work for a Dutch owned company, or a Russian owned company for that matter.  It is a much different thing when you were hired by a Russian oligarch to run a political campaign for a Russian backed politician, or take payments from a Russian State run news paper for a speaking fee.  It is also a third thing when you then return to the US and work on a successful presidential campaign (after having met the requirements to need to declare yourself a foreign agent) then get appointed to a very high level position which you are then fired from for misrepresenting facts about your personal dealings with Russia, and then get indicted and plead guilty to charges of lying to the FBI about said dealings with Russians.  '
'What about them? \n\nThe police just said yesterday they have enough evidence to indict Netanyahu and the other dude was forced to resign today. That’s why I mentioned those 2. '
"Wow, fuck me I never thought I'd see the day -- I think I just saw two people reddit and discuss a political comment otherwise controversial in a civil manner. "
'Yea the current republicans, many won’t do shit by the looks of it which is ridiculous especially since most have been attacking the FBI'
'you are speaking to people in their 40s here bro, we remember a time when you werent even alive yet. Which also means we have been paying attention and know all about shit you have only heard about in re-runs because we lived through it as adults. nice try tho, kid. You must feel so old at 25. LOL Only a fuck wit in their mid 20s thinks to ask that question. Now use that down vote button you impotent little person.'

"This is coming down to 2 possible scenarios:\n\n1. Mueller found something on Academi/Prince and got sincere cooperation from Prince in return for getting off on a much lighter sentence.\n\n\n2. Prince knew that Mueller was going to come after him sooner or later and scrubbed everything, in hopes that by willingly providing his electronics that Mueller would stay away from the unsavory communications. \n\nI suppose it's a little forward of me to just assume Erik Prince is guilty of something, but it's not like this guy doesn't have a long, colored history of doing questionable shit that does not suit the interests of the United States. "

'The investigation started because of a land deal made 14 years before he took office, and ended when he lied about receiving a BJ from a woman he had not even met when the investigation began.\n\nTHAT is a witch hunt.  4.5 years and $40 million.\n\nIf Mueller had the same kind of leeway, he could interview all of the 19 women who made claims against Trump, delve into Trump University, have testimony from contractors Trump screwed over....it could be endless.'
">On Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen professed ignorance when asked about the findings. “I do not believe that I’ve seen that conclusion that the specific intent was to help President Trump win, I’m not aware of that,” she told reporters after briefing House members on cybersecurity concerns for this year’s midterm elections.\n\nThis scumbag might be the laziest liar I'm the Trump administration, which is really saying something.

"I think we have to admit that the US has failed a  segment of its population and that segment is now failing us.  The very poor and old that are in immediate danger of going homeless or unable to afford their healthcare are being manipulated by the people directly causing their suffering. \n\nYoung men and women unable to save money from their demanding jobs are blaming the poor and not the 1% bleeding them dry.  And lower 'middle class' people who are used to feeling powerless and ignorant when they try to deal with banks and loans clutch at the only item that makes them feel powerful - their guns.  They cling to them the way a COPD patient sucks on a cigarette while their oxygen tubes dangle from their other hand.\n\nThese abused people deserve sympathy, or at least pity.  Most of them will probably be loyal to  those figures until those representatives kill them off."
'We have the answer to that question, it is indisputable at this point the trump campaign coordinated with Russia. The edge lords in opposition are intentionally misinformed, we know their was a concerted effort to unbalance the election with a hostile foreign power, that’s not a debatable point.

'It\'s never their fault, ever. The "everything bad I do, you/they did, and worse" type attitudes are not good for social progress.'
"It's off topic, but brand of insanity in America is different than my country (Indonesia).\n\nWhile their mental gymnastics are nowhere near as insane (the Trump supporter i know would acknowledge the mistake rather than outright calling it bias or whatabouthillary, or simply shifted the blame to other Republican or Trump friends) the pattern of who's going to be sane or insane is almost nonexistent aside of religion. I know many people with potential for cum laude that went anti-feminist, flat earthers, anti-infrastructure, conspiracy theorists etc. Like, almost half, and definitely one-third of intelligent people i know have believes that contradict each others (like how Erdogan's a good boy while Trump's evil fucker). Hell, my father's entire office supported Erdogan, and it's one of the more skill demanding job there.\n\nI don't know which one's more frustrating: The Party before Country/no abortion mindset, or...whatever possessed my country.\n\n"

"No. Hell no. I've seen people lose their security clearance for far less. The straight fact of the matter is, power matters. It would be an embarrassment of the highest caliber to actually convict the former First Lady, the Secretary of State. Someone who has fingers in every section of government and the elite.

'This recent cult that\'s popped up around Trump and Hillary Clinton has literally nothing to do with actual conservatism. Stealing the catch-phrases of the conservative movement doesn\'t make you a conservative. Ballooning the federal deficit while "conservatives" hold both the presidency and congress isn\'t conservative. Allowing a foreign power (Russia, no less) to meddle in the elections of your nation isn\'t conservative. Attacking the CIA and FBI isn\'t conservative. Filling the cabinet with corrupt politicians with massive conflicts of interest that stop them from actually serving their country isn\'t conservative. Banning people from entering your country simply because of their place of birth isn\'t conservatism. \n\nWhat the hell happened? The Republican party was the party of Theodore Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover, and Eisenhower and now it demonizes one of the few principled Republicans that we have left. It used to be the party of conservatism and now it\'s a personality cult that creates its own boogeymen to stay energized. What keeps you holding on to it? Trump and actual conservatism have nothing in common.\n\nYour comment is how I know you don\'t know what American conservatism means.'

"There's a huge issue with FISA courts in that they'll issue pretty much a warrant at request (something like over 95% of FISA warrants are approved when requested), however, this isn't an issue with bias or partisanship, but rather the FISA court system.  What Republicans CAN'T do is support this system for a good decade and a half, keep renewing the PATRIOT Act over and over, which has enabled these courts to behave in this manner, and then cry foul when one of their own becomes a surveillance target due to his illegal ties (ie Carter Page).\n\nThe Fast and Furious issue was with the ATF, which is a completely different department than anything that has to do with this, so what do I think?

"It's human nature though.  The GOP has gone off the deep end and is being led by a skillful conman.  \n\n\nAfter years of advertising I've learned that you don't change minds; you reinforce beliefs that are already there and tap into visceral triggers.  Trump is a racist conman, but he knows how to speak to the gullible racist in all of us. Trump's propaganda works not only on his supporters but also on the media and his opposition.  He gives both sides red meat, and like hungry predators, the news media, his supporters and his opposition continually fall for his shiny objects. \n\nI have empathy for all sides involved, but lament that democrats are not as aggressive or effective as the GOP at voter suppression, because as dug in as Trump voters are, they are by no means the majority, and this reign of terror would not be possible without getting people who believe in democracy to stay home."

"I can't wake someone if one is pretending to be asleep. Even after so many evidences, you still not able to understand that Trump has conned you big time, then wait till he will get impeached. I will text you then with more facts and background stories. Right now, you are addicted with Trump's fake dreams and words, and whatever I will say right now won't get into your ear. However, if you are willing for a debate than I am up for it. Pick a time and platform of your choosing over this. I live in one of the most red state in US, and everyone here are Republicans.

Mueller hasn't even leaked that Trump is a target! Trump is the one saying he's the target!  We know because Trump is having a panic attack. Again Mueller did not even say that Trump is a target. Trump says he's a target! \nHere is all we know:\nMAGA(my advisors are arrested?) His personal attorney was arrested. His entire cabinet has been arrested or subpoenaed. Many of his closest advisors are under house arrest.  Mike Flynn went from patriot to  informant. Manafort under house arrest. Sessions lied under oath about meetings with Russians.

"Gave his wife money for her campaign run in local politics while McCabe made sure ahead of time to violate no ethics rules.

'Apologies for trying to shame man, I get heated.

From the LA Times: \n\n"The U.S. has a long history of attempting to influence presidential elections in other countries – it\'s done so as many as 81 times between 1946 and 2000, according to a database amassed by political scientist Dov Levin of Carnegie Mellon University.\nThat number doesn\'t include military coups and regime change efforts following the election of candidates the U.S. didn\'t like, notably those in Iran, Guatemala and Chile. Nor does it include general assistance with the electoral process, such as election monitoring."\n\nI don\'t think this is right, but I\'m an American patriot, I love this country. But when Russia does this to us, fuck them and fuck their puppet. Trump is a traitor to my country.'
"Exactly. But that's us doing it to another country, which as an American I far prefer to goddamn Russia doing it to us. I'm a Republican, I don't like Hillary, she's shady as hell, I didn't vote for either of them, I think the fact she screwed Bernie so bad is an assault on our democracy too. But that doesn't discount that Russia did this shit to us. Hillary is irrelevant and a distraction to the fact Trump is Russia's bitch, and when an American president is Russia's bitch, he should go to jail for treason. Hell maybe I'm wrong tho the facts make it overwhelmingly seem like I understand this, but at least first let us look into it thoroughly shall we? Let's make sure we're not being forced to be Russia's little bitch. "

Your President and idol is going to be the second in history to resign in disgrace while many people working for him spend years in prison.

This is treason, much worse than wire tapping a hotel, and yet Watergate is (until now) the most famous scandal in US history. This is the horse you've backed."
'> Nobody worth electing breaks into their opponents computers to steal as a part of "opposition research", let alone work with a foreign government, whom we have sanctioned heavily, that uses its intelligence gathering powers to obtain this information. That\'s bullcrap and you know it.\n\nI agree with you. Obama used the fake russian dossier to get FISA warrants to actually spy on the Trump campaign, then he campaigned for Hillary while holding all the illegally gathered information on Trump\'s campaign.\n\nHere\'s the difference. The professor was also lying about e-mails. The DNC wasn\'t hacked. They never let the FBI examine the servers to make any kind of determination. That\'s because it wasn\'t hacked. It was leaked by a DNC insider who was mad about the primaries being a huge fraud when they selected Hillary.\n\nAlso, look up how that russian that briefly met with Trump Jr even got into the country. Look at the other organizations that russian dealt with in the US. GP and this meeting were all honeypot operations, plants by Obama.'

I would rather have somebody with the personality of a used car salesman reality TV star then someone who is polished and charismatic and smooth yet behind the scenes works to make the country weaker. People liked Obama. He was charming. You wanted to invite him home to meet your parents. Yet he expanded the ability of the government to spy on you. He dropped more bombs than just about anybody. His use of drones was outrageous and disgusting. The national debt was doubled. He routinely gave large amounts of money to countries that we have no business giving money to when our own citizens need help.    \nDo not make the mistake of looking for style over substance.    \nI'll add that one of the most disappointing things about Obama was that he had a chance to address the real problems in the black community. They don't want to hear that from a white dude but they would have listened to him. Yet he only made things more divided without addressing the problems that are destroying their communities."

You are stuck with them. You cannot get rid of them. They are contaminated, They are programmed to think and react to certain stimuli in a certain pattern. You cannot change their mind even if you expose them to authentic information, even if you prove that white is white and black is black you still cannot change the basic perception and illogical behavior. In other words, these people, the process of demoralization is complete and irreversible. To get rid society of these people you need another twenty or fifteen years to educate a new generation of patriotically-minded and commonsense people who would be acting in favor and in the interests of the United States society."\n\n"A person who was demoralized is unable to assess true information.

Even if I take him by force to the Soviet Union and show him concentration camp he will refuse to believe it until he is going to receive a kick in his fat bottom.

WE ARE LOSING. we were losing during the Obama administration. We specifically need both ICE and our intelligence agencies strong af right now and we have been trolled into one being pitted against the other. WE ARE LOSING.

It was a success for freedom and democracy that Snowden leaked info. That transparency is literally why we are fighting and balancing democracy with security is messy, but we are getting there and part of that is having our asses handed to us. We need to accept that if trump is compromised then getting dems to protest ICE was the plan. \n\nI’m pretty sure when yeltsin and Clinton were buddying up shit was cool, but that was about it for a Cold War reprieve. Putin is a different animal. He’s KGB and he’s beating our asses. He has us chasing our tails and loving it. We need America to realize who she is on both sides of the isle. If we remember what we stand for and have pride in our freedoms and our press instead of cannibalizing ourselves, we will fuck shit up. If we realize how completely we have been played, we can let go of some of our internal animosity. I mean, really? One side wants to abolish ICE and the other is against the FBI? Jeeze\n\nIf you think that proving trump is guilty is a victory worthy of anything but sober re-evaluation of our assumptions and reaching out to the republicans who have been violated in the worst way, you’re not paying attention. I assure you that the trump supporters will continue to make life worse for all of us and more and more overtly play into Putin’s hands if the rest of us somehow count any of this as victory.

'Your analysis assumes a ration thinking person\'s way of handling this. We all know how this is going to go down. Or at least this is how I see it going down. Mueller investigation make major headline (maybe Kushner indictment or bannon), likely later in the week. Trump has a meeting with someone on Friday with someone that says firing Mueller is a good idea (I assume to "stall things"). He\'s outside of his time around normal adults (if you can call them that), and he starts stewing. First at how much Mueller is in the news instead of his tweet.

'Rod Rosenstein had nothing to do with the FBI and he\'s the one who assigned Mueller.

We also know that the classified information was redacted in the memos he shared **AND** it was leaked **AFTER** the investigation was announced which was within 2 days of said termination whereas the Comey memos were released that Friday.  Mueller terminated the never Trumper from his team the moment he found out about the texts.

"You don't understand the nature of the indictments, do ya?  Mueller is not going to make subordinates (Manafort, Papadopolous, Flynn) plead to any real charges relating to Russia directly.  He doesn't want to, and doesn't have to, tip his hand as to the nature of what he has.  But, he will get co-operation, because he got plea deals nonetheless. \n\nYour guy, the least popular President ever, is in for a hell of a ride.  Buckle up, son."

"At the end of his presidency, Obama's economy had relatively low unemployment, a stock market that had increased nearly 3-fold under his tenure, the US out of most large-scale military interventions, and the vast majority of citizens covered in terms of health insurance.\n\nThat was a major improvement over the GOP years, that ended with us in a $5.6 Trillion war in Iraq and an economy in a death spiral under Bush in 2008."
"... which is why there are already indictments and guilty pleas related to the Russia scandal.\n\nConsider: the charges against the Arthur Andersen firm weren't identical to the conspiracy charges later filed against individual Enron C-level execs at the culmination of the investigation. By your logic, the AA charges had no relation with the Enron investigation because the charges weren't aimed directly at Enron, and the charges weren't the same as the charges later aimed at Enron execs. Which is absurd, and completely detached from how investigations actually work. Smaller, tangential indictments can be and _are frequently_ used to build bigger cases against other entities.\n\nTL;DR: You're not convincing anybody, the existing indictments and guilty pleas are valid and indicative of progress on the investigation, and eeenjoOoOoy your ride on the Muellercoaster!"

Men who have nothing to hide do NOT lie to the FBI.

For this reason I believe that not clearly marking articles as “satire” is causing a problem. I believe there are too many joke articles masquerading as real news and fooling people who aren’t skeptical or internet-savvy.

Trump was made for modern politics (especially republican playbook style politics)"
'Still, really crude and kinda sexist.'
">Trump is untouchable right now\n\nThat's some incredibly wishful thinking.\n\nHis lawyers are trying to make that argument, but it doesn't really match up with reality.\n\n>He is doing what he promised \n\nYou're being lied to.\n\n>and his supporters couldn't be happier\n\n...because they're being lied to.\n\n>I hate trump but the reality is that he is doing just fine\n\nThat's an incredibly contradictory statement.\n\nI don't think I believe you."

And neither are his friends.\n\n>Trumps opponents are totally ineffectual against what he is\n\nThat's fine, Mueller isn't Trump's opponent.\n\nMueller is Trump's *investigator*.  \n\nInvestigators have mountains of dirt on Trump.  He's a very dirty man.\n"
"I have no doubt that Trump will pardon whoever and whenever. He doesn't care about the rule of law. He doesn't care about the dignity of the office he got elected to.\n\nAnd the sad fact is that his supporters don't care either. They like to pretend they're patriots, but they sure as shit aren't."
"Keep in mind that pardons only apply to *admitted* crimes and make no sense for crimes that did not happen.  Pardons don't apply to all crimes.  They aren't a way to wash guilt away, but are ways to admit guilt while not being prosecuted or punished for those actual crimes.\n\nSo, if the president pardons me for murder ... but I've never hurt someone so bad that they required a doctor let alone a mortician ... the pardon is meaningless.  Not only didn't I say I murdered someone, nor did anyone attempt to convict me of murder, ... no people died ... so ... no murder.  No pardon can be granted to me for murder, nor would it make much sense since I didn't kill anyone.\n\nFor me to have a pardon, I'd have to have admitted to a crime and come clean on that actual crime.  So, let's say I admit to speeding.  Say -- horrors! -- there were times I exceeded the posted legal speed limit.  I'm guilty.  The pardon can't be for all crimes or even all traffic related infractions ... it can only be for speeding and other admitted crimes.   ***It can't be for future crimes as even if I intended to do commit a crime, I have not yet and can't be pardoned for that intent proactively -- for both practical and legal reasons.***\n\nWith that in mind, if Trump pardons someone he pardons them for specific actual crimes.  When he does that, the details of those crimes must be disclosed or the pardon can not apply.  The pardoned don't walk.  The pardoned are required to step forward and divulge their crimes as a part of their pardon."
">Can one refuse a pardon?\n\nYes.  Just refuse to admit guilt, which would probably be the smart move for everyone involved.\n\nWhen you are dealing with a man like Mueller, taking the first bad option that he offers you is your smartest move, because it won't get any better from there.  Anyone that takes a Trump pardon will not only be mauled by State prosecutors for the rest of their lives, but they can also expect more Federal charges later, once Trump is out of office.\n\nPaul Manafort is especially vulnerable to prosecution outside of Trump's pardon power, as he is looking at potential mass murder charges in Ukraine.  His least bad option now is to die in Federal custody.\n"
'Mass murder? Can you elaborate on this?'
'Mass murder relates to 100s of protesters being gunned down in Ukraine. A string of text messages between his daughters discussing blood money and how he knowingly had people killed there was hacked and released to the press. \nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/paul-manafort-daughter-text-messages-ukraine-2017-3\n'
'My guess is that he is fired on 3/30 but the nation goes ape shit and he reinstated 3 days later.'
"Can we stop saying that Trump will fire Mueller?  He can't.  Only Jeff Sessions can (I think...).\n\nThat may be semantics, but it's also true.\n\nWhat I expect...\n\n1. Trump will tell Sessions to fire Mueller \n2. Sessions will fire Mueller \n2.1. Trump will tweet a victory speech, he'll call Fox News, Hannity will have kittens on air...\n3. Trump will fire Sessions shortly thereafter because he lacked candor in his confirmation hearing\n"

'Good point. I am wondering if sealed charges may have been handed down already. There are, I think, jurisdictional problems, as crimes committed overseas, may not be prosecutable under State laws and of course, issues of double jeopardy, but State Tax fraud laws are closely comparable to Federal ones, but not the same, as State and Federal taxes are paid separately. Bank Fraud charges are prosecuted all the time at the State level.I think most do not realize either, that State charges are usually withdrawn if a Federal charge is alleged against a defendant.But this is only a courtesy, not a requirement. States would rather save the money instead of spending it prosecuting someone who will be going to jail anyway, on a federal charge, although they sometimes do. In this case, with the "threat" of a Presidential pardon clouding cooperation of some defendants who may have information, a strategy with State AG\'s would be manifest. The fact that the current acting State AG for New York, Barbara Underwood, has already started legal proceeding against the President, something the previous NY AG, Eric Schneiderman, failed to do, although had a high legal profile against Trump, is welcome and good news for State involvement in Trump scandals.'

'**Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act**\n\nThe Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, commonly referred to as the RICO Act or simply RICO, is a United States federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization. The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering and allows the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes they ordered others to do or assisted them in doing, closing a perceived loophole that allowed a person who instructed someone else to, for example, murder, to be exempt from the trial because they did not actually commit the crime personally.RICO was enacted by section 901(a) of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 (Pub.L. 91–452, 84 Stat. 922, enacted October 15, 1970) and is codified at 18 U.S.C. ch. 96 as 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

'The smugness of you leftists when you’re wrong is just astounding to me. There have been literally dozens of leaks from the mueller investigation. The newest one, which happened just yesterday, is regarding Cohen and how he plans to “flip” on trump. Are you not aware of that leak? '
"Deny deny deny! \n\nTrump admitted to obstruction of justice when he says he fired Comey over Russia.  The dumbass didn't even realize he was confessing to a crime.  And you're too stupid to realize it yourself."

Don\'t get me wrong, u/kosmokramor is frustratingly brainwashed (or trolling). But calling him an idiot just perpetuates the cycle -- he knows, that\'s why he\'s so steadfastly against facts. If he can\'t use them as well as you, he may as well pretend they\'re not worth anything.\n\nWhat I meant by "two people with no facts" is that you were both literally writing insults at each other with no intention of actually arguing, or even conversing. If *you* want to put some effort into this and actually have a productive discussion maybe you should try to treat u/kosmokramor like a human being -- even if he his being an asshole. All this division and in-fighting is **exactly** what Russian propaganda is intended to elicit. We\'re all falling into their trap if we can\'t have calm, reasoned discussions.

"Calling it a 'witch hunt' is by no means 'playing along.'

And that is basically attack the investigation at every turn. He even considered firing Mueller, but his lawyers threatened to quit. \n\nWhat do you think he's hiding if not crimes?"
'This is a bit far out and I haven’t read the memo, but I’ve been wondering if the memo wasn’t meant purely to discredit, but as a threat of what can be declassified.\n\nJust how much of the FBI investigation does the House Intelligence Committee have access to? It seems far too blatant, even for Nunes and Trump, but could confidential sources be revealed, or threatened into silence?'
"Mueller should see this memo for what it is:  an exit ramp, and an excuse for him to bow out gracefully.  He can always claim he didn't know all of this stuff when he accepted the job as SC, and keep his reputation in tact.  He was handed a plastic sword and thrown into battle.  It's not his fault, but he's only doing more damage by hanging around.  Damage to the reputation of the fbi and the nation.  "
'it entirely destroys the basis of the investigation, gg wonder whats gonna happen to you losers in here sill waiting for "mueller time" *snoooooze*'

'**Cohen claims Trump knew in advance of 2016 Trump Tower meeting**\n\nCohen\'s claim would contradict repeated denials by Trump, Donald Trump Jr., their lawyers and other administration officials who have said that the President knew nothing about the Trump Tower meeting until he was approached about it by The New York Times in July 2017.\n\nCohen alleges that he was present, along with several others, when Trump was informed of the Russians\' offer by Trump Jr. By Cohen\'s account, Trump approved going ahead with the meeting with the Russians, according to sources.\n\nRELATED: Michael Cohen tape leak could complicate his legal troubles\n\nTo be clear, these sources said Cohen does not have evidence, such as audio recordings, to corroborate his claim, but he is willing to attest to his account.\n\nCohen privately testified last year to two Congressional committees investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. A source familiar with Cohen\'s House testimony said he did not testify that Trump had advance knowledge. Cohen\'s claims weren\'t mentioned in separate reports issued by Republicans and Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nContacted by CNN, one of Cohen\'s attorneys, Lanny Davis, declined to comment.\n\n"He\'s been lying all week, he\'s been lying for years," said Rudy Giuliani, the President\'s attorney, to Chris Cuomo on CNN\'s "Cuomo Prime Time" on Thursday night.\n\nHe added, "I don\'t see how he\'s got any credibility."\n\nGiuliani also said Cohen is "the kind of witness that can really destroy your whole case" and called Cohen, who was a top Trump Organization attorney for a decade, a "pathological liar."\n\nRELATED: WSJ: Top Trump Organization official subpoenaed to testify in Michael Cohen probe\n\n"Donald Trump Jr. has been professional and responsible throughout the Mueller and Congressional investigations," said Alan Futerfas, an attorney for Donald Trump Jr. "We are very confident of the accuracy and reliability of the information that has been provided by Mr. Trump, Jr., and on his behalf."\n\nAccording to people who have discussed the matter with Cohen, he has expressed hope that this claim about the Trump Tower meeting will help him reach out to Mueller and possibly lessen his legal troubles. He\'s under scrutiny by federal prosecutors in Manhattan after Mueller referred Cohen\'s case to them.\n\nThe June 2016 meeting was arranged after a publicist who knew Trump Jr. told him in emails -- in no uncertain terms -- that a senior Russian official "offered to provide the Trump campaign" with damaging information about Clinton, and that the outreach was "part of Russia and its government\'s support for Mr. Trump." At the time, the Russian operation to covertly boost Trump\'s candidacy wasn\'t publicly known. Trump. Jr. responded, "if it\'s what you say, I love it," and started to arrange the meeting.\n\nRELATED: The night Michael Cohen went to war with Donald Trump\n\nAt the meeting, Trump Jr. was joined by his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, who was Trump\'s campaign chairman at the time. There were four Russians in the room, including a lawyer with Kremlin ties, a businessman who worked for an oligarch and a lobbyist with old KGB connections.\n\nAfter news of the meeting broke in July 2017, the Trump team offered misleading explanations and changed their story several times. But one claim stayed consistent: that Trump had no knowledge of the meeting beforehand, wasn\'t told about it afterward and first learned about it one year later.\n\nThose denials were repeatedly issued by Trump, his attorney Jay Sekulow, Trump Jr., Futerfas and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. Those people denied that Trump had contemporaneous knowledge of the meeting on more than 15 occasions, according to CNN\'s analysis.\n\nExclusive: CNN obtains secret Trump-Cohen tape\n\nTrump said on July 12, 2017, that he "only heard about it two or three days ago." One week later, Trump repeated that he "didn\'t know anything about the meeting" because "nobody told me" about it.\n\nAround that same time, CNN\'s Jake Tapper asked Sekulow to confirm Trump\'s claims that he only recently learned about the controversial meeting. Sekulow\'s response: "Yes, I swear."\n\nBut perhaps the highest-stakes denial was given by Trump Jr. in his testimony last year to the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n"He wasn\'t aware of it," Trump Jr. told lawmakers, referring to his father\'s knowledge of the meeting. "And, frankly, by the time anyone was aware of it, which was summer of this year, as I stated earlier, I wouldn\'t have wanted to get him involved in it because it had nothing to do with him."\n\nRELATED: Michael Cohen sent up flares, but Trump never came to help\n\nTrump\'s critics have long doubted these denials. They point to a series of phone calls Trump Jr. made to a blocked phone number before and after the meeting. They also note that two days before the meeting, Trump mysteriously announced plans to give a "major speech" about Clinton\'s scandals. Trump Jr. says he didn\'t get any dirt at the meeting -- and the speech never happened.\n\nEven Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist and top Trump campaign official, said the meeting was "treasonous" and speculated that "the chance that Don Jr. did not walk these (Russians) up to his father\'s office on the twenty-sixth floor is zero." Trump Jr. has denied Bannon\'s allegation. Bannon\'s comments, to author Michael Wolff for his book "Fire and Fury," triggered the bitter public divorce between Bannon and Trump in early 2018.\n\nAxios reported that Bannon does not have first-hand knowledge about whether Trump Jr. told his father, and Bannon later said his "treasonous" remark was directed at Manafort and not Trump Jr.\n\nUpdate: This story has been updated with more comments by Rudy Giuliani.\n\n✌ cool people read before commenting ✌'

While on it's surface you might think the same as you did here, but, if you have a shitty job and your boss gives you a hard time about voting, you'll be less likely to stand and wait in a long line to vote.

It does not mean and attempt to undermine the democracy as we know it, it meas they attempted to get around the system.\n\nFurthermore, these actions likely took place before his inclusion in the campaign, whatever role he may have had.

'47% of people apparently watch Fox News.  Lest we forget why the probe even exists:  Trump fired the FBI Director to impede an investigation into his National Security Adviser who was fired for being a crazy, abusive, conspiratorial nutjob in the workplace by the previous administration which also warned Trump not to hire him.  Why were they investigating him?  He was being paid by the government of Turkey, did not disclose it and was planning the kidnapping of a U.S. Resident who is here under an asylum visa because that thug Erdogan wants to bring him back and torture/kill him for opposing his tyrannical government.'
'There\'s also a large percentage of people who are "unsure," and I wouldn\'t write them off as being fox-news-watchers. I mean, we haven\'t even seen the investigation come to a close and seen the entire thing yet, so it\'s not fair to criticize people for being "unsure." Here\'s the text from the article:\n\n>A majority of Americans (53%) consider Mueller’s investigation to be fair, a modest increase from 48% previously. 28% think the probe is unfair, and one in five (20%) are unsure. A partisan divide exists. While 77% of Democrats and 51% of independents perceive the investigation to be fair, a plurality of Republicans (46%) say it is unfair. 35% of the GOP, though, think the investigation is being carried out without prejudice, and a notable 19% of Republicans are unsure.'

'https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/12/03/politics/flynn-firing-dowd-tweet/index.html\n\n> Pressed about whether the tweet signaled Trump knew Flynn had lied to the FBI before firing him, Dowd rejected the assessment.\n\n> "At the time of the firing no one including Justice had accused Flynn of lying," Dowd told CNN. "Yates had reported he told the (agents) the same things he told VP. He was not accused of lying until last week."\n\nBasically it means that Trump knew Flynn lied to him and Pence and the FBI about being a foreign agent before he was hired - which means that Trump only fired him once they got caught... but they backtracked hard and pinned it on Trumps Lawyer when people pointed this out. Remember Trump fired Comey so he would stop the Flynn investigation because there was “nothing to hide” ... or in lamens terms - he obstructed an investigation.\n\nEdit: for clarity\n\n\n\n'

The other Oligarchs got the message and cut Putin in on the embezzlement.  \n\nI don\'t think Muller is going to be able to charge Trump in a month.

"Trump fucked a lot of women. Many of  whom sought to have their sordid stories made public after Donnie Moscow won the GOP nomination, likely for the money they'd get from the tabloids and the like.  Stormy Daniels is one such woman. To prevent these stories from coming out, Donnie instructed his personal attorney to pay them hush money and sign NDAs to enforce their silence in the months before the election in 2016. That attorney was Cohen. But Donnie Moscow doesn't have much cash lying around, because he's massively in debt to a number of foreign investors (aka leveraged). These investors are mostly Russian oligarchs. So when it comes time to pay that hush money, Donnie has to ask his investors for a little more cash. Cohen goes to Prague to talk to the oligarchs and makes the ask. They comply, and Cohen gets the money. Cohen pays the women. \n\nTLDR; Donnie Moscow used Russian money to pay off porn stars he fucked while the first lady was pregnant with Baron Trump. Yup, it's that salacious. "
'They both suck. \n\nThis election cycle was a bad one. '
'That\'s whats been said, but new information contradicts that. (Trump paying Cohen back)  The violations accrue to Cohen, every time he uses that "tainted money" so if he made payments to Stormy Daniels using that money, its a violation, but also a violation every time he paid out money, that can be established coming from those funds, to pay for things were campaign related or otherwise restricted from doing so.'

'There are always a few comments that are so dumb they stop you in your tracks. This is one of those comments.'
"Anything you do for security is a matter of shifting the balance of cost to circumvent and expected value. Most information that people shred wouldn't be particularly valuable to the FBI, and while it might be useful to a criminal, private investigator, etc., if its value is less than the cost of reassembling it (which still requires labor and computational resources), then it's relatively safe.\n\nYou can apply the same idea, for example, to a bike lock. Say your bike can be sold for $50 stolen, and you put a lock on it that will take a skilled thief five minutes to pick, and a chain that can't be easily cut. Sure, it's completely feasible to steal it, but it's probably not economical to do so. Any smart thief will move on to a bike with no lock, or one with an easily snipped cable, or a lock that can be raked in 30 seconds. And even if _everyone_ uses the same lock and chain as you used, thieves will focus on more expensive bikes, or on non-bike opportunities which are either easier or higher value."
'Okay I just got a notification that somebody said "Can you be arrested without charge?" Yes, you can be arrested without charge. Sometimes a suspect is arrested and then questioned before prosecutors decide which charges to file if any. Police can only hold suspects for a limited amount of time before releasing the suspect.

This is why the only thing you ever tell a police officer if you think you are being investigated is "no comment, I would like a lawyer please." '

'No. When they arrest you, you are under suspicion. You can be arrested so the police can try to extract a confession or some kind of incriminating statement.

"no, I don't. I conside propaganda to be an attempt to put down the American government and I think it's clear that this propaganda is created mostly by Russians in an attempt to overthrow the American government. [According to 18 U.S. Code § 2384 - Seditious conspiracy:](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2384)\n\nIf two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof, they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.\n\nSo, in my opinion, conspiring in mass groups to lie about America in an intentional effort to destroy it is treason, not free speech and intentionally allowing those groups to exist on the platfrom you control could constitute as conspiring."
"Can you show me one left-leaning sub dedicated to out-right lies and propaganda to the extreme the_donald is? We're not talking about an isolated incident or two here. If you can show me a left-leaning sub that operates the same as the donald, intentionally lying on a daily basis, banning anyone who attempts to point out the truth and brigading every other subreddit, then I will call for that sub to be banned as well. I'm against propaganda on either side, if its intent is to harm America. But I believe in all earnesty that there is not an equal balance of propaganda happening between left and right. \n\nedit: ~~it's~~ its"
"I agree wholeheartedly. Lies about what is factual cannot be debated because the liar is not acting in good faith. They cannot be trusted to support their beliefs with facts. Engaging with them does not good: it only spreads the lies further, and if someone is willing to make up facts and evidence to support their position, then truth will not convinced them otherwise. \n\nThe dissemination of propaganda is psychological warfare against society as a whole, and the victims include those who believe the propaganda, as well as those harmed by the actions undertaken by those who believe the propaganda. \n\nFor the good of our society, and in the hopes of maintaining trust, social media and news sites should remove counterfactual statements and images presented as the truth. Falsehoods should be labeled as such, and should be presented as the lies that they are. \n\nPlease understand that I'm only referring to lies about what the facts are. It's fine for people to disagree and argue as long as they don't create propaganda in support of their position."
"They're real enough. Sure there are some bots posting in T_D but there are millions of people who believe every word said on the internet. Add partisan zealotry to our general inability to resist what we see on social media and you will find that T_D's views are supported by quite a few Americans.  You underestimate how easy it is to work people into a fervor of hatred, especially if what they read confirms their darkest beliefs."
"using the wrong photo by mistake and staging are very different things. There was absolutely no need to fake the photo. The real photos are actually much worse. Some confused intern probably grabbed the wrong image from google, and they're using it as a platform to claim *photos*, key word there, no that one photo, photos of the children were staged. "

"> That's probably the first accomplishment people tend to list for him.\n\nNo, it's not.  Mueller is the man who brought down Sammy Gravano and John Gotti, the heads of the Gambino family.\n\nGotti, for the younger here who don't remember, was known as the Teflon Don because charges never stuck to him... bribery, corruption, witness tampering.\n\nLong and short is... Mueller offered a deal to Gravano in exchange for a drastically reduced sentence on NINETEEN murders directly connected to him, in exchange for testimony against Gotti.\n\nLet me rephrase that: Mueller was willing to trade 19 lives to get his man... THEN, he turned around and nailed Gravano on *other* charges anyway.\n\nLet me put this into perspective:  I have a friend who knew a DEA agent involved with an FBI agent in what was supposed to be a relatively low-level drug sting that went bad.  It resulted in a shootout.  It turned out that one of the dealers who got shot was connected to the Gambinos.\n\nAs soon as the FBI found out who he was, both the FBI agent and the DEA agent were flown out of the country and into hiding the next day.  And this was for a low level Gambino family member...  Mueller took down the two heads of the most powerful of the Five Families.\n\nMueller's biggest target isn't Trump... it's the Russian mob.

Some of the houses sold on to the Hannity-linked firm in 2012 had been acquired by Brock from banks later named by prosecutors among his victims. But the justice department declined to identify specific properties sold in the rigged auctions\n\nThis might end with handcuffs. "
"Since he didn't get caught up in the Fox harassment scandals, I think this is unlikely.\n\nHannity was an informal advisor to DJT's campaign. He has been attacking Mueller longer than any of his fellow Fox anchors. \n\nI think there's a good chance his conversations with Cohen related to collusion."
"I'm not at all sure I'd say he's more honest than Trump, if for no other reason than the fact that he's used his bully pulpit to spread lies for a couple decades now. Trump has had the pulpit for a much shorter timeframe. \n\nThey're both despicable liars. Both have built their careers on the backs of their lies, but Hannity's lies have infected political discourse in this country to the extent that we now have Trump in office. If Hannity and his ilk didn't have a pulpit, neither would Trump. "
"> Since he didn't get caught up in the Fox harassment scandals\n\nI guarantee you he took part in constructing the scandal though so he could usurp O'Reilly's position. I'm not saying the sexual harrassment didn't happen, i'm just saying he knew about it and let it blow up so he could take O'Reilly's job. "

Because...\n\n- [Nunes was a member of the Trump transition team](http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-rep-devin-nunes-named-to-trump-s-1478893307-htmlstory.html). He could be implicated in any of the crimes committed during that period and has a huge personal stake in the outcome of the investigation. Once the House started investigating the Russia Affair, the only ethical (and possibly the only *legal*) course of action for Nunes was to recuse himself. However...\n\n- [Nunes refused to recuse himself from the House investigation into Russian election interference](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-white-house-and-republicans-blew-up-the-house-russia-investigation). Despite the obvious conflict of interest, he spent weeks stalling the investigation. He kept the committee from calling witnesses, derailed testimony with a litany of irrelevant questions, and in general did all he could to sabotage the investigation from within.\n\n- [Nunes gave a bizarre press conference attacking the intelligence community for picking up Trump campaign associates during lawful surveillance of Russians](https://www.thedailybeast.com/devin-nunes-vanished-the-night-before-he-made-trump-surveillance-claims). The agencies responsible for intelligence-gathering and counterintelligence are *supposed* to be surveilling these people. Trump\'s claims of being "wiretapped" were still in the news around this time, and Nunes probably thought he was vindicating the president. Instead, the tactic backfired.\n\n- [Nunes stepped back from the investigation amid controversy in April, but did so in a way that fell short of recusal.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/politics/devin-nunes-house-intelligence-committee-russia.html) He kept a lower profile, but he made no promises of non-interference. In fact, there was nothing preventing him from continuing to meddle in the investigation. So predictably...\n\n- [Nunes continued to interfere in the investigation](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-nunes-recuse-or-not-20170602-htmlstory.html), and he eventually [issued subpoenas related to the Steele dossier.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nunes-issues-subpoenas-to-fusion-gps/) This was the dossier that alleged Russian collusion with the Trump campaign, along with some less-relevant but more salacious things involving hookers and piss. Nunes and other Republicans made a concerted attempt to discredit the dossier as untrustworthy and/or part of some Democratic conspiracy despite a steady stream of evidence that the dossier is accurate.\n\n- [Along with with other Republicans, Nunes has tried to mischaracterize the Steele dossier as evidence of corruption at the Department of Justice](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/20/house-republicans-quietly-investigate-doj-fbi-310121). Again, the claims were meritless, but for whatever reason the Steele dossier keeps coming up.  It was already known that the dossier was commissioned as *Republican* opposition research during the primaries and only picked up by the Democrats in the general election. But what makes this especially funny is that..\n\n- [One of Nunes\' donors commissioned the same Steele dossier that Nunes is claiming as evidence of a Democratic conspiracy](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/12/28/1728250/-NEW-Devin-Nunes-Campaign-Donor-Was-Original-Funder-Of-Trump-Russia-Dossier). This is OP\'s story. It\'s not a bombshell, but it\'s just another data point along a trendline that points to what a slimy piece of shit Devin Nunes is. \n\nSo now you know a bit more about Devin Nunes. This should get you started, and in the future just keep your ears to the ground. There will be more. The GOP my be broadly complicit in the Russia Affair, but hacks like Nunes are basically guaranteed to have worse skeletons in their closet.\n\n----\n\n**TL;DR: Nunes is a former Trump transition team member who has been interfering with the House Russia investigation through his position as Chair of the House Intel Committee. He is quite possibly committing obstruction of justice.**'
'Thank you. \n\nI was trying to be as concise and to the point as possible, but you could write a book about Nunes and the fuckery he is involved in. The man was is one of the underappreciated villains of the Russia Affair.\n\n'

'He wrote the letter, but didn\'t want to fire Comey if I recall.\n\nAnd the letter was a poison pill for Trump, saying, in essence "Comey was unethically mean to Hillary by discussing a closed case against her"     (which Comey apparently did to head off a leak by the pro-Trump NYC FBI office)\n\n'
"Nothingburger my ass.\n\nt_D on suicide watch, although that's nothing new. "

"> t_D on suicide watch\n\nits strange there's no mention of this on t_D"

"I would like to remind everybody that the Vietnam war was a complete shitshow and the left actively protested against it and did everything they could to avoid being drafted. I know multiple draft dodgers that fled to Canada, enrolled in university, and did anything possible to avoid going to that horrible war. Those on the right or who were not wealthy/crafty enough to avoid begin drafted went there to die. To summarize the attitudes of the left at the time please refer to the protest songs of pete seeger, phil ochs, john lennon etc.\n\nI know people want to bash trump for this but I would've done the same thing. Of course, his criticism of war heroes etc complicate the matter and he should be criticized in that regard"
"Again, there is *nothing* wrong with dodging the draft. Conscription is murder. Conscription is slavery.\n\nThe hypocrisy isn't okay, and people who dodge the draft should be proud and open about it, but I won't ever use draft dodging as a way to criticize Trump. There's plenty of real reasons already."
'Avoiding being sent to fight in a war because of a moral objection is one thing. Do that, take the heat and own it and that\'s fine. Using your wealth and connections to get out of it while poor people go die in your place, never standing up against the war or for those who can\'t get out of it, and then saying your rich playboy lifestyle was your Vietnam, going on then to cynically engage in jingoism and using "the troops" as a political football is a-whole-nother thing.'
">I know people want to bash trump for this but I would've done the same thing. Of course, his criticism of war heroes etc complicate the matter and he should be criticized in that regard\n\nThey don't complicate it, they **invalidate it**. trump is a fucking despicable coward. "
'I don’t really blame him for draft dodging, Hell my grandparents had a plan set in motion so that my dad wouldn’t get drafted where they’d go up to Canada. I have a problem with him draft dodging and then saying things like ‘I prefer people who weren’t captured’ about John McCain who is also a literal war hero'
"I'd argue that in order to have war heroes, you need to have a war worth fighting."
'Trump vs. the Porn Star...who are you gonna believe?  The fake blond with the big tits or Story Daniels?'
"Alot of people are not reading between the lines here.\n\nTrump's lawyer made the payment to Stormy Daniels which would normally be OK but counts as an illegal campaign contribution because of his ties to the campaign (working from trump tower). That is campaign fraud, trump can make this go away by returning the money to his lawyer and submitting a statement to the FEC that he provided the money himself. But that would be admitting to an extramarital affair. Which is something he is probably not willing to do yet. This all this relavant to Meuller's special council which is investigating trump for russian meddling and campaign fraud. This story was given to 60 minutes as a gift to Mueller and as political capital to Congressional democrats in case of an impeachment process.\n\nIt can be used by Mueller during a subpoena against the POTUS. That would be bad because trump's head lawyer has resigned and trump is having trouble replacing him. entering a deposition without a lawyer is extremly unadvisable.\n\nTrump can elect to fire Mueller before charges are pressed but republicans have promised this will lead to impeachment. Which would buy him time and he may have a better chance of winning through his allies in congress.\n\nTLDR. This isn't just disgusting sex gossip, If trump doesn't handle his stormy Daniel's problem, he is looking campaign fraud charges."
'I got banned for asking about evidence of fraud that they were posting about. \n\nGoddamn, Snowflakes '
'This is an old canard. When they lose they claim voter fraud (when Trump won, he claimed voter fraud too). They want to disenfranchise every vote they can. We know this.'
'Wanted - Dead or Alive\n\nAnyone who upsets my view of the world.  We will ask questions later...maybe.\n\n/s'
'T_D and the T_C love to hate on Russia investigation but yet when they lose an election they instantly do a 180 and start accusing liberals of voter fraud.\n\nBoth subs are full of nothing but hypocrites. '
"They claim voter fraud if they didn't win with at least 100% of the vote."
"Oversimplified for sure, but: It's seen as them not being responsible citizens in the first place, thus they have power removed from them as part of their punishment. People also don't want criminals influencing who gets elected, because once you're a criminal in this society, you are seen as a piece of junk. Reform is really not valued or seen as possible/worthwhile in this culture."
"**Felony disenfranchisement**\n\nFelony disenfranchisement is the exclusion from voting of people otherwise eligible to vote (known as disfranchisement) due to conviction of a criminal offense, usually restricted to the more serious class of crimes: felonies. Jurisdictions vary as to whether they make such disfranchisement permanent, or restore suffrage after a person has served a sentence, or completed parole or probation. Felony disenfranchisement is one among the collateral consequences of criminal conviction and the loss of rights due to conviction for criminal offense.\n\nProponents have argued that persons who commit felonies have 'broken' the social contract, and have thereby given up their right to participate in a civil society.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28"

"
'Who are my overlords this time?\n\nCuz it certainly isn\'t the Republican president OR the Republican "pretending" to investigate his ass.\n\nYou fuckers will see when Mueller comes out of his cave in 3 years to say "Turns out treason is legal now" while you assholes enabled him and his orange Russian oligarch.  \n\nStringing people on with false hope while he destroys our country ... and you think I\'M the one doing harm?'

'Do you find it odd that this is the exact same catfish they tried with DTJr?\n\n"I have dirt on Hillary, oh wait nevermind I\'m a Russian liaison."\n\nSounds like legit collusion to me, [I guess that\'s why Trump lifted those sanctions from Crimea and the Magnitsky Act, as opposed to leaving them indefinitely as a matter of state dept policy.](http://www.newsweek.com/american-sanctions-russia-wont-be-lifted-until-crimea-returned-ukraine-says-588849)\n\nThe ironic thing is that there is indeed Russian dirt on Hillary in the form of the Uranium One deal.\n\n\n'
'> True outsiders (trump, mark cuban?) have the best chance at destroying it from within.\n\nThat\'s not what these indictments appear to be showing. Manafort was laundering money and evading taxation so that the source of his tens of millions wouldn\'t be revealed. There is ample evidence that strongly suggests that money came from pro-Russian Ukranians. There is also evidence proving Papadopoulos tried to (or succeeded) in arranging meetings between other Trump campaign officials and Russian political figures.\n\nAssuming for the sake of argument that Trump knew nothing about this and had no involvement whatsoever with these dealings, this proves that he is 100% unqualified to "drain the swamp". Someone who can\'t even guarantee the integrity of his own campaign managers (a handful of people whom he is working closely with on a daily basis) is certainly in no position to evaluate every member of Congress and endorse suitable replacements. \n\n> People do their own research now and actually understand politics.\n\nI disagree. People do their own research, yes, but they are incredibly bad at evaluating sources. "I did my research! Do your research!" is actually a rallying cry for the anti-vax movement, and political echo chambers are not far behind. I have noticed that in general, the more people stress doing their "own" research, the more likely it is that the sources they have chosen to rely on are anxious armchair theorists at best, and shady snake-oil salesmen at worst. They choose these sources because of anti-establishment sentiments. People don\'t trust authority anymore, and conspiracy theories provide comfort because they offer certainties delivered by people outside of the established authorities. Just like you said, people don\'t trust CNN or Fox, so whatever they see that *isn\'t* being reported on TV news is automatically given stronger consideration. If it *isn\'t* being reported in major newspapers by professional journalists, it is "what *they* don\'t want us to know". Which opens up the door to a lot of absolute crap infotainment.\n\n> If you\'re a criminal, right or left, you need to be punished for it. nobody would be cheering for manafort... no matter who he worked for or what party he aligned himself with.\n\nI agree. The question now is, what will people do if this trail of corruption leads right up to the Oval Office? Personally, I don\'t expect Trump supporters to flip on him. His hardcore base gathers in echo chambers, so I expect them to double down on conspiracy theories. I hope like hell that I am wrong, but I don\'t think I am.'

'Yes but if Trump had to flee to Russia because the jig was up, then he would have essentially failed in his mandate. Therefore, Putin would make an example out of his failure because giving him a nice retirement in Russia would tell all the others he backs that he accepts failure. This completely goes against the ruthless pragmatist that Putin is. So I highly doubt that would be the case for Trump. He will most likely be stuck in the US and suffer the consequences. Hope he enjoys keeping Gitmo open when he ends up there for life!'

This forces a lot of people, who previously may have spent time reading comments that further illuminated the original story, to just give up.

"**Spoliation of evidence**\n\nThe spoliation of evidence is the intentional, reckless, or negligent withholding, hiding, altering, fabricating, or destroying of evidence relevant to a legal proceeding. Spoliation has three possible consequences: in jurisdictions where the (intentional) act is criminal by statute, it may result in fines and incarceration (if convicted in a separate criminal proceeding) for the parties who engaged in the spoliation; in jurisdictions where relevant case law precedent has been established, proceedings possibly altered by spoliation may be interpreted under a spoliation inference, or by other corrective measures, depending on the jurisdiction; in some jurisdictions the act of spoliation can itself be an actionable tort.\n\nThe spoliation inference is a negative evidentiary inference that a finder of fact can draw from a party's destruction of a document or thing that is relevant to an ongoing or reasonably foreseeable civil or criminal proceeding: the finder of fact can review all evidence uncovered in as strong a light as possible against the spoliator and in favor of the opposing party.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28"
'Every intelligence report or government statement on the hacking, even Obama himself, have all said since 2016 that the Russians didn\'t break into voting systems and alter the vote, and I\'ve never believed them.  I think the Feds know they did, but that the shame and consequences (pure, unmitigated chaos) of admitting it would have been too damaging. Some of those shot callers probably now wonder whether Trump\'s presidency has been as damaging as admitting that Russia hacked the vote count would have been.  You have to think soberly about what would have happened (or will happen) if the federal government had said "Hey, Trump didn\'t really win Michigan and Wisconsin or the election."

'We all know the mechanism that\'s keeping Trump in place. Republican politicians are caught between two contrasting entities here.\n\nThere\'s the billionaire donor class who fund their reelection attempts. They want tax cuts, decimation of the welfare state and a massive rollback of business and environment regulation. (Along with huge, juicy government contracts for preferred bidders.) Trump is just the turkey to provide such obscene material gifts to the super-rich. At the expense of ordinary working Americans of course.\n\nSecondly there\'s a working and middle class Republican base that regards Trump as the answer to all their problems. (Whether financial, social or religious.) Fox News and their ilk of course tend to keep these supporters in line and on the Trump train. \n\nThe billionaire business class are for all intents and purpose sociopathic. Whether that\'s psychological or just a reflection of our hyper-capitalistic economic model is irrelevant for the time being. They\'re beyond reaching. Which leaves us with the Republican voter base...\n\nThe absolute last thing to do is dismiss these people as somehow stupid or uneducated. It might be a simple aphorism but "you catch more flies with honey than vinegar" is an absolute time-tested truth. You don\'t talk someone down from a ledge by telling them how stupid they are. \n\nIt\'s time to chip around the edges of the Republican base. Particularly with the mid-term elections just months away. Firing up the Democratic base is one thing but understanding the needs, desires and concerns of centrists voters and reluctant Trump voters might well be the key to the Democrats retaking both houses come November.

"Small towns have been collapsing for decades.  And for decades, the only party looking them in the eye and giving them an explanation has been the Republicans.  It's a lie, and a scam, but they've at least acknowledged them.  The Democrats, conversely, know that it's just a natural process of industrialization and the resultant urbanization, and have let it go.  The Republicans are literally the ones making it worse for them, but at least they're acknowledging it.  Of course those populations overwhelmingly turned to them as their only hope.\n\nProgressives are unquestionably the future of the Democratic Party.  People right now act flabbergasted that Bernie's rally in Kansas had such incredible turnout, but they shouldn't be.  Of course it would.  The Democrats are the only ones capable of actually helping working class people.  They just need to realize that a ton of the working poor in this country live on the outskirts, and start addressing them, just as Bernie has.  Again, they've put their faith in these lies because they've been told only lies, and they've heard nothing to contrary.  We need more Democrats like Bernie out there addressing them, and recognizing that their struggle is real, and that it's only as bad as it is because the Republicans are abusing them."

Whether a court/Congress would believe that to be reasonable doubt is questionable. It's the same reason that Trump's admission on live TV that he fired Comey because of Russia can have reasonable doubt. \n\n"

'I tried to step back for a second last night and think about all of this from a historical context and what kind of precedence (or "presidents" if you\'re Trump) this sets. Trump\'s ascension along with the series of scandals in its wake just seems so far beyond the pale of normalcy. \n\nMy concern is that removing Trump from office via impeachment or  through elections, will not restore order to our institutions and government. We\'ve crossed the bridge and burned it down. Even if Trump is gone, we have a sizable population of people that are fiercely loyal to Trump as a person, as well as his tactics and political philosophy. That is a major problem. The institutions, checks and balances  and civil order that our nation is founded upon is under attack - removing a President will not shore up the systematic framework of the nation; it will still be on fire.\n\nAbraham Lincoln\'s Lyceum Address has been echoing in my head during the election and throughout Trump\'s first year in office:\n\n> "Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow? Never! All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not by force take a drink from the Ohio or make a track on the Blue Ridge in a trial of a thousand years. At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer. If it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us; it cannot come from abroad. **If destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen we must live through all time or die by suicide.**"\n\nLets hope we are able to recover, both institutionally as well as a community of people, from the divide that we find ourselves in currently.'

">“Let him arrest me,” Nunberg said.\n\n Nunberg doesn't seem to understand how the law works. When he does not show up on Friday the Judge will issue a bench warrant and the US Marshals will arrest him.\n\nMueller won't have anything to do with it.\n\nIt will be the Judge who issued the subpoena, not Mueller, who will be pissed as shit at  Nunberg and since it will be the judge who decides what happens to him next I simply just can't wait."
'He got interviewed by Mueller the other day, so the thinking here is that what he said to Mueller and what are in his emails may not quite jibe with each other. Contempt of court may not seem so bad compared to perjury and whatever else may come from his emails.'
'Does anyone else find it weird how he says "emails going back to november between me and roger stone, steve bannon"\n\nHe says it so many times its almost like he is trying to signal something. He jumps back and forth on the russia issue then says something did probably happen.\n\nEither he is terrified of all the illegal shit he has done or he is trying to tell Bannon and Stone something. \n'
"He's taking the least risky path. Being jailed for contempt is probably light in comparison to what Mueller will find with his communications. \n\nHe said Roger Stone is his mentor. Can you imagine how many criminal schemes they must have discussed since 2015? \n\nSharing those correspondences is basically giving the prosecutor license to jail anyway.\n\nExpect this guy to make a deal. "
"He was, it's on youtubes cnn channel. Apparently yesterday he was fine with it, then when he was going through his emails he decided not to. In other words, he read some of his old emails and realised just how screwed he is. So he's in a blind panic."

"Ignoring a grand jury summons is very stupid. It's a court order. Violating a court order is contempt of court. One of Mueller's people can now set the ball rolling for U.S. Marshals to pick Nunberg up and take him before the grand jury. If he still refuses to answer questions, he's taken before the judge, who will then command him to answer questions. If he still refuses, then the judge will find him in contempt and almost certainly order him into custody."

Congress is slightly less infected with these RINO types than the Senate, but there are not too many national-level politicians who aren't a part of the same system. You need to break out of the false dichotomy of the two party system. Even a lot of Trump supporters (most of them?) have fallen into this trap.\n\nThey ultimately have the same goal for the direction of our country. One party establishment might campaign on decreasing your tax half a percent, the other might want to increase it half a percent. One might be pro-choice, the other might be pro-life, but on the issues that matter to the uniparty end goals, they're the same. Illusion of choice.\n\nThey both want us in endless proxy wars.

It\'s laughable you think she\'d resort to something as dramatic and obvious as having someone murdered when her entire career is built on being a subtle political operator.\n\nConcerning your allegations of Satanism, well you gotta know your audience.

In all honesty, I've been thinking of forgetting about politics all together. It does nothing but make me want to die. I've supported Hillary, I've supported Trump, I've opposed both Hillary and Trump at one point. Now I oppose them both and everyone who cares to ever read what I write just says I'm an idiot.

No attorney in the world would let their client speak with the prosecutor- doing otherwise would be tantamount to malpractice or ineffective assistance of counsel. This is fake media drama to fill time until Mueller actually makes his move.

He's not doing that, he's doing the exact opposite.\n\nOf course if I was guilty of these things and worse, then I would obstruct, muddy and re-direct the discussion. "

Good luck fixing that easily, especially with the economy (which has nothing to do with Trump) getting better.\n\nEven if it was proven that he colluded I don’t know if he’ll lose support. Many Americans will shrug their shoulders and go “So what”.

'This is from late 2015, preceding Trump\'s rise in the republican spotlight.\n\nMeaning it isn\'t Trump voters, it was republican voters in general. Which is even more depressing if you think about it. Many Trump voters "came out of the woodworks" for Trump that never politically participated before the 2016 election. Meaning this poll was taken before Trump dumbed the party down.\n\n30% of republican voters wanting to bomb a fictional country from a Disney cartoon was the conservative base at its pre-Trump *intellectual height.*\n\n-----\n\nSOURCES FROM GOOGLE -\n\n\n[A Lot of Americans Support Bombing the Fictional Country from Aladdin](http://time.com/4155228/amiercans-bomb-aladdin-agrabah/) - December 18, 2015 - TIME Magazine\n\n[Political ignorance and bombing Agrabah](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/12/18/political-ignorance-and-bombing-agrabah/?utm_term=.78b28e27ab95) - December 18, 2015 - Washington Post'

'all of those videos on both sides are poaching the worst responses for their compilations. they\'re worthless. But this is a poll. Meaning we have the bad AND good results. there\'s a difference between not knowing about a situation with regards to "should the president of ____ country issue an apology" (with no context) "uh.... yes?" and "hey here\'s an islamic sounding country you never heard of. should we bomb the literal country" "sure i dont see why not". Thats actually fucked up '
"Sure. Or 30 percent possibly confused agrabah with another name they knew. Or maybe 15% just wanna bomb the middle east  and the rest had fully reasoned but confused explanations from their answer.\n\nYou just can't infer a whole lot from this data without revealing your bias"

Just what reddit needs, another sub to circle jerk to MSM lies while ignoring the inevitable "clarifications" that follow (which of course corrects the original lie).  So you either have the one insanely pro Trump sub to choose from or the rest of reddit which is insanely anti Trump with no middle ground. Well maybe /r/libertarian actually.

"See, the Right likes to bring up the founding fathers all the time, but this is what the founding fathers were ACTUALLY worried about: they were worried about a king who had enough power to bully the citizens and bankrupt the country with no one who could make him stop. Back in those days, it wasn't the constitutional monarchy like England has now. It was a king who was very powerful and a parliament who had some power, but still had to bow to the king's will in many different matters. He was no simple figurehead. \n\nIf Trump does fire Mueller, we must impeach because Trump will be acting as if he's a king. Not just because what he's doing is illegal, but because the thing he's doing is illegal *because absolute monarchy is illegal*. "
'I think often over the dumb patriot movement that was justified by crazy right wing conspiracies over Obama FEMA death camps, Obama turning the police into a military to declare martial law etc. This lead to to a whole demographic fantasizing over this idea of being the next "patriots" to take up arms against a "tyrannical" government. Spending their retirement, and creating debt to invest in prepping for a walking dead scenario (without Zombies) and a civil war. These people want a civil war.

'Read "A Higher Loyalty" by James Comey.  This is the guy who locked up Martha Stewart and plenty of others because he firmly believes that nobody should be above the law, and was willing to go to great lengths to make examples of people for this.\n\nTo paraphrase the section on Hillary, everyone working on the case, "to a man," was convinced they didn\'t have a case against her.  Not only that, but even if she was found guilty of anything other than obstruction, she wouldn\'t have been put in jail; just lost access to confidential information in the future and/or fired from a job she no longer had.'
"Do you know anyone in your field of work who's been in jail for a similar offense? Because I highly doubt you'd be in jail for a mistake. \n\n The reason Hillary didn't go to jail is because there was no proof of intent. She's been thoroughly investigated all at the expense of millions in taxpayers money and dragging her through courts would just be a waste of time since you're not getting a conviction. It's the same reason why Nixon didn't go to jail, why bush didn't go to jail, or any of the bankers after the financial crisis.\n\nIt's fine to ask questions, but one must wonder why anyone even gives a shit about a private server then use that to call her corrupt.  "
'I missed the sarcasm. My bad. '
"Not personally, no. The worst I've seen are people who've been fired and can never get a clearance again. That's for mishandling information, that is. Now that I look at the wall and the cases we're taught, I see the crimes were not for mishandling information--but rather for purposeful acts by insider threats. \n\nI must be wrong then about the disconnect between myself and people like Hillary. What she did isn't in the same category as willfull leaking."
"No, this is a valid concern I've had since the election. I voted for Bernie in the primary here in Utah because I couldn't stomach Hilary or any of the Republican candidates. And since there are laws against voting in more than primary in Utah, I chose to vote for the candidate I liked most. In the general election I voted for McMullen because he was my best choice between the three. I hate Trump, but I also dislike Hilary. It doesn't mean I can't identify when someone makes a misdrection while still disliking both people. \n\nCouldn't you have at least gone throughy profile before calling me a bot?

I think she nearly hasn’t got a conscience for the lies she’s shoving on the American public for this administration... but that said, there’s not really any indication that she specifically has done anything illegal, right?'
"I would certainly agree with that. I'm happy to be wrong about some crime I don't know she also committed, but other than being a garbage human, she's not a criminal. \n\nRemember when White House counsel Don mcgahn threatened to quit after Trump ordered him to fire Mueller? (Holy shit the fact that I say it like that and it isn't on the tip of everybody's tongue just shows you how much chaos there is). McGahn knew he could be implicated in obstruction of justice. Of course it's possible that Sanders could be in a similar situation in terms of being ordered to commit a crime. If her boss tells her to do that, and she commits the crime, then she would be just as liable as Trump himself."
"If, for example, she's in the room when they discuss obstruction of justice, and she doesn't take that info straight to the fbi, she's an accessory to obstruction and guilty of failing to report a crime. That's about all I've got though. "
'I don’t understand your question.\n\nI’m not saying she hasn’t done anything wrong. Misleading the American people in dystopian fashion by spreading lies and propaganda for this deluded President is unquestionably “wrong”.\n\nBut lying to the press isn’t illegal or indictable. Because we have the rule of law, you don’t go to jail just for being an asshole. (Thank god too, because I couldn’t handle it in prison :-/ )'
"Exactly. There could also be scenarios where she is a part of the meetings when they are brainstorming issues with Comey related to the Russia investigation. If the Trump Administration coaches her not to discuss those conversations about the firing of Comey, that's also obstruction. She can lie to the press and the public about why the firing occurred. But if Mueller wants to sit down with her and she fails to disclose other conversations then she can be implicated as well. And of course there's a potential paper trail of memos or talking points to be investigated."

I'd read the WSJ if I wanted market news a day too late.\n\n\n\n\nMy main aggravation stems from this play the victim type mentality that members of the media have but the moment they step back into the safety of their choosen liberal or progressive enclaves they pander back to their base.  Often by making normal everday folks who simply aren't liberal or left out to be racist xenophobic gun wielding boogey men.\n\nIt's bull shit and while not every member of the media does that shit.

And there are multiple plea deals which, at the very least, indicate the buck has not stopped rising up the ladder yet.

The closest you have is Campaign volunteer Papadopoulos trying to shop around a meeting with Putin that was rejected by the campaign.\n\nFalse. 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies were indicted on conspiracy charges, with some also being accused of identity theft. The charges related to a Russian propaganda effort designed to interfere with the 2016 campaign. The companies involved are the Internet Research Agency, often described as a “Russian troll farm,” and two other companies that helped finance it. The Russian nationals indicted include 12 of the agency’s employees and its alleged financier, Yevgeny Prigozhin.\n\n> Sure. They like chaos. And they concluded, not proved. And, this has nothing to do with Trump.\n\nThey proved that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump.

Four Americans died. Even the State Department Accountability Review Board report that many Republicans say is a whitewash is unsparing in its portrait of Washington’s indifference to the crumbling security situation. **The report said the security posture was “grossly inadequate” to deal with the attacks:**\n\n> “The number of Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) security staff in Benghazi on the day of the attack and in the months and weeks leading up to it was inadequate, **despite repeated requests from Special Mission Benghazi and Embassy Tripoli for additional staffing. Board members found a pervasive realization among personnel who served in Benghazi that the Special Mission was not a high priority for Washington when it came to security-related requests**, especially those relating to staffing. \n\n>The **insufficient Special Mission security platform was at variance with the appropriate Overseas Security Policy Board (OSPB) standards with respect to perimeter and interior security. Benghazi was also severely under-resourced with regard to certain needed security equipment, although DS funded and installed in 2012 a number of physical security upgrades.”**\n\nAlso, from [the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/state-dept-downgraded-security-in-libya-before-deadly-attack-ex-officer-claims/2012/10/10/d7195faa-12e6-11e2-a16b-2c110031514a_story.html?utm_term=.370042dcbc4f)\n\n>The **State Department acknowledged Wednesday that it rejected appeals for more security at its diplomatic posts in Libya** in the months before a fatal terrorist attack in Benghazi as Republicans suggested that lapses contributed to the deaths of the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.\nMilitary response during attacks:\n\nFrom [Military.com](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2016/06/28/benghazi-probe-finds-marines-response-slowed-uniform-changes.html)\n\n>Among these were delays imposed on the 50-man Marine Fleet Anti-terrorism Security Team, or FAST, which launched from Rota, Spain, more than 2,000 miles away from Benghazi. **The team was loaded onto C-130 aircraft, but held on the ground for three hours before being allowed to take off.**\n\n> According to the report, Navy Vice Adm. Kurt Tidd, then-director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified that the **State Department had dithered about how to send forces into Libya without creating a larger international incident.**\n\n>The Marine commander of the FAST platoon, unnamed in the report, testified that the Marines\' orders changed constantly as they waited to depart.\n\n>"We were told **multiple times to change what we were wearing, to change from cammies into civilian attire, civilian attire into cammies, cammies into civilian attire**," he said. "There was also **some talk of whether or not we could carry our personal weapons. ** I was basically holding hard and fast to the point where we were carrying our personal weapons. Like, we\'ve got a very violent thing going on the ground where we\'re going, so we\'re going to be carrying something that can protect ourselves."\n\n>Ultimately, the commander said, the **Marines would change in and out of uniform four times.**\n\n>"Although [then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army Gen. Martin] Dempsey told the U.S. Senate that once forces began moving, \'nothing stopped us, nothing slowed us,\' it appears the U.S. Military\'s response that night was delayed -- because it started too late" \n\n>It remains unclear whether the three-hour delay made a difference in the fast-moving events of that night in Libya. Ultimately, the FAST Marines were never ordered to Benghazi\n\nUSA Today:\n\n>The [House GOP Benghazi] report also sheds new light on previous conclusions that the military was unable to respond quickly enough to perform a rescue. The Republicans found that "despite President Obama and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta’s clear orders to deploy military assets, nothing was sent to Benghazi, and **nothing was en route to Libya at the time the last two Americans were killed almost 8 hours after the attacks began.**"\n\n[Timeline of events](https://www.lifezette.com/polizette/where-was-the-military-during-benghazi/), verified but in a less clear fashion [from Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-libya-pentagon/pentagon-releases-benghazi-timeline-defends-response-idUSBRE8A903U20121110).\n\n> * The attack began at 9:42 p.m. local time, or 3:42 p.m. Washington time.\n> *    At 4:32 p.m., the Pentagon\'s National Military Center as notified of the attack.\n\n>* At 6:34 p.m., terrorists began attacking the CIA annex.\n> * At about 7 p.m., roughly 2.5 hours after the National Military Center was notified, then-Secretary of Defense Leon  Panetta ordered three different units deployed: The Marine Fleet Anti-Terrorism Support Team, or FAST; a Commanders In Extremis Force, or "CIF;" and a hostage rescue team based in the United States.\n> *    At 10:15 p.m., terrorists killed Stevens.\n> *    At 10 a.m. the next morning — 18 hours later after the attack began — the FAST Platoon finally took off from Spain.\n> *    At about 11 a.m., the CIF took off.\n> *    At about 2 p.m., the CIF arrived at a staging base.\n> *    At 2:56 p.m., the FAST team arrived in Tripoli.\n> *    At 3:28 p.m., a Special Operations Force deployed from the United States arrived at a staging base.\n\n> The report describes discussions about how military personnel should respond. The FAST platoon sat on a plane in Rota, Spain, for three hours and changed in and out of their uniforms four times as officials vacillated on minute details. The State Department insisted the military respond in civilian clothing and in vehicles without military markings — out of an apparent concern for offending the Libyan government.\n\n> should i take the time to dig up the proof that you are lying? i don\'t see why.\n\n\nI know why.  Because there is no proof, because everything I\'ve said is verifiably true in the public record.  I\'m sorry if you\'re not happy with the truth.

I don't desire to see Hillary Clinton in jail, that doesn't accomplish anything.  I believe it cost her the chance to be President (appropriately), which is punishment enough.

Here is the answer. **The left starts counting Mr. Obama’s deficit meter in 2010, after he passed the $800 billion debt bomb fiscal stimulus bill.**\n\n>So they assigned the gargantuan deficit in Mr. Obama’s first year to Mr. Bush....  it is true that the deficit was going to be much higher ... because of the deep recession that ended in June 2009. So in fairness some of the bad number in 2009 was Bush’s fault.\n\n> But Mr. **Obama made the deficit hundreds of billions of dollars worse with a stimulus plan that by the administration’s own admission didn’t create a single new job.

The prosecution must merely show that Lee acted willfully: i.e., aware that his conduct was illegal, he intentionally retained classified information in a place not authorized for its storage (and during a time when he was no longer authorized to possess it).  \n\nLee is facing life in prison, for the exact same crime we **know** Hillary committed. \n\n[McCabe, lying to the FBI, while under oath:](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/01/mishandling-classified-material-former-cia-agent-case-compares-clinton/)\n \n>The new report from the Justice Department inspector general concludes that **Andrew McCabe, the former FBI deputy director, lied to then-FBI Director James Comey, to other FBI agents, and to officials of the Office of the Inspector General. Some of those lies came when McCabe was under oath.**\n\n> The inspector general has completed his work. The question now is, will the Justice Department prosecute McCabe? Or, put another way: Will the FBI and the Justice Department follow the same rules they apply to members of the public who lie to a federal agent?\n\n> Remember, the only charge brought against Gen. Michael Flynn, the former national security advisor to President Donald Trump, was lying to the FBI, a felony. And Flynn wasn’t even under oath when he supposedly lied to the FBI.\n\nI see no need to do the rest, as I doubt you really care.

They can ask them any questions and short of pleading the 5th (publicly admitting you comited a crime should make for *amazing* re-election attack ads), the witness has to answer of be held in contempt of Congress. *Edit*: Even pleading the fifth just results the grant of *use immunity* as we just saw with [the Manafort trial](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/23/five-witnesses-given-immunity-in-paul-manafort-case.html).  Good luck explaining yourself Nunes. Who else should we call? Perhaps the guys who asked Rosenstein to draft his memo supporting the firing of Comey? Seems reasonable. \n\n2. The House becomes the prosecution in this trial. And if the majority of people voting to impeach on the house don\'t actually support impeachment or conviction in the Senate - the public will get treated to a satirical fiasco of a case. Very few people would be available to meet a prosecution and an openly sham trial could be used to expose how painfully thin the "witch hunt" case is which would provide a nice contrast to the impending Trump Impeachment case. \n\n3.

And fun fact, in Fire and Fury, Bannon claimed that Cohen paid off over a hundred women... so, I’m looking forward to whatever the FBI finds in his office relating to these payments). \n\nThus, I think it is offensive to lawyers who advocate for clients in the trial-space and in (truly) heated mediations to call Cohen a “lawyer.” He should be called a “pseudo-lawyer” or just a consigliere.

"I don't think there should be a coup but I don't think it's far-fetched to think about what the military will do if Trump orders them to do something stupid. If he orders air strikes on Tehran, does Mattis have to do it?"
'Still, somebody has to be arrested; in fact, I would choose to be cops and the FBI and not the military. You know Trump will refuse to step down. :( If Trump were to somehow become a "president" (Read: Dictator) for more than 8 years, then yes, a coup would be a necessity.'
'I think it will take a bit more than that to reach that point. Basically, if you think of both that oath and the second amendment; the requirement for violent action when the government evokes something that will stop people from speaking. Meaning people in the streets with guns to force your silence or secret police. There is no sign of that at this moment, his current defense against them is two fold. Despite what you think, there is still many high ranking members of the military that will not agree to these types of actions. Secondly, the DoJ is separate for the White House, so there should be the ability to hold Trump accountable, and at the very least vote him out.   '
'Mattis would have to resign. The Joint Chiefs could refuse an illegal order, along with every officer below them. The question is, would they see it as an illegal order? And would they have the balls to say no, since they would almost certainly be arrested for insubordination by somebody.'

I have already been there with that bastard, and I am a better person for it. Nixon had the unique ability to make his enemies seem honorable, and we developed a keen sense of fraternity. Some of my best friends have hated Nixon all their lives. My mother hates Nixon, my son hates Nixon, I hate Nixon, and this hatred has brought us together.\nNixon laughed when I told him this. "Don\'t worry," he said, "I, too, am a family man, and we feel the same way about you."\nIt was Richard Nixon who got me into politics, and now that he\'s gone, I feel lonely. He was a giant in his way. As long as Nixon was politically alive -- and he was, all the way to the end -- we could always be sure of finding the enemy on the Low Road. There was no need to look anywhere else for the evil bastard. He had the fighting instincts of a badger trapped by hounds. The badger will roll over on its back and emit a smell of death, which confuses the dogs and lures them in for the traditional ripping and tearing action. But it is usually the badger who does the ripping and tearing. It is a beast that fights best on its back: rolling under the throat of the enemy and seizing it by the head with all four claws.\nThat was Nixon\'s style -- and if you forgot, he would kill you as a lesson to the others. Badgers don\'t fight fair, bubba. That\'s why God made dachshunds.\n\nNixon was a navy man, and he should have been buried at sea. Many of his friends were seagoing people: Bebe Rebozo, Robert Vesco, William F. Buckley Jr., and some of them wanted a full naval burial.\nThese come in at least two styles, however, and Nixon\'s immediate family strongly opposed both of them. In the traditionalist style, the dead president\'s body would be wrapped and sewn loosely in canvas sailcloth and dumped off the stern of a frigate at least 100 miles off the coast and at least 1,000 miles south of San Diego, so the corpse could never wash up on American soil in any recognizable form.\nThe family opted for cremation until they were advised of the potentially onerous implications of a strictly private, unwitnessed burning of the body of the man who was, after all, the President of the United States. Awkward questions might be raised, dark allusions to Hitler and Rasputin. People would be filing lawsuits to get their hands on the dental charts. Long court battles would be inevitable -- some with liberal cranks bitching about corpus delicti and habeas corpus and others with giant insurance companies trying not to pay off on his death benefits. Either way, an orgy of greed and duplicity was sure to follow any public hint that Nixon might have somehow faked his own death or been cryogenically transferred to fascist Chinese interests on the Central Asian Mainland.\nIt would also play into the hands of those millions of self-stigmatized patriots like me who believe these things already.\n\nIf the right people had been in charge of Nixon\'s funeral, his casket would have been launched into one of those open-sewage canals that empty into the ocean just south of Los Angeles. He was a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president. Nixon was so crooked that he needed servants to help him screw his pants on every morning. Even his funeral was illegal. He was queer in the deepest way. His body should have been burned in a trash bin.\nThese are harsh words for a man only recently canonized by President Clinton and my old friend George McGovern -- but I have written worse things about Nixon, many times, and the record will show that I kicked him repeatedly long before he went down. I beat him like a mad dog with mange every time I got a chance, and I am proud of it. He was scum.\nLet there be no mistake in the history books about that. Richard Nixon was an evil man -- evil in a way that only those who believe in the physical reality of the Devil can understand it. He was utterly without ethics or morals or any bedrock sense of decency. Nobody trusted him -- except maybe the Stalinist Chinese, and honest historians will remember him mainly as a rat who kept scrambling to get back on the ship.\nIt is fitting that Richard Nixon\'s final gesture to the American people was a clearly illegal series of 21 105-mm howitzer blasts that shattered the peace of a residential neighborhood and permanently disturbed many children. Neighbors also complained about another unsanctioned burial in the yard at the old Nixon place, which was brazenly illegal. "It makes the whole neighborhood like a graveyard," said one. "And it fucks up my children\'s sense of values."\n\nMany were incensed about the howitzers -- but they knew there was nothing they could do about it -- not with the current president sitting about 50 yards away and laughing at the roar of the cannons. It was Nixon\'s last war, and he won.\nThe funeral was a dreary affair, finely staged for TV and shrewdly dominated by ambitious politicians and revisionist historians. The Rev. Billy Graham, still agile and eloquent at the age of 136, was billed as the main speaker, but he was quickly upstaged by two 1996 GOP presidential candidates: Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas and Gov. Pete Wilson of California, who formally hosted the event and saw his poll numbers crippled when he got blown off the stage by Dole, who somehow seized the No. 3 slot on the roster and uttered such a shameless, self-serving eulogy that even he burst into tears at the end of it.\nDole\'s stock went up like a rocket and cast him as the early GOP front-runner for \'96. Wilson, speaking next, sounded like an Engelbert Humperdinck impersonator and probably won\'t even be re-elected as governor of California in November.\nThe historians were strongly represented by the No. 2 speaker, Henry Kissinger, Nixon\'s secretary of state and himself a zealous revisionist with many axes to grind. He set the tone for the day with a maudlin and spectacularly self-serving portrait of Nixon as even more saintly than his mother and as a president of many godlike accomplishments -- most of them put together in secret by Kissinger, who came to California as part of a huge publicity tour for his new book on diplomacy, genius, Stalin, H. P. Lovecraft and other great minds of our time, including himself and Richard Nixon.\n\n'
"There is no way in hell trump will resign with dignity.\n\nThey're physically going to have to drag him out of the office.  But I'm pretty sure he'll start a conflict somewhere before that happens"
'Kissinger was only one of the many historians who suddenly came to see Nixon as more than the sum of his many squalid parts. He seemed to be saying that History will not have to absolve Nixon, because he has already done it himself in a massive act of will and crazed arrogance that already ranks him supreme, along with other Nietzschean supermen like Hitler, Jesus, Bismarck and the Emperor Hirohito. These revisionists have catapulted Nixon to the status of an American Caesar, claiming that when the definitive history of the 20th century is written, no other president will come close to Nixon in stature. "He will dwarf FDR and Truman," according to one scholar from Duke University.\nIt was all gibberish, of course. Nixon was no more a Saint than he was a Great President. He was more like Sammy Glick than Winston Churchill. He was a cheap crook and a merciless war criminal who bombed more people to death in Laos and Cambodia than the U.S. Army lost in all of World War II, and he denied it to the day of his death. When students at Kent State University, in Ohio, protested the bombing, he connived to have them attacked and slain by troops from the National Guard.\nSome people will say that words like scum and rotten are wrong for Objective Journalism -- which is true, but they miss the point. It was the built-in blind spots of the Objective rules and dogma that allowed Nixon to slither into the White House in the first place. He looked so good on paper that you could almost vote for him sight unseen. He seemed so all-American, so much like Horatio Alger, that he was able to slip through the cracks of Objective Journalism. You had to get Subjective to see Nixon clearly, and the shock of recognition was often painful.\n\nNixon\'s meteoric rise from the unemployment line to the vice presidency in six quick years would never have happened if TV had come along 10 years earlier. He got away with his sleazy "my dog Checkers" speech in 1952 because most voters heard it on the radio or read about it in the headlines of their local, Republican newspapers. When Nixon finally had to face the TV cameras for real in the 1960 presidential campaign debates, he got whipped like a red-headed mule. Even die-hard Republican voters were shocked by his cruel and incompetent persona. Interestingly, most people who heard those debates on the radio thought Nixon had won. But the mushrooming TV audience saw him as a truthless used-car salesman, and they voted accordingly. It was the first time in 14 years that Nixon lost an election.\nWhen he arrived in the White House as VP at the age of 40, he was a smart young man on the rise -- a hubris-crazed monster from the bowels of the American dream with a heart full of hate and an overweening lust to be President. He had won every office he\'d run for and stomped like a Nazi on all of his enemies and even some of his friends.\nNixon had no friends except George Will and J. Edgar Hoover (and they both deserted him). It was Hoover\'s shameless death in 1972 that led directly to Nixon\'s downfall. He felt helpless and alone with Hoover gone. He no longer had access to either the Director or the Director\'s ghastly bank of Personal Files on almost everybody in Washington.\n\nHoover was Nixon\'s right flank, and when he croaked, Nixon knew how Lee felt when Stonewall Jackson got killed at Chancellorsville. It permanently exposed Lee\'s flank and led to the disaster at Gettysburg.\nFor Nixon, the loss of Hoover led inevitably to the disaster of Watergate. It meant hiring a New Director -- who turned out to be an unfortunate toady named L. Patrick Gray, who squealed like a pig in hot oil the first time Nixon leaned on him. Gray panicked and fingered White House Counsel John Dean, who refused to take the rap and rolled over, instead, on Nixon, who was trapped like a rat by Dean\'s relentless, vengeful testimony and went all to pieces right in front of our eyes on TV.\nThat is Watergate, in a nut, for people with seriously diminished attention spans. The real story is a lot longer and reads like a textbook on human treachery. They were all scum, but only Nixon walked free and lived to clear his name. Or at least that\'s what Bill Clinton says -- and he is, after all, the President of the United States.\nNixon liked to remind people of that. He believed it, and that was why he went down. He was not only a crook but a fool. Two years after he quit, he told a TV journalist that "if the president does it, it can\'t be illegal."\nShit. Not even Spiro Agnew was that dumb. He was a flat-out, knee-crawling thug with the morals of a weasel on speed. But he was Nixon\'s vice president for five years, and he only resigned when he was caught red-handed taking cash bribes across his desk in the White House.\n\nUnlike Nixon, Agnew didn\'t argue. He quit his job and fled in the night to Baltimore, where he appeared the next morning in U.S. District Court, which allowed him to stay out of prison for bribery and extortion in exchange for a guilty (no contest) plea on income-tax evasion. After that he became a major celebrity and played golf and tried to get a Coors distributorship. He never spoke to Nixon again and was an unwelcome guest at the funeral. They called him Rude, but he went anyway. It was one of those Biological Imperatives, like salmon swimming up waterfalls to spawn before they die. He knew he was scum, but it didn\'t bother him.\nAgnew was the Joey Buttafuoco of the Nixon administration, and Hoover was its Caligula. They were brutal, brain-damaged degenerates worse than any hit man out of The Godfather, yet they were the men Richard Nixon trusted most. Together they defined his Presidency.\nIt would be easy to forget and forgive Henry Kissinger of his crimes, just as he forgave Nixon. Yes, we could do that -- but it would be wrong. Kissinger is a slippery little devil, a world-class hustler with a thick German accent and a very keen eye for weak spots at the top of the power structure. Nixon was one of those, and Super K exploited him mercilessly, all the way to the end.\nKissinger made the Gang of Four complete: Agnew, Hoover, Kissinger and Nixon. A group photo of these perverts would say all we need to know about the Age of Nixon.\nNixon\'s spirit will be with us for the rest of our lives -- whether you\'re me or Bill Clinton or you or Kurt Cobain or Bishop Tutu or Keith Richards or Amy Fisher or Boris Yeltsin\'s daughter or your fiancee\'s 16-year-old beer-drunk brother with his braided goatee and his whole life like a thundercloud out in front of him. This is not a generational thing. You don\'t even have to know who Richard Nixon was to be a victim of his ugly, Nazi spirit.\nHe has poisoned our water forever. Nixon will be remembered as a classic case of a smart man shitting in his own nest. But he also shit in our nests, and that was the crime that history will burn on his memory like a brand. By disgracing and degrading the Presidency of the United States, by fleeing the White House like a diseased cur, Richard Nixon broke the heart of the American Dream.'

This is an investigation, not a witch hunt.  \n\nOh, and sorry that someone isn’t good at talking, maybe they shouldn’t be in a public office where they are required to speak a lot.

'Links Between Trump associates and Russian Officials -Wikipedia\n\n\nRoger Stone\n\n>Roger J.

"Agreed, government officials constantly plead guilty to crimes for no reason, happens all the time, Mueller didn't have anything to do with it..."
"GOP will not do it. It's pointless to keep this up until the Dems move in. The more people the GOP screw over in the meantime, the more seats will flip. Unfortunately this is how it seems to work. A lot of people have to have personally been wronged before they'll vote for change. Empathy for the plight of fellow Americans just does not exist among Republicans. That's why they're Republicans."
'On this, I disagree. There are many reasons Congress should impeach Trump, but he has a constitutional right to withhold his testimony, and under no circumstances should he be punished for exercising that right. It is possible to get rid of Trump without creating a new Star Chamber.'
"He can withhold testimony, but to actually 'plead the 5th' he has to get his ass to court and do so on the stand. Though the law may not be quite so cut and dry for presidents, [this is how it works for your average citizen, as explained by a legal firm's Q&A page](https://www.bostondefenselaw.com/blog/2015/09/i-received-a-subpoena-to-appear-before-a-grand-jury-i-dont-want-to-testify-do-i-have-to-go-cant-i-just-plead-the-5th/). \n\nIf the court thinks you still have to testify, even if you plead the 5th, they can hold you in contempt if you still refuse. [This specific example is for Massachusetts] (https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleII/Chapter233/Section20H) but you'll find that laws for contempt are very similar across jurisdictions. \n\nThanks to the exploits of the Nixon presidency, and the rampant corruption that plagued both he and Agnew, a number of laws and precedents were set so that a president couldn't just weasel out of any charges.  Much like the ones that were set in the impeachment hearings for then President Bill Clinton because *he lied under oath*.  If nothing else (and there's plenty) it's not hard to see a case against trump *when* he eventually has to go before congress, a grand jury, or both. If you want a thorough explaination about the legal implications of lying to congress, read the first dozen pages of the Fusion GPS testimony, they very clearly spell it out. "
"Question:\n\nSo the 5th Amendment doesn't cover civil matters as strongly as criminal ones.  I believe it's possible to infer 5th amendment as an admission of guilt in a civil matter, to some degree.  IANAL.\n\nIf this investigation is just about impeachment and not a criminal prosecution, does 5th amendment apply, and could you infer guilt?"
"It's a criminal investigation. 5th amendment rights apply. Impeachment is a political process. If the votes are there, there is no avenue to appeal."
'Hell yea. That man knows how to visual aid. '
'I know this is going to be very difficult for you to understand so I’ll try to use small words.\n\nHilary Clinton did not become president. She has not had a job in over 5 years. She is 70 years old. She will not be getting a new job. She has no control over anything. No one gives a shit about her. Even if we found out she Was a big mean lady, She can’t be fired because she has no job.\n\nDonald Trump has one of the biggest jobs in the entire world. He controls many things. People care a lot if he is a bad man.'
'Are you talking about that time when Vladimir Putin was reelected president of the Russian Federation in 2012, protests alleging rigging and corruption broke out all over ~~the~~ Russia, and Putin blamed Hillary Clinton -- who was Secretary of State at the time -- for being involved in inciting the protests?'

'I think Trump/Faux news supporters are over saturated with propaganda that they can\'t think for themselves. Even when faced with all the allegations and crimes against Trump, they vehemently deny any wrong doing and victim blame or yell they were "crisis actors". It\'s sickening to think there is an entire population of people that function in our everyday lives like this. I have the misfortune of being related to one of these buffoons and no matter how much evidence is against Trump they will not relent. I\'m not one to put someone on my side, but this is becoming Orwellian "newspeak" in real time.'

'I’ve pretty much given up on trying to convince them of anything.

'
'They victim blame the sexual assault allegations. "If they were so innocent why are they now speaking out?" They believe Trump is a smart business man regardless of any evidence proving otherwise. I mentioned all the failed Trump businesses and facts that the only people that would give him money were shady Russian banks like VEB or Deutche. They don\'t care. I even got into an argument about the economy. I said by removing the bank regulations that will entitle them to make riskier investments and cause more problems just like they did in 2008, and we all know what happened there. It went something like this: \n\nHim: Oh just because he declared bankruptcy 6 times you think he\'s unsuccessful?\nMe: I\'d be successful too if my dad gave me a fortune and I squandered it on a bunch of failed businesses and declared bankruptcy to keep it until the bank seizes the assets. \nHim: Oh so just because YOU think China is going to start a trade war and Nafta it\'s going to screw the economy?\nMe: Yes, exactly why would you try to screw the economy by starting a tariff war? And not to mention alienate your neighbor to the south and one of the biggest traders to the US. \nHim: *ANGRY stare* Trudges off and leaves. '

All of these are things they brought upon themselves because they’re stupid. '
'>James Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a Special Council?\n\nThat is a completely false statement. It is 100% wrong. The special council was appointed because comey was fired, and sessions had ethical conflicts of interest. The investigation that mueller took over had started months prior. \n\n>Therefore, the Special Council was established based on an illegal act\n\nFirst of all, he “leaked” after the special council was appointed. Trump said himself that he fired him because of the Russia investigation and Flynn. Second, there’s nothing illegal about recounting a conversation. It’s not classified or privileged just because it’s with the president. There were no laws broken here. \n\n>Really, does everybody know what that means?\n\nThe rant of a desperate old man who isn’t mentally equipped to deal with a normal job let alone the presidency AND all of the metaphorical alligators that are closing in on him. He’s unraveling. \n\nIn all seriousness, how is a quote from trump your answer? If we were talking about OJ Simpson, would you post a quote from him proclaiming his innocence?

"Collective decision making? No. I never decided to bomb or kill anyone, and I haven't. I am in no way, shape, or form responsible for the evils others have committed.\n\n"
"> You live in a country with a system of collective decision making.\n\nNo we don't.\n\nIt's a lie.\n\nPolitics in USA is as real a professional wrestling or professional sports.

"This is the same logic that Osama Bin Laden used to justify attacks against US citizens / non-combatants.\n\nI don't agree with it for a second because if I oppose everything these people do and have no avenue to stop them, I can't possibly be considered morally culpable. You can't even drop citizenship or leave unless they allow it.\n\nTrue collective decision-making would require that every person have veto power over decisions. I assure you we do not have anything like that."
">but it is still unjust to have a foreign agent in our white house. \n\nTrump isn't a foreign agent. He's just a normal American moron, not some sort of Russian moron.\n\nThe DNC just spread that conspiracy theory so people wouldn't pay attention to how they screwed over Barnie Sandlers and instead focus on something else. \n\n> I know you trolls are spreading that propaganda because all of a sudden my conservative friends are defending Russia when 5 years ago their narrative was the opposite in that Obama was a russianesque socialist.\n\nI'm not a fucking conservative, I'm just a rational human that understands that the most important issue in the *entire fucking world* is making sure that the two largest nuclear super-powers remain best friends. \n\nYou fucking idiots are putting us at a higher risk of nuclear war with your imaginary nonsense. \n\nKnock it off.\n\n"
'Also the same logic used at the Nuremberg trials to prosecute soldiers who were not following orders. Just because osama took the logic to extremes to justify heinous acts against people who only vote a small portion of the liability that doesn’t mean that it’s not still true. '
'We oppose our government and the evils it commits. We would like to not pay taxes, but that would land us in jail and leave our families destitute. If your premise is true, that we are morally responsible for the evils committed by others, even when we openly oppose those evil acts, then why are there still any German people? Should they not all have been executed for the crimes of the 3rd Reich? We are as powerless as you are fighting against this tyrannical evil.'
"> We would like to not pay taxes, but that would land us in jail and leave our families destitute\n\nSo it's okay to pretend that you don't pay for bombs because it would be inconvenient for you not to pay for bombs?\n\nI'm just advocating for an eyes open approach. I don't think you are solely responsible, but I think that we are collectively responsible for the evil that our society commits. \n\nI didn't say that we all bear full and equal responsibility. I don't think that being one of the people who let nazis happen should be a death sentence, just that they shouldn't go through life pretending that they weren't part of it. "
"But there were specific people who didn't have enough power to stop the atrocities themselves who were convicted not for being the ones who made the decisions, but for their place in the machine. As a tax payer and voter you are only a small part of the machine and I wouldn't say that that makes you an evil person, just that this is one of I'm sure many not great things about you. Me too. I don't personally drop bombs on anyone, but I know that when I pay my taxes that is a big part of what I'm paying for."
"I vehemently disagree. \nThe shop vendors in Little Italy that pay extortion payments to the mob are not morally responsible when the mob kills people in a hit. Placing blame on people powerless to take direct action is ridiculous. Collectivist thinking is one of the main problems with U.S. culture. Just because I was born on a specific land mass at a certain time in the history of existence doesn't make me culpable for acts that I do not advocate for.\n\nEven if I move to another country and renounce my U.S. citizenship, I still have to pay out enormous fees and cost that in effect mean I am still paying for the war machine. The is no escaping that we are slaves, and blaming slaves for the actions of the masters is wrong.\n\nPlace the blame squarely on the shoulders of those that support the war State and the military-industrial complex."
'Also, if you did that (move to another country), it could be argued that you would be enabling the US to be even worse, since they would be losing a conscientious objector like yourself. '

"This is a common strategy when attacking witnesses who've flipped. The issue for Trump is that for many of these potential crimes the prosecution won't only be relying on Cohen's statements to make its case. There will be other testimony and documentary evidence supporting these charges. It's possible Cohen will only be providing context and background. In other words if the prosecution is doing its job and the evidence is strong (and most of us think it is) this shouldn't turn into a he said/she said."

It's the main reason why Trump is running scared right now; if you dont believe me, go watch yesterdays response he gave about his personal lawyer being raided and tell me thay's the body language of some whi's confident they are safe.

Russia WANTS for there to be riots.  They will have people in place trying to make it happen.  \nWhen it does it will be an international incident and Trump would declare Martial Law.  \n\nThe elections are only four days before but the Democrats won\'t assume office until January!\n\nPutin will likely have a substantial entourage of Russian spies. \n\nThe 20,000 person (now 35,000) "immigrant detention centers" on military bases are still being built, despite there not being a need for that much capacity.

'George Will did not tell voters to vote for Democrats, and he never will.  Everybody is reporting that he said that, but I challenge you to find a quote that says this.\n\nWhat he said is "vote against Republicans", which is the same thing he said in 2016.\n\nHe hates Trump but not as much as he hates Democrats, which keeps him from supporting the most effective counter to Trump, so he\'s  just covering his fake ass and therefore fuck George Will in his skinny butt forever.'
'Important to note: George Will is an *actual* conservative.  He\'s trash, but he still represents the Republican party of the 20th century before guys like Gingrich, Limbaugh, and Fox News drove the party towards complete insanity.  As much as I might disagree with him, he actually believes in some form of political philosophy, unlike the vast majority of Republicans these days, who simply see it as a brand.\n\nThe real irony is that even though these people are themselves literally Republicans **in name only,** most modern Republicans will call Will the "RINO" and argue that he\'s "not conservative enough," themselves having no concept of what that term actually means.\n\nWhether you agree with him or not, I think the point remains the same: [**GET EVERYONE REGISTERED**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdx39u-dyptjQH-sANKBMv7JbdrzqeT3FkXo7fsVaYyBDuRxw/viewform).

"Nah perjury is the easy one.  Mueller is flipping Trump's associates one at a time to verify other charges, such as international money laundering, conspiracy, treason, etc.\n\nWe all know by now that big daddy Putin owns Trump's orange ass."
'You didn\'t even respond to my post, you ignored it.  Just as you\'re ignoring over 100 charges filed against 19 people in the Mueller investigation thus far.\n\nAnd if **ONE** investigation against Trump is a waste of taxpayer money, then what about the **EIGHT** investigations against Hillary which found nothing?  Hell, what about Trump\'s own funneling of taxpayer money into his bank accounts?  Why aren\'t you more angry/concerned about that if you quote, "don\'t like Trump."  Mueller is the one guy going after Trump and you\'re blind if you think this man doesn\'t have the balls to pull it off in the end.'
'I did respond to it; your point is just easily dismissed.\nYou talking about the pathetic troll farm that posted a few memes? Ok, sure. Do you honestly think that had any meaningful effect on the  election?\nAs far as Flynn, Manafort, etc...I don\'t doubt that they are corrupt. So was Obama\'s cabinet. So was Bush\'s cabinet. And so on. I\'m not arguing that. But let\'s not forget why this whole investigation began--BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS ACCUSED TRUMP OF "COLLUDING" WITH RUSSIANS TO HELP HIM WIN THE ELECTION. There has been 0 evidence so far to support this assertion.\nNow let\'s remember why it\'s still going--BECAUSE PEOPLE PERSONALLY DON\'T LIKE TRUMP. So now we\'re wasting all this time and tax dollars trying to catch him in a lie so we can punish him, and the all-consumed Trump-haters can "win". But when they "win", the American people lose. Because while all this has been going on, we still don\'t have universal healthcare. The rich got another tax break. The Democrats bent themselves over a chair over DACA.\nI think any partisan witchhunt is a waste of time and money. And if you\'re that upset about Trump funneling money, you should be just as upset about Hillary Clinton funneling money through the Clinton Foundation, but I bet you\'re not. And that is some real partisan dishonesty.\nThe main reason this investigation pisses me off, though, is that it stems from the Clinton campaign attempting to divert the blame and attention from the real reason she lost the election--she ran a shitty campaign!!!'
'Yeah, because nobody in the establishment had it out for Obama or Bush. They were PART of the establishment. Gore, Kerry, McCain, Romney did not accuse Bush or Obama of being puppets of a foreign government because THEY ran a shitty campaign and lost. Which is what is happening here--it was an idea hatched by the Clinton campaign. Obama\'s cabinet was a ton of corrupt bankers from Goldman Sachs and Citibank. Bush\'s cabinet contained war criminals. So it\'s only a false equivalency in the sense that nobody had a personal crusade against them.\nProving my point again! The Comey investigation was a direct result of the Clinton campaign\'s accusations of "collusion" in the election. Trump got scared because he IS a corrupt businessman and did not want Comey to find out his business dealings. Mueller is just carrying that same torch, except now we\'re a little more removed from the initial accusation. Now they can focus on him obstructing an investigation and lying--a much easier thing to prove--than colluding with Russian, which WAS THE ORIGINAL ACCUSATION. Do you know what an indictment is? It\'s just an accusation. It\'s not evidence or proof. Sorry if I don\'t immediately buy into (politically biased) accusations from a guy who previously tried to sell the American people the lie that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. That\'s right, your precious Mueller is just as corrupt and untrustworthy as the rest of them. Show me ONE piece of evidence showing Trump colluded with Putin! You can\'t, because if anything or the sort existed, it would have been all over mainstream media. Maybe you need to go back and reread what ignorant means.'

'A repeal of environmental regulation rules that prevented private land developers and coal factories from dumping in/contaminating bodies of water and threatening the climate.

It also indicates a disinterest of the current administration in clean, renewable energy. I\'m not super interested in having a political debate with someone over reddit so I\'m going to just leave it at the "one" act you asked for (technically the water and climate ordeals were two separate executive orders so make that double).'

If the committee wanted to burn Bannon\'s testimony by subpoenaing him and as a pretext for immunizing his testimony, that would only work if he\'d invoked his fifth amendment rights, which, by all accounts, didn\'t happen.'
"No, there's nothing like that at all. It's not uncommon for congressional investigatory bodies to defer to DOJ on certain matters to avoid publicaly revealing testimony that might impede an investigation (by, for example, allowing other witnesses to know what the testifying witness would say). Here, though, the theory appears to be that the White House, Bannon and House committee are all in cahoots, trying to burn Benson's testimony to hurt Mueller. If that were the case, nothing Mueller has done would prevent or even deter Bannon from testifying. \n\nIn addition, Maddow references Iran Contra, where several witnesses were provided immunity by Congress in exchange for testimony. At the time, it was unclear (and still sort of is, based on the case law) whether and to what extent Congress can immunize people from enforcement actions by the executive branch, but these immunizations severely hamstrung and complicated the Contra-related prosecutions. If the House committee and Bannon were trying something like that, Bannon would have needed to assert his fifth amendment rights in order to provide a pretext for the offer of immunity. If the basis for refusing to testify is only executive privilege, there's no reasonable justification for immunization. "

Can you imagine being a monster like that? God. \n\n>People say, "Well, God, aren\'t you scared of him?" **I\'m scared of not manning up. I\'m constantly in fear that I\'m not being a real man**, and I\'m not doing what it takes, and I\'m not telling the truth. And so, call it whatever you want, I look at that guy, and he\'s a sack of crap. That\'s a demon I will take down, or I\'ll die trying. So that\'s it. It\'s going to happen, we\'re going to walk out in the square, politically, at high noon, and he\'s going to find out whether he makes a move man, make the move first, and then it\'s going to happen. It\'s not a joke. It\'s not a game. It\'s the real world. Politically. You\'re going to get it, or I\'m going to die trying, bitch. Get ready. We\'re going to bang heads. We\'re going to bang heads. \n\nAnd there lies the foundation of Jones and all his basement-dwelling incel loser followers. '

"I read an article earlier where his attorneys made a motion in the court case against him filed by some of the Sandy Hook victims (where they're suing him because he claimed that it never happened and they were all crisis actors) that the case should be dismissed because, as a journalist, he has a responsibility to investigate and present all sides of a story and, as such, he is protected under the 1st Amendment. I hope the Plaintiffs' attorney uses this as Exhibit A in their opposition to that stupid ass claim. Would attach link for source but too lazy to go find it. \n\nAlso same guy who claimed he was an actor and was playing a charactor during his child custody case. Pick a narrative and stick with it, bro. "
"LOLOLOL the fuck happened to Alex, man?\n\nHe was on point years ago and then progressively got worse. But this? What the ever loving shit was THAT? He's lost it - or is he pandering to the crowd that swallows down the bs? I'd LOVE to see him step out and admit he exploited trumptards all this time."
"Mueller would beat his ass so badly he'd poop himself."
'Has anyone got any info about the Mueller allowing sex trafficking thing? Is that something people are really accusing him of or is that just Alex Jones pulling shit out of his ass?'
'Is it terrorism? Is it not just a treat against muller? '
'Nah, id rather Bobby send in his FBI agents  and arrest his ass for threating a federal prosecutor.'
'A "terroristic threat" is a legal term of art. It\'s not terrorism. It just means a credible (believable, and scary) threat to harm someone.\n\nAlex Jones regularly incites his fans to riot. He\'s pretty believable when he threatens people. '
"Use of violence for political results, incitement and threats qualify.\n\nYou don't need to ever pull a trigger to be the leader of a radical religious cult who will kill for you."
'Terrorism is the use of violence to influence behavior or philosophy. This is a threat to murder a political enemy. '
'So... Can we report him to the FBI?\n\nI mean, kids get "swatted" while streaming, so why can\'t this guy get taken down for ACTUAL threats against law enforcement?\n\nIt\'s clear his rabid fanbase already attacks the targets that he calls out. He\'s being sued by parents of the Sandy Hook shooting for defamation already, because they got SO MANY DEATH THREATS after he claimed they were actors on his show. He clearly has influence over a certaim group of people (read:morons). This is really damgerous and shouldn\'t be taken lightly.'
'It’s called “poisoning the well.” Throw out totally unfounded claims against your enemy which mirror totally credible claims that can/will be levied against your allies. Then, once the credible story about he allies comes out, people will go, “oh Trump taping kids is just more bullshit, like the whole Mueller rapes kids thing from Alex Jones.” \n\nThe nuance will be lost that one comes from our highest law enforcement agency in the country and the other came from a far, bald alcoholic screaming into a microphone.'
"So lemme get this straight.\n\nAlex Jones is making death threats to Mueller based on the fact that Mueller (who wasnt over the DoJ but probably helped investigate the sex trafficking) somehow allowed Epstein off easy. When Trump himself has admitted to going to these child rape parties?! Because its Mueller fault that he didn't stop it in time or harshly enough for Jones's liking? That's the aerial trapeze of mental gymnastics!\n\nWhat in the ever living fuck is going on in this country?!"
'Not really. Im not saying theyre better than average. But folks all over the world have been ridiculously stupid for most of our existence.\n\nUK bought into Brexit enough to pass it. There are recent examples of the populace being conned all over the world.'

'>Sorry, but the \'Russia narrative\' is far from fabricated,\n\nZero evidence. \n\n>you know foreign intelligence agencies informed the fbi, cia and nsa of these hacks since 2014. \n\nThats a different narrative. Russia always tries to hack us. Thats different from the collusion narrative. Weird how you conflate the two. \n\n>Americans get scary little information (and truth) from watching fox news all day, but you\'ll be surprise how deep the trump team was invested in Russia and how deep the reach of the Russians went.\n\nDont assume my sources. I read the same wapo nyt and CNN articles you do. All the "connections" are tangential at best and straight rumor at worst. \n\n>Every European country has a list of meetings with, for instance, kushner and Russian spies and investors, yet the only news you ever get is the trump tower meeting. That\'s literally the tip of the iceberg. \n\nSee the thing about spies is... theyre spies. Deception and infiltration is kind of their thing. Further, theyre not very good spies if we can publically identify them. \n\nAnd the thing about investors is theyre investors. Giving money to buisness ventures is kinda their thing. \n\nThats why theres still NO EVIDENCE of collusion with Russia. And A WHOLE LOT OF EVIDENCE the investigation is a sham started and/or propigated by Trump\'s political opponents. \n\nHe was elected fair and square. The left needs to accept that. Hillary was the worst candidate in modern presidential history. Occams razor suggests thats why Trump was elected. Not some vast Russian conspiracy (that didnt seem to pan out as sanctions against Russia are still in place, america is strengthening our military and opening up domestic oil reserves. All moves that are decidedly not Russian friendly) to get him elected. \n\nAt most, at the very very most, Russians probably put out some memes against Hillary because she pretty much guarenteed war with russia with her no fly zone in Syria. \n\n Anti Hillary does not mean pro Trump. \n\nEdit. Got em.\n\n\n\n\n\n'

This is a year and a half long investigAtion that has uncoveres zero evidence of collusion and yet continues to waste resources solely for the negative headlines and off chance they can nab someone with a procedural crime. \n\n>Warrants being issued, people pleading before a judge.

'I\'m starting to think this as well. From Dump\'s and his followers viewpoint, the pee tape, if it does indeed exist, can easily be defended and like what gnorn said, as long as it was consensual, his base will eat it up. Like so many other stories and scandals, he\' ll just play the waiting game and after a few months or so, newer scandals and stories will have overshadowed it.\n\nBut underage girls, now that\'s something else as it\'s actually illegal. There\'s nothing illegal about having girls pee on a bed or on yourself. These are always the first points that Dump\'s followers bring up. Well, is it illegal? they\'d ask. And usually, it would be NO, there is no criminal law saying that it is. But having sex with underage girls, now that\'s a different story. Again, he could argue that those "underage" girls were legal in Russia or that he was "told" by many people that they were. You start to notice a pattern with this moron. He always likes to deflect blame away from himself and so he concocts these ideas in his head that "many people" told him so and so. And so by doing that, he thinks he\'s free of blame.\n\nBut either way, it has to be much bigger than just normal pee tapes to get this narcissist person so scared.'

'**Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations**\n\nDonald Trump, an American businessman and current President of the United States, has been accused of sexual assault and sexual harassment, including non-consensual kissing or groping, by at least fifteen women since the 1980s. Those accusations have resulted in three widely reported instances of litigation: his then-wife Ivana made a rape claim during their 1989 divorce litigation but later recanted that claim; businesswoman Jill Harth sued Trump in 1997 alleging breach of contract while also suing for nonviolent sexual harassment but withdrew the latter suit when the former was settled; and, in 2017, former Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos filed a defamation lawsuit after Trump called her a liar.\n\nTwo of the allegations (by Ivana Trump and Jill Harth) became public before Trump\'s candidacy for president, but the rest arose after a 2005 audio recording was leaked during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump was recorded bragging that a celebrity like himself "can do anything" to women, including "just start kissing them ...\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Mueller/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

'War profiteering investigation\tEdit\nIn 1954, Trump was investigated by a U.S. Senate committee for profiteering from public contracts, including overstating his Beach Haven building charges by $3.7 million.[3] In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in 1954, William F. McKenna, appointed to investigate "scandals" within the FHA, cited Fred C. Trump and his partner William Tomasello as examples of how profits were made by builders using the FHA.[citation needed] McKenna said the two paid $34,200 for a piece of land which they rented to their corporation for over $60,000 per year in a 99-year lease, so that if the apartment they built on it ever defaulted, the FHA would owe $1.5 million on it. McKenna said that Trump and Tomasello obtained loans for $3.5 million more than the apartments cost.[citation needed] Trump testified before the Senate Banking Committee the following month as it investigated "windfall profits." He said that builders would not have built apartments under an expired post-war loan insurance program if regulations had set inflexible limits on loans issued by the '

'>phony dossier \n\n😂😂😂\n\nHa you wish. You got a link, comrade? Lots has been confirmed. Nothing has been disproven.\n\n**Dossier Claim: Russia Meddled**\n\nRevelation: The U.S. intelligence apparatus concluded that Russia interfered in 2016’s election in a report released in January 2017. Though Steele’s name is not mentioned in that report, it does back up his reporting that Russia was actively interfering in the election process.\n\n**Dossier Claim: Russia Had Dirt on Clinton and DNC**\n\nRevelation: Much of the dossier is devoted not only to Trump but to Russia’s—specifically Putin’s—distaste for former Secretary of State Clinton. “Putin motivated by fear and hatred of Hillary Clinton,” one line of the dossier reads. Another line said: “The two sides had a mutual interest in defeating Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, whom President Putin apparently both hated and feared.”\n\nSteele later cites one source as stating Russia that was behind the leak of hacked Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails to WikiLeaks.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community confirmed not only that Russia had tried to meddle in the election but that it was the source of the hacked DNC emails released by WikiLeaks.\n\n**Dossier Claim: Putin Was in Charge**\n\nRevelation: On the very first page of the dossier, Steele explains that the election meddling was “endorsed by Putin” and that the effort was “both supported and directed” by him. The U.S. intelligence report reached the same conclusion, writing that Putin “ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the presidential election.” According to Steele’s sources, Putin and Russia had been cultivating Trump for “at least 5 years.”\n\n**Dossier Claim: Mr. Cohen Goes to Prague**\n\nRevelation: The president’s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, was accused in the dossier of meeting with “Kremlin representatives” in Prague in August 2016. Cohen has repeatedly denied traveling to the Czech capital, but McClatchy last month reported that Mueller had evidence the trip happened.\n\nThe report stated that Mueller’s team discovered proof Cohen got to Prague through Germany. The two countries are part of a number of European nations with an open borders agreement that allows undocumented travel. However, no other media outlet has been able to confirm McClatchy’s reporting.\n\n**Dossier Claim: Russian Diplomat Was a Spy**\n\nRevelation: Steele also claimed that Russia was worried a diplomat named Mikhail Kalugin was heavily involved in the meddling operation. Afraid he would be exposed, Russia pulled Kalugin out of Washington on “short notice.” Steele actually misspelled Kalugin’s name, but the U.S. government had identified Kalugin as a Russian spy, the BBC reported in March.\n\n**Dossier Claim: Page Met With Russians**\n\nRevelation: Carter Page previously denied having met with Russian government officials during his trip to Russia in July 2016, but he admitted to the meeting while speaking to the House Intelligence Committee last November. Page was a foreign policy adviser to Trump’s campaign and in June 2016 delivered a speech in Washington praising Putin. And as early as September 2016, U.S. officials were looking into Page’s contacts in Russia, Yahoo News reported.\n\n**Dossier Claim: Manafort Received Payment for Work in Ukraine**\n\nRevelation: Paul Manafort, who is facing serious charges from Mueller’s team, worked extensively in Ukraine for years before Trump hired him as campaign chairman in 2016. The longtime Washington lobbyist received $12.7 million from the political party of former pro-Russia Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych between 2007 and 2012, The New York Times reported on August 14, 2016. Manafort resigned from the campaign after that report.\n\nSteele’s dossier states that Yanukovych and Putin met the day after the story broke, and the former made assurances to the latter that no trail could be found.\n\n“This had been held in secret on 15 August near Volgograd, Russia, and the Western media revelations about Manafort and Ukraine had featured prominently on the agenda,” the dossier says about the meeting. “Yanukovych had confided in Putin that he did authorize and order substantial kick-back payments to Manafort as alleged but sought to reassure him that there was no document trail left behind which could provide clear evidence of this.”\n\nIn April 2017, financial records unearthed by the Associated Press confirmed that at least $1.2 million went to Manafort’s company from Ukraine.\n\nhttps://www.newsweek.com/trump-russia-dossier-true-proven-929839'

"Oh, I should add:\n\nThis was a **trial** for treason.

That's up to Congress and the President, since they are the ones who declare war and command a response.\n\nNow, you might say -- well, we need this definition to decide if Trump is a traitor or not. If this was an act of war, then his actions with respect to Russia would be potentially treasonous.\n\nBut, that is not actually relevant. People have been tried and sentenced for treason for assisting countries we were not technically at war with -- eg the Rosenbergs.\n\nSo, I don't know why you're making a fuss about this case."

That his attempts to cover up the crime precipitated a worse controversy than the original crime itself? If Trump continues to obstruct the investigation, then we've got a constitutional crisis.

'It’s a disgrace unless it involves his fat orange ass or one of his cronies. Only an idiot would listen to that fat fuck.'
"It's an amendment in the US constitution which allows defendants to not have to testify against themselves. It does make their position worse, but less worse than if they would be forced to testify against themselves."
"I'd just like to elaborate a point: per American law, there is no detriment to refusing to testify; juries are not allowed to make an adverse inference because a defendant pleads the 5th. In practice however, it does look bad and those that plead the 5th get convicted a lot more than those who testify."
"I don't believe pleading the fifth counts as an admission of guilt, but it does make the defendant look guilty, and a jury is allowed to make a negative inference from it. It does look shifty as hell, and shows what a desperate position he's in."
"Sort of. Key phrase bolded.\n\n> AMENDMENT V: No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; **nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself**, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\n\nThere are two kinds of trials, civil and criminal. Basically, if you plead the fifth in a criminal trial, the prosecution isn't allowed to call you as a witness. So you can't be tried by ordeal or convicted on the basis that you refused to talk. In America, you're innocent unless the prosecution proves you guilty, so (theoretically) even if pleading the fifth makes you look shifty, the jury still isn't supposed to charge you unless the prosecutor can actually *prove* you dunnit.\n\nMostly doesn't apply in civil cases, but the stakes are lower in civil court. And there's even an exception to let you plead the 5th if testifying might (truly or falsely) implicate you in criminal charges."
'I’m liking it. /u/spez’s nonsense post today was a waste of everyone’s time.  Not sure why he bothered.  \n\nGlad that the media has also stopped calling Reddit and Twitter “Tech Companies”. Call ‘em what they are - “Social Media Companies”.   \n\nAt best, they’re community billboards, at worst, they’re communal toilets. We see examples of both simultaneously here on Reddit.'
"It's not even with that much grey area. People were pointing out subs that were centered on animal and human torture and killing that they've reported multiple times and the admins still gave their bullshit responses. "
'Nah mate Redittors are Redditors who are missing chromosomes (like me) and it speaks that even Redittors like me are speaking out against this bullshit. *sarcasm* *sarcasm* *sarcasm*'
'**How to know when T_D are scared:** They attack the spelling, Grammar and or poster of the argument instead of logically reasoning.'
"People already thought that Pence's not going to be implicated in the worst possible sense, and then he said that...\n\nMan, Stupid Watergate confirmed."
"Time to act if that happens.\n\nA country doesn't remain free by sitting on it's ass when a dictator tries to seize power."
'BYE BITCH BOY TRUMP. GO TO PRISON WITH YOUR SONS AND DAUGHTER'
'Yes, you are. Do you (and the WaPo) not realize the difference? Every time a democrat is elected this country is a communism and every time a republican is elected we are a dictatorship/fascism. To go swinging comparing what is happening to Italy in WW2 is vain and disgusting, and completely ignores the crimes against humanity that occurred. \n\nSoon trump will be out of office. He’s not here to stay. Take a deep breath and realize the world isn’t ending. '
"There's probably enough dirt on the Trump Soho mess to lock him up but Mueller is really gunning for the rest of his criminal enterprise, including Jared, Ivanka and Don Jr. "
'> The narrative never changes and the sky is always falling. \n\nPretending Trump is akin to any president before him is disingenuous.  Yes GWB was bad, but I never believed his administration to be in utter chaos as Trump\'s has been from day one.  Also no other president has needed "handlers" like Trump has, and he\'s started to shed all his handlers now.'
"The one consistent lesson taught by those who lived through fascist Europe is to always stay vigilant and never say it can't happen here. This is a major theme in every biography and first-person account. It's said over and over as a warning to the future.\n\nSo while I understand and appreciate your point, I will also heed the voices of those who actually lived through these catastrophic events. "
'No, I’m simply not saying that this is a fascist dictator who’s killed countless political opponents. \n\nTo compare the two is the same thing the republicans did when they said Obama was literally Hitler. '
'The rest of the world is relying on you guys to get out there and vote. Please do! They say the Dems have no message but fuck them and fuck Trump. The man is the antithesis of western liberal democracy an enlightenment values. That’s the god damned message!\n\nThe rest of us are right behind you.'
"I upvoted this. Perhaps I was too cavilier here—if the House chooses to impeach after November, public opinion could take hold, and Republicans in the Senate could flip—maybe Trump will run like Nixon did.  Why would they scoff at a Mike Pense presidency (given he doesn't get tangled up in the Mueller probe)? They know him, therefore they can work with him.  Trump ushered in the donor class tax cuts, and I think after they will grow tired of him very shortly. He served his purpose, but his ego cannot be supported or held—there are discontents emerging between Trump and the oligarchs regarding these foolish tariffs. \n\nMaybe I'm wrong. We shall see "
"The folks who voted him in, the GOP's open embrace of overt racism, his Supreme Court picks, a weakened regulatory framework, environmental damage, and weakened/strained relationships with historical allies and trade partners... The negative effects of his presidency will reverberate for 50 years - more if he starts a war."
'Yall are gunna be so sad when Mueller doesnt do anything.'
'Hasn’t he done quite a lot already..?\n4 people charged with 2 pleaded guilty and cooperating. Indeed from what he has done it seems very likely that he’s just gonna stop here and go golfing :)'
'Y so mad? rage inducing indictments eh?'
